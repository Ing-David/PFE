ESTIMATION OF THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF WOOD FROM Eucalyptus urophylla USING NEAR INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY ESTIMATIVA DE PROPRIEDADES MECÂNICAS DA MADEIRA DE Eucalyptus urophylla USANDO A ESPECTROSCOPIA NO INFRAVERMELHO PRÓXIMO,,"INTRODUCTION Properties relating to wood resistance include bend strength, also known as modulus of rupture, compressive strength, tensile strength, shear strength, stiffness, among others. And properties relating to wood elasticity include modulus of elasticity, Poisson coefficient, plasticity and resilience  (KOLLMANN & CÔTÉ JUNIOR 1968) . Strength in compression parallel to grain is the maximum load in the direction of the length a sample is ANDRADE, C. R. et al. capable of sustaining  (KOLLMANN & COTÊ JÚNIOR 1968) . Modulus of rupture reflects a sample's ability to resist deformation when it is subjected to bending and is equivalent to the maximum moment shown by the sample  (GREEN et al. 1999) .  Klock (2000)  reports that high MOE values indicate a material's high strength and low deformation characteristics, which means it will qualify for structural works. Typically, mechanical characterization of wood is done by destructive analysis of samples, using specific equipment that involves extensive, standard-based testing routines and capable of providing reliable results. However, this type of assessment requires a long lead time between preparing samples and arriving at final values for the relevant property. Many researches have been conducted into alternative methods for fast and reliable wood characterization that, along with traditional methods, can result both in analysis quality and time gains. Among recently developed nondestructive methods for wood characterization is the near infrared spectroscopy technique (NIRS). According to  Baillères et al. (2002) , near infrared spectroscopy is a noninvasive analysis technique for organic materials, largely used by various manufacturing companies, forest sector included, in quality control and process monitoring tasks. The above method can offer advantages in relation to traditional methods, as it is considered nondestructive and fast (one minute or less per sample)  (PASQUINI 2003) . The basic principle is measuring absorbance spectra in the near infrared region of relevant samples, which then have their properties determined by traditional destructive analysis in a laboratory. NIR spectra are then subjected to regression analysis by the partial least square method (PLS), which is the most common method in calibration for model construction, using spectral signals  (GELADI & KOWALSKI 1986 ). Once the model has been calibrated for a given property, calibration should be tested for accuracy by a process known as validation. Model validation can be accomplished in two ways, namely external validation and cross validation  (MARTENS & NAES 1996) . External validation is considered simpler, yet it has the disadvantage of requiring another sample set, implying use of spectral measurement and conventional analysis and thus increasing time on task and procedure costs  (SOTELO 2006) . In cross validation, samples awaiting validation are the same samples used in the calibration test. Some samples are set aside, a model is constructed with the remaining samples and prediction is done in relation to samples initially set aside. This type of validation is recommended where a small number of samples is involved. Several works have demonstrated the use potential of near infrared spectroscopy to determine wood properties, as, for example, studies developed by  Fujimoto et al. (2008)  and  Schimleck et al. (1999)  into density and also into strength and stiffness properties.  Viana et al. (2009) , by using NIRS technique for predicting the morfological characteristics and basic density, found interesting results.  Hein (2010)  found similar results for basic density in Eucalyptus hybrids. Studies were also conducted into mechanical strength  (THUMM & MEDER 2001) . While studying E. grandis and E. urophylla,  Hein et al. (2009)  evaluated estimation of strength and elasticity in compression parallel to grain and found coefficients of determination of cross validation of 0.78 and 0.75 respectively. Ribeiro  (2009)  used the same technique to predict physical and mechanical properties of softwoods and hardwoods and found it to be a very effective technique, economically and practically speaking.  Kelley et al. (2004)  demonstrated the use potential of the NIRS technique to reliably predict mechanical properties of wood. Being a noninvasive technique, the use of NIRS to investigate mechanical properties of wood is extremely promising, potentially translating as considerable gains in time and resources (wood). With that said,  Pasquini (2003)  reports that where measurements are taken in diffuse reflectance mode, the NIRS technique can pose some problems, e.g. light dispersion and inaccuracies, due to differences in sample thickness. Therefore, using techniques that will help reduce, eliminate or standardize the effect of unwanted factors on spectra and yet maintain the spectroscopic information unchanged  (SIESLER et al. 2002)  is extremely important. Examples of such techniques include first and second derivative and multiplicative signal correction methods. This research used the NIRS technique to estimate mechanical properties of wood from a Eucalyptus urophylla hybrid, as determined by static bending and compression parallel to grain testing. 
 MATERIAL AND METHODS 
 Biological material and sampling An Eucalyptus urophylla hybrid aged 7 years was obtained from a commercial crop grown by V&M Florestal, Estimation of the mechanical properties of wood ... a company located in the municipality of Paraopeba, Minas Gerais state, Brazil. Sampling was done using a single tree divided into lengthwise and widthwise sections. The stem was divided into 5 logs, each log being 5 meters long. Each log section was divided into planks, each plank being 150 cm. This material was processed using a band saw and defect-free specimens were taken for static bending tests (25 x 25 x 410 mm in size) and compression parallel to grain tests (25 x 25 x 100 mm in size) from the outer, central and inner portions of the plank, with well-oriented radial and tangential faces. Mechanical tests were performed in a universal testing machine EMIC DL 30000. Tests were run according to the ASTM D 143 -94 standard (1997). 
 NIR spectral acquisition For spectral acquisition, a Bruker MPA-R spectrometer was used, equipped with software Opus version 5.5. This equipment uses the Fourier transform and has an integrating sphere. Spectral acquisition was conducted in the 800 to 1,500 nm range, in diffuse reflectance mode, with spectral resolution of 8 cm -1 and 64 scans per reading. Readings were taken of solid wood spectra (on radial, tangential and transverse faces), then samples were ground and spectral readings were taken in ground wood retained in a 60-mesh sieve. The procedure of spectral acquisition is illustrated in  Figure 1 .   
 Parameters of calibration, validation and model selection Software The Unscrambler ® version 9.1. was used as a calibration tool. Models were fitted using the partial least square regression method (PLS-1), with a maximum of 10 latent variables, and the value adopted for each model was suggested by the statistical program. The validation method used in this work was cross validation. To eliminate some of the noise and improve signal quality, first and second derivative pretreatments were applied to spectral information, using the algorithm proposed by  Savitzky & Golay (1964) . Second order polynomials were used with a spectral window of seven variables. A third pretreatment-multiplicative signal correction (MSC)-was also adopted to minimize the chance of any interference in solid wood spectral data. Outliers were detected by using the plot of Student's residuals as a parameter and were not included in model calibration. Model selection was based on the following criteria: (1st) higher correlation coefficient of cross validation (r); (2nd) higher ratio of deviation performance, (3rd) lower number of latent variables used in calibration and (4th) standard error of cross validation SECV. Values shown in  Table 1  for modulus of elasticity, strength in compression parallel to grain and modulus of rupture are similar to results found by  Hein et al. (2009) , who obtained 7848 MPa for modulus of elasticity in compression parallel to grain testing while investigating Eucalyptus grandis and E. urophylla at age 6.5 years.  Silva et al. (2005)  worked with Eucalyptus grandis at different ages and obtained 129230 kgf/cm 2 (equivalent to 12673 MPa) as means of modulus of elasticity in static bending testing.  Cruz et al. (2003)  assessed Eucalyptus clones at age 5.5 to 10.5 years and obtained 15044 MPa as mean of modulus of elasticity in static bending testing, and 7657 MPa as mean of modulus of elasticity in compression parallel to grain testing. 
 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 Mechanical properties of wood 
 Calibration of mechanical properties of wood Cell exposure in wood will differ depending on the face being assessed-radial (Rd), tangential (Tg) or transverse (Tr). It is thus expected, for instance, that the greater exposure of parenchyma cells on the radial face will produce different spectral information, and this information in turn can correlate positively or negatively with mechanical properties of wood  (HEIN et al. 2009 ). Based on this information, solid wood calibrations included all 3 faces-radial (Rd), tangential (Tg) and transverse (Tr)-, then an average spectral value of all three faces was worked out (mean), followed by new calibrations.  Table 2  summarizes best calibration results for mechanical properties of wood based on spectral information read on the radial, tangential and transverse faces of solid wood, in addition to spectral means. Results of cross validation correlation are similar to those found by  Hein et al. (2009) , who worked with Eucalyptus grandis and E. urophylla clones at age 6.5 years and reported a coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.75 in cross validation for modulus of elasticity (MOE) in compression parallel testing. For strength in compression parallel (CS), the model presented a R² p of 0.73 in cross validation. In static bending testing, the best observed values for modulus of elasticity were r=0.91 and RPD=2.5, using tangential face spectra. The best observed values for modulus of rupture was the spectral mean of all three faces, with values r=0.75 and RPD=1.5.  So et al. (2002)  obtained good calibrations to estimate modulus of elasticity (R²=0.87) while performing bending tests in wood from Pinus taeda L. at ages 15 to 55 years. As regards use of pretreatments, best correlations were obtained when original spectra were used, except for compressive strength which had its best observed value when multiplicative signal correction was applied. Overall, best correlation values for compression parallel testing were obtained when using transverse face spectra, followed by tangential face and then radial face spectra. As for bending testing, best responses were observed when using tangential face spectra, followed by transverse face and then radial face. Differences in spectral information depending on the face measured-whether the radial, tangential or transverse section-are yet to be better established  (HEIN et al. 2009 ).  Fujimoto et al. (2008)  used spectral information from tangential (R² between 0.61 and 0.84) and radial (R² between 0.73 and 0.89) faces to estimate mechanical properties of two species of genus Larix and concluded that both spectra present the same overall tendency as to calibration. It should be noted that in this particular work calibrations for mechanical properties were based on a small number of samples (n), and also that new studies should be undertaken to investigate the influence of Estimation of the mechanical properties of wood ...

Figure 2  provides a correlation graph between estimated and measured modulus of elasticity in compression parallel to grain testing on the transverse face. There is a strong association between observed and predicted values, indicating the use potential of NIRS to estimate modulus of elasticity from solid wood.  Table 3  summarizes best calibration results for mechanical properties using ground wood spectra.

 Prop -Properties It was noted that modulus of elasticity in compression parallel testing presents the best value of cross validation correlation, with r=0.87 and RPD=2. Modulus of elasticity also presents the same number of latent variables and Outlier in both tests, compression and bending, LV=3 and Outlier=1. First and second derivative pretreatments provided the best correlation values overall. According to  Schimleck et al. (2003) , a RPD value higher than 1.5 is considered satisfactory for preliminary readings and predictions (screenings), and for tree selection in forest improvement programs. According to Tables 2 and 3, it can be said that calibrations obtained from solid wood spectra were slightly higher than calibrations obtained from ground wood spectra, considering both tests and each of the three properties being tested-MOE, CS and MOR. Cross validation correlations for mechanical properties using solid wood spectra and ground wood spectra overall presented positive values. However, these values can be improved if in future works a larger number of samples is included in the calibration lot.     
 CONCLUSIONS Best correlation coefficients to estimate modulus of elasticity and compressive strength, in compression parallel to grain testing, were obtained when using original spectra from solid wood. Modulus of elasticity in static bending testing was best estimated when solid wood spectra were subjected to first derivative treatment, while modulus of rupture presented best calibrations when original spectra were used.

USE OF NEAR INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY TO DISTINGUISH CARBONIZATION PROCESSES AND CHARCOAL SOURCES USO DA ESPECTROSCOPIA NO INFRAVERMELHO PRÓXIMO PARA DIFERENCIAR PROCESSOS DE CARBONIZAÇÃO E FONTES DE CARVÃO VEGETAL,,"INTRODUCTION The carbonization of wood is the process of thermal decomposition of wood, occurring in the absence or presence of controlled quantities of oxygen, generating a solid residue called charcoal  (WENZL, 1970) , and the generation of condensed and non-condensable gases. During this process the wood is subjected to the action of heat at relatively high temperatures, undergoing a transformation process in which all components are extensively modified . The components modified during carbonization are from cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignin and extractives. The 
 MONTEIRO, T. C. et al. behavior of the chemical constituents of wood together with the factors leading to the carbonization process such as heating rate and final temperature should be evaluated for the best homogeneity of charcoal produced. The chemical components of wood are degraded in different temperature ranges: hemicelluloses between 200 and 380°C, cellulose from 250 to 380°C and lignin between 180 and 900°C  (GASPAROVIC et al., 2009) . Depending on the wood sample size, different temperature ranges can occur simultaneously and, depending on the volume and the oven, carbonization at different temperatures are found along the profile  (TRUGILHO & SILVA, 2001) . Thus, one sample of wood can provide the degradation of different components at the same time. Due to variations occurring during carbonization, the charcoal produced is a heterogeneous chemical compound and in some charcoal it is almost pure carbon, while in others it undergoes a partial carbonization process having significant amounts of oxygen and hydrogen  (PINHEIRO et al., 2005) . Some studies evaluated the properties of charcoal as a function of final temperature and heating rate.  Trugilho & Silva (2001)  evaluated the influence of these parameters in Jatobá (Himenea courbaril) charcoal founding differences in fixed carbon, volatiles, ash and other yields, which depends on the final temperature of carbonization.  Pinheiro et al. (2005)  studied the influence of temperature and heating rate on the properties of charcoal from Eucalyptus and obtained difference in yields of gravity and fixed carbon content, and the optimum temperature of the carbonization process in the range from 300 to 450ºC for Eucalyptus and the slower process increased the yield in charcoal. Charcoal with uniform properties is important when its use is intended for steel mill blast furnaces to produce metal or iron. Features such as the fixed carbon content, volatile matter, ash, moisture, density, porosity, compressive strength, particle size, reactivity and other limiting factors account for the operation of blast furnaces, since the coal during its use has the functions of a fuel element and reducer  (SANTOS, 2008) . The chemical constituents of charcoal, fixed carbon and volatiles are used in processing iron-ore in metal or iron, and ash content of less than 1% is embedded in the metal producing impurity  (SAMPAIO, 2004) . Quality control analysis of charcoal used in blast furnaces is generally limited due to the large number of samples required, high sampling costs and slowness in obtaining results, making the characterization of the industrial charcoal technically and economically impractical . Hence, the energy industry requires new solutions for controlling the quality of their charcoal in order to maintain the same quality standard. A suitable technique for characterization a range of materials is near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy  (BURNS & CIURCZAK, 2001 ). The technique is described by  Pasquini (2003)  as fast (one minute or less for analysis), non-destructive, applicable to any biological material, including online procedures and it requires minimum or no sample preparation. The association of NIR spectroscopy with multivariate analysis has allowed the study of quantitative and qualitative characteristics on a large scale of samples, covering sectors such as textile industry, fossil fuels, agriculture, food, pharmaceutical and forestry  (TSUCHIKAWA, 2007) . In forestry researches, this technique has been used as a rapid tool for tree phenotyping in breeding programs  (SCHIMLECK, 2008) . The main wood traits assessed by NIR spectroscopy are the chemical  (SANTOS et al., 2009 ) and morphological properties  (VIANA et al., 2009)  and the wood density  (HEIN et al., 2009a)  due to their high cost for large-scale measurement. In regard to the charcoal assessment by NIR spectroscopy, there are few works available in the literature. In Brazil, a work was conducted by  Barcellos (2007)  who assessed the fixed carbon content, volatiles and calorific value of charcoal produced from native species and the genus Eucalyptus by NIR spectroscopy. This author used multiple linear regression and obtained good correlation (0.83 to 0.97) between the properties determined in the laboratory and the spectral information in the charcoal measurements.  evaluated the performance of NIR spectroscopy combined with multivariate models to estimate the levels of volatiles and fixed carbon of charcoal produced from Eucalyptus. The authors used the partial least squares regression to correlate the levels of volatiles and fixed carbon to the spectral information and found determination of prediction coefficients of 0.85 for volatiles levels and 0.86 for fixed carbon estimate.  showed even more promising results when using more elaborate techniques, such as the selection of more informative wavelengths and application of spectral processing. The author evaluated the charcoal produced from 168 hybrids of Eucalyptus grandis and Eucalyptus urophylla and obtained predictive models with determination coefficient of 0.95 of volatile material content and 0.96 for fixed carbon Use of near infrared spectroscopy to distinguish ... content, indicating that NIR spectroscopy technique can be used to estimate, with accuracy, charcoal properties. Based on the works of other industries it is believed that this technique has a wide range of applications to be explored for charcoal and energy industry. Just as in the pharmaceutical sector, which uses NIR spectroscopy combined with principal component analysis to identify false medicines  (FRASSON SCAFI & PASQUINI, 2001)  and in food industry, which uses these techniques to identify adultered fruit juice  (TWOMEY et al., 2006)  or adulterants in olive oil  (WESLEY et al., 1996) , it is suspected that spectra principal component analysis in the near infrared region can be used in charcoal to distinguish species and carbonization processes. Considering the serious environmental problems caused by deforestation of native forests for illegal charcoal production, the application of this technique would be useful to monitor and assist the supervision of charcoal. Currently, there is no fast and safe method to classify and distinguish charcoal origin (wood from native or planted forest) and the process of carbonization which is, according to  Mendes et al. (1982) , directly related to immediate charcoal chemistry, especially the fixed carbon levels and volatile material in charcoal Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of Near Infrared Spectroscopy associated to the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to discriminate the carbonization processes and identification of the origin of wood used in carbonization. 
 MATERIAL AND METHODS 
 Sampling The charcoal used in this work was from Eucalyptus and native species produced by three different carbonization processes, namely: i) unknown -samples of charcoal were obtained from Eucalyptus in local commerce, produced by unknown processes of carbonization; ii) Industrial furnace -fifteen random samples of charcoal were removed from two industrial FR-190 rectangular kilns, which belong to Vallourec & Mannesmann (V&M) Florestal Ltda company, located in Paraopeba, Minas Gerais, Brazil. These industrial kilns are brick made and have nominal capacity to produce 190 cubic meters of charcoal. Their dimensions are 16 m x 4 m x 4.5 m in length, width and height respectively. As performed by  Fávero et al. (2007) , Eucalyptus logs of 3.60 m in length were arranged in four logs piles, parallel to the longitudinal direction of the furnace and kiln. The complete cycle lasted 12 days, going through the steps of loading the logs, ignition, drying, carbonization, cooling and unloading, and after this 15 samples were taken randomly and iii) Laboratorylaboratory muffle furnace of the University Federal of Lavras (UFLA muffle furnace) -twenty native trees and seven Eucalyptus trees were used to produce charcoal in an electric furnace of the Biomass Energy Laboratory at the UFLA. There was collected one disk per tree at diameter breast heigh (1.3 meters from the soil) with longitudinal thickness of approximately 4.5 cm and variable diameter (  Table 1) . Discs of native species were provided and identified by the ""Minas Gerais Forest Inventory Project -Instituto Estadual de Florestas, MG -UFLA"". Discs of Eucalyptus were collected from two trees felled on the campus of UFLA, another three trees were supplied by Gerdau company and other two trees supplied by V&M Florestal. From the discs opposite wedges were removed for carbonization.  Table 1  shows the data for the samples of charcoal obtained in all cases. 
 Parameters of experimental carbonization -UFLA The carbonizations were performed in electric muffle furnace adapted with a carbonization capsule as described by  Trugilho et al. (2005) . The samples were subjected to the final temperature of 450°C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min, and there were two replicates for each species. The charcoal samples were then grinded; homogenized and taken to a climatic room with air temperature of 20°C ± 2°C and relative humidity of 60% ± 5% staying there until constant mass was obtained. 
 Acquisition of NIR spectra data The acquisition of the NIR spectra was performed using a Bruker spectrometer (MPA model, Bruker Optik GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany), operating with its software  (OPUS v. 4.2) . Fourier transform spectrometer is designed for reflectance analysis of solids with an integrating sphere. Spectral acquisition was performed in diffuse reflection mode in the 4,000 to 12,500 cm -1 range with a spectral resolution of 8 cm -1 . A sintered gold standard was used as background. Two NIR spectra were measured for each sample, each NIR spectrum representing an average of 64 readings. The NIR spectra were measured from samples of grinded charcoal. The spectral information was measured in a climatic room with temperature of 20°C ± 2°C and relative humidity of 60% ± 5%. Under these conditions, the equilibrium moisture content of charcoal samples was 12%.

 Principal component analysis parameters NIR spectral differences were detected by means of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA was determined with a maximum of twelve major components using the Unscrambler (CAMO AS, Norway) software version 9.7. The tests were verified by full cross-validation method. In order to suppress the noise and improve the quality of the signal, the pre-treatment of the first and second derivative were employed in spectral information. First derivatives (13-point filter and a second order Use of near infrared spectroscopy to distinguish ...  polynomial) and second derivatives (25-point filter and a third order polynomial) were applied on the NIR spectra data using  Savitzky & Golay (1964)  algorithm. To detect anomalous samples the Student residual and leverage values plot were analyzed, as described in  Hein et al. (2009a) . Samples rated as anomalous were not included in PCA. The Marten´s uncertainty test  (WESTAD & MARTENS, 2000)  was used to select the wavenumbers with significant loadings. 
 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 NIR spectral information NIR spectra measurement was performed in diffuse reflection mode, directly on the material.  Figure 1  shows NIR absorption spectra for charcoal and the overlap and combination regions of the absorption bands. The spectra are presented in the range of 4,000 to 12,500 cm -1 and were acquired with a spectral resolution of 8 cm -1 . Notes on the first and third harmonic of the presence of absorption peaks are in  Figure 1 . According to  Giordanengo (2005) , the peaks indicated by arrows  (Figure 1 ) correspond to carbon double bonds and connections with aromatic groups. The combinations and first overtone zones of NIR spectra of charcoal are represented mainly by noise and no information can be obtained. 
 Identification of charcoal from native forests and planted forests NIR spectral differences between samples are easily visualized by means of two-dimensional scatter plot from Principal Component Analysis  (HEIN et al., 2009b) . In this study, it was performed PCA in order to identify the samples of charcoal as its origin.  Figure 2  shows the scores of principal component (PC) 1 and PC 2 from PCA of the raw spectra of charcoal samples from planted and native forests. For the spectra obtained from the original charcoal, two principal components explain 99% of the variability of the data analyzed, and 80% is explained by the PC 1 and 19% by PC 2. It was not possible to distinguish charcoal of planted forests from charcoal of native forests by means MONTEIRO, T. C. et al.  of the PCA of raw spectra. The strong colinearity of charcoal NIR spectra should play a major role on Principal Components Analysis hampering the findings and difficulting its interpretation. Application of the first derivative on the raw spectral information can reduce the effect of inclination caused on the spectrum baseline  (MARTENS & TORMOD, 1989) . Thus, the PCA was also performed on the derivative of the charcoal spectra, with the same aim of separating charcoal from native and planted forests by PCA scores graph.  Figure 3  shows PCA scores of charcoal samples obtained on first derivative spectra. For the first charcoal spectra derivative, two principal components explain only 17% of data variability, and 9% is explained by the PC 1 and 8% by the PC 2. The remaining 83% are explained by the components PC3 to PC12. The application of spectral treatment resulted in a large reduction in the ability of PCA to capture the variation among samples  (Figure 3 ). The mathematical treatments on NIR spectra correct the differences in optical path of the light and the difference between the particle sizes of charcoal samples  (GIORDANENGO, 2005) . For charcoal samples, the first derivative of NIR spectra did not improve the signal and, similarly to the raw NIR spectra  (Figure 2) , it was not possible to distinguish charcoal of planted forests from that of native forests through the score plot of PC1 and PC2. Physical factors may have contributed to this phenomenon; for instance, differences of size between the particle of charcoal powder and its interaction with the light. It is known that sample preparation influences the information contained within the NIR spectra. Recently,  Hein et al. (2010)  demonstrated the effect of particle size of the wood powders on the NIR spectra and its implications on multivariate analysis. 
 Separation of carbonization processes In order to separate the charcoal samples according to the carbonization process used, the same PCA was performed on the spectral information of charcoal samples.  Figure 4  shows the principal component scores PC 1 and PC 2 from raw spectra PCA of charcoal samples produced by the three carbonization processes. Use of near infrared spectroscopy to distinguish ...      For the spectra obtained from the original charcoal samples, similarly to the observed in the first analysis  (Figure 2) , two principal components explained 99% of the analyzed data variability; in which PC 1 explain 89% and PC 2 explain 10% of the spectral variability. The charcoal samples have some uniformity and it is not possible to distinguish the carbonization process that originated samples by PCA of the raw spectra. However, the first charcoal spectra derivative was able to separate the charcoal samples according to the carbonization process.  Figure 5  shows PCA analysis scores of the spectra processed by the first derivative. The first principal component (  Figure 5) , which explains 80% of the data variability, associated to the PC2 (19%), clearly segregates the charcoal produced by the industrial furnace (Group A) and the laboratory furnace (Group B). The charcoal produced at UFLA presented a well defined grouping because it was carried out in the laboratory under highly controlled process. The grouping of samples from the industrial charcoal showed a scattering due to the factors inherent to the industrial furnace and raw material. According to  Fávero et al. (2007)  this process does not provide uniformity in the parameters of temperature and heating rate and others, due to geometric characteristics of the furnace and the wood bed.  Pinheiro et al. (2005)  comments that it is difficult to precisely control the speed of carbonization in industrial furnaces due to the gas flow field and internal temperature, and because the biomass characteristics such as humidity, diameter, length and position.  Mendes et al. (1982)  showed that the levels of fixed carbon and volatiles from charcoal vary with the place where the charcoal was produced inside the furnace. The same author also pointed out that the immediate chemistry of the charcoal is controlled, among other factors by the carbonization process. In our study, the carbonization process was considered as the responsible for the differences observed between groups A and B. Samples of commercial charcoal, from planted forests, but with an unknown carbonization process were grouped among the charcoal produced in the laboratory furnace UFLA (Group B). It is important to note that this group includes charcoal produced from planted and native forests wood. Use of near infrared spectroscopy to distinguish ... 
 CONCLUSIONS The results obtained in this experimental program suggest that the principal component analysis of the charcoal spectra -after pretreatment of the first derivativeis a promising technique in the evaluation of charcoal quality. The technique was able to separate charcoal in two groups, according to carbonization process: industrial or laboratorial one. In regard to the industrial process, two groups were obtained probably due to the geometric characteristics and volume of the oven as well as the heterogeneity of the raw material. It was not possible to detect the source of charcoal (from native or planted forest) by the principal components analysis of spectral information. The results presented in this preliminary work indicate that the association of near infrared spectroscopy with multivariate techniques of qualitative analysis is promising to distinguish charcoal from information contained in near infrared spectrum. Therefore, further studies are required to generate a better understanding about these issues.

So besides sugar cane, Reunion's historical crop, vegetable production represented nearly 42 000 t in 2006, with a surface area of 1800 ha, i.e., slightly less than fruit production [1]. However, many pests and diseases threaten the profitability of this agricultural sector  [2] , forcing farmers to resort to synthetic pesticides with all the risks that this entails for human health and the environment. Fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae) figure among the main pests for solanaceous crops (in particular, fieldgrown tomato, Lycopersicum esculentum Mill.) and cucurbits: cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), zucchini (Cucurbita pepo L.), melon (Cucumis melo L.), etc. Losses of as much as 80% of tomato and 100% of cucurbit crop harvests have been frequently observed. According to farmers, fruit fly damage to vegetable crops has become significantly greater since the 1990s, although the various species concerned had been reported for several decades  [3] . Broad-spectrum insecticides, often unauthorized for the given crop, have been used at high doses and frequencies, without rotation of chemical families, which has probably negatively impacted on natural enemies of these pests and led to development of resistance. These practices have led to the impossibility of maintaining populations below an economic threshold. Besides poor management of this chemical control and the use of unsuitable insecticides, other hypotheses regarding changes of cropping practices could explain these proliferations: spatial expansion and, during other seasons of cultivated and wild host plants, lack of rotation and fallow, introduction of more susceptible varieties, and relaxation in the application of prophylaxis recommendations. 
 Inventory and distribution Four fruit fly species belonging to the Tephritidae family cause major damage to vegetable crops in Reunion: Bactrocera cucurbitae (Coquillet), Dacus ciliatus Loew and D. demmerezi (Bezzi) on Cucurbitaceae, and Neoceratitis cyanescens (Bezzi) on Solanaceae (primarily the tomato)  [4, 5] . Other species specialized on fruit crops such as Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) and Bactrocera zonata (Saunders) have been reported on vegetable crops, but do not cause significant damage in Reunion Island (S.  Quilici, pers. comm.) . Bactrocera cucurbitae, the melon fly, has been relatively recently introduced into Reunion (identified in 1972), probably from India via Mauritius  [3] . Its current distribution ranges from South Asia, whence it originates, to many Pacific Islands (including Hawaii) and, more recently, the Seychelles and Africa, where it is currently spreading  [6] . Its biology is relatively well known, and the species has been much studied in India, South-East Asia and Hawaii  [7] . It is a thermophilic species not commonly found at altitudes over 800 m in Reunion. Dacus ciliatus, the Ethiopian cucurbit fly, was probably introduced from Africa whence it originated. It has been reported in Reunion since 1964  [4] . It is also present in most of the South-West Indian Ocean islands, but also in India and South-East Asia  [8] . It has been much less studied than the species above. It is a eurythermal species, since it has been found in Reunion from the shore to high-altitude areas (at least 1200 m). Dacus demmerezi, the Indian Ocean cucurbit fly, is a more stenothermal species, probably originating from the Madagascan plateau. It was first reported in Reunion in 1972  [3] ; it is also present in Mauritius. Due to its limited distribution, the species has been very little studied, although this species causes sometimes major damage in high-altitude areas of Reunion Island (above 600 m). As such, it is considered to be a secondary damaging species in Mauritius, a low-altitude island (P.  Sookar, pers. comm.) . Each of these three species may potentially cause entire destruction of the crop, although generally two species are found coexisting in the same location, according to the altitude and season. Relatively mild attacks have been registered on certain zucchini, cucumber and melon cultivars  [4] . The tomato fruit fly, Neoceratitis cyanescens, has been described in Madagascar, where it is probably indigenous. It is not considered as a major pest there, though we have been unable as yet to explain this observation. The species was introduced into Reunion and then into Mauritius, where the first damage was reported in 1951 and 1958, respectively  [9] . Its presence in Mayotte (Comoro Archipelago) was only reported in 1992  [4] , while it was present a long time before this first mention. In Reunion Island, the distribution area of the tomato fly extends from the coast to an altitude of 1500 m, according to the availability of host plants  [3] . We observed that there are no flies present at altitude during the cool season but no study has been conducted to test diapause, quiescence or migration hypotheses. 
 Biology and behavior A few studies on the biology and behavior of these insects were conducted in Reunion Island in the late 1990s. We summarized the main biological characteristics of the four species mentioned  (table I) . The tomato fruit fly, Neoceratitis cyanescens, is one of the main pests of solanaceous crops, on which it stings young fruits to lay its eggs. This species is specialized on the Solanaceae family, represented by around twenty species in Reunion, but only eight are considered as host plants  [10] . It causes significant damage to field-grown tomato and, to a lesser extent, to the sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), eggplant (Solanum melongena L.), tree tomato [Cyphomandra betacea (Cav.)] and chilli pepper (Capsicum frutescens L.). Other wild or sub-indigenous Solanaceae such as the black nightshade (Solanum americanum Mill.), bug weed (S. mauritianum Scop.) and turkey berry (S. torvum Sw.) serve as breeding reservoirs. The wide distribution of these host plants on the island up to an altitude of 1500 m, as well as abundant, nearly uninterrupted fruit bearing, offer suitable conditions for the development of tomato fruit flies all year round  [11] . Mating starts from the second day after emergence of the adults. At 25°C, the females mate very frequently, about three out of four days  [12] . The pre-oviposition period lasts from 4 to 6 days. Larval development in the fruit lasts from 10 to 15 days  [13] . Upon maturing, the larvae burst out of the fruit, and then pupate in the soil. As pupation lasts around ten days, the development cycle from egg to adult takes 21 to 31 days  [9, 13, 14] . In response to odors released by host plants, and carried by the wind, the tomato fly females are guided to the source by successive flights  [5] . After arriving at the host habitat, visual stimulation alone is sufficient to guide their landing onto the fruit  [15] . Females respond strongly to a bright orange-colored sphere, which probably mimics the host fruit  [15, 16] . However, the incorporation of appropriate olfactory signals enhances their search efficiency  [17] . The response to stimuli is affected by the nature and structure of the habitat  [17] . The response of females to a host fruit type visual signal depends on their age and their egg load, but also their nutritional condition  [15] . This response is at its greatest in the afternoon, the preferred period for ovipositing  [18] . Bactrocera cucurbitae, Datus ciliatus and D. demmerezi are three oligophagous species specialized mainly on the Cucurbitaceae family, the first two developing on 16 species and the latter on 13 species  [4] . Of these 16 species, four are wild Cucurbitaceae -Coccinia grandis (L.) Voigt, Momordica charantia L., Cucumis anguria L. and Lagenaria sphaerica (Sonder) Naudinwhich act as reservoir plants, enabling above all the reproduction of B. cucurbitae and D. ciliatus all year round, primarily on the shore with the driest wind  [4] . These two species are polyvoltine at low altitude. In Reunion Island, besides Cucurbitaceae, we can report rare attacks on the tomato, wild passion fruit (Passiflora foetida L.) and passion fruit (Passiflora edulis Sims)  [4] . We noted that B. cucurbitae attacks the tomato and papaya little or not at all (Carica papaya L.) in this island, whereas it causes damage to these crops in other parts: India  [19] , Cameroon  [20] , Hawaii  [21]  and Benin  [6] . This probably results from competition for resources with N. cyanescens for the tomato, and with various fruit fly species (Ceratitis spp.) that might develop on the P. Ryckewaert et al. papaya in Reunion. It could also involve a special biotype of this species, but this aspect has not been investigated. The fruit of cultivated species is attacked by females of the three species within around ten days of fruit setting and sometimes even before the ovary has been fertilized, as it is often the case with the pumpkin and zucchini. Hence these fruits are generally punctured two days before fruit setting, the fruits of the watermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.)] are punctured two to six days after, and the fruits of the cucumber are punctured four to ten days after  [22] . These three Dacini species may lay their eggs in either the vegetative part of the plant (stems) or in the floral organs (male and female flowers). These two biological characteristics relating to egg-laying may partly explain why some farmers do not identify the damage caused by these pests  [4] . Furthermore, the extensive cropping systems (picking type) which are quite frequently encountered are a factor favoring development of Tephritidae populations because of (i) the absence of cropping and control practices, and (ii) the presence of ""reservoir plants"" through the absence of human intervention. Study of demographic parameters of D. ciliatus showed a high biotic potential, which could partly explain its wide geographic distribution in Asia and Africa  [23] , just like B. cucurbitae  [24] . Experiments on the behavior of D. ciliatus showed that the orange color was significantly more attractive to sexually mature females, and that the yellow color was significantly more attractive to sexually mature males  [25] . These responses of D. ciliatus to visual stimuli could be used to improve trapping of this species as part of biotechnical control, as could the investigation of chemical stimuli. The spatio-temporal distribution of these insects depends both on biotic factors (specific bio-ecological characteristics, host fruit availability, presence of other competing species, etc.) and abiotic factors (temperature, humidity, wind, etc.). Populations are particularly high during the southern summer (December to March) both in terms of spatial distribution and density. Consequently, their economic impact on crops is considerable during this period. 
 Population control methods used in Reunion Island In Reunion Island, control of fruit flies is still largely based on the use of insecticides. Research issues have gradually turned towards alternative methods, taking inspiration from work already conducted on orchard fruit flies in the island, or on vegetable fruit flies worldwide. We summarized the various methods currently used against these flies in Reunion Island (table II). 
 Chemical control Until now, farmers have applied foliar insecticides directly onto plots in order to control either adults present in the crop directly via contact or inhalation, or adults arriving at the plot subsequently via a residual or repellent effect. Overall, farmers have reported the effectiveness of these sprayings, although they have not been proved by field experiments in the island. These applications have no effect on larvae survival, which are protected inside the fruits. Laboratory studies have demonstrated the efficacy of several active ingredients on imagoes  [26, 27] , but transposing this to the field did not necessarily give the same results. The frequent and repeated use of various insecticides belonging to three main chemical families (organophosphates, carbamates and pyrethroids), has perhaps led to resistance, which could partly explain the increase in damage observed over the past few years, but no studies have been conducted on this issue in Reunion. Furthermore, these insecticide sprayings probably reduce populations of natural enemies (predators, parasitoids, etc.), as a natural pest control. Observations of daytime activities of some fruit fly species demonstrated that only females entered the plot to lay eggs, whereas males or immature females remained located in the immediate surroundings of fields (e.g., hedges) to feed, mate or rest  [4, 5] . Hence treatments applied to the field will at best only affect part of the adult population. 
 Preventive measures (sanitation) Unsellable fruits, especially those housing larvae, left on the ground or on plants, are P. Ryckewaert et al. a major reservoir for the next generation  [28] . Elimination of these fruits should be systematic so as to reduce subsequent infestations. It is also recommended to destroy crop residues after harvest. However, these principles are still little implemented by farmers in Reunion, above all for issues of custom and labor costs. The absence of host plants (cultivated or not) during a period in principle offers little benefit on a single farm in view of the flies' high mobility capacities and their lifetime of several months. However, these periods exist at high altitude during the Southern winter (June to September), but we soon observe recolonization of the crops when the temperature increases, although we cannot say whether these are overwintering populations (very likely for D. demmerezi in view of its distribution primarily at high altitude), or migrants from lower altitude. Eliminating uncultivated host plants around the edges of plots, such as the wild bitter melon, does not seem to have much effect on infestation. Indeed, most Cucurbitaceous plots located in areas where they are not normally grown (big sugar cane cropping regions) but with bitter melons (Mormodica charantia) present around the edges, have always had very little infestation (pers. obs.). It would also seem that the permanent presence of suitable crops in a production area maintains the high population levels observed. For the tomato fruit fly, the importance of bug weed (Solanum mauritianum) as a source of infestation needs to be studied. Conversely, these indigenous plants may have a positive role, acting as auxiliary reservoirs (banker plants). Trials conducted in Hawaii demonstrated that implementing preventive measures in a production region reduced populations on their own by over 60% (E. Harris, pers. commun.), which emphasizes the usefulness of these practices on the scale of a whole production area, rather than on a single plot or farm. 
 Physical control Mechanical protection of crops via nets or screens to prevent insect egg-laying is a solution already employed on some crops such as cabbage  [29] , and could be a way forward against flies. However, using agrotextile nets has often proven problematic under tropical conditions due to the plant being subjected to big temperature and humidity rises, causing poor plant development or development of diseases (pers. obs.). Furthermore, these nets prevent flower pollination, which is essential in most Cucurbitaceous plants, especially as fruit fly egglaying starts even before the female flowers open  [4] . Finally, the cost of these nets remains prohibitive in Reunion Island, as well as the labor required to handle them. However, mini-tunnel systems communicating with hives have been tested with success in Senegal  [30, 31] . Practices of individual fruit bagging using nets are sometimes employed in some countries with low labor costs  [32] . In Guinea, straw protection of very young pumpkin and zucchini fruits has yielded beneficial results, significantly reducing infestations (J.-F. Vayssières, pers. obs.). Although no studies have been conducted to date on this aspect, the behavior of N. cyanescens may be affected by the transparent plastic film, as it modifies the light spectrum  [33] . This phenomenon is already known for other insects in greenhouses, where UV filtering through certain plastic films impairs movement or egg-laying  [34] . 
 Observations, followed by a trial by the 
 Biotechnical control Biotechnical control is defined as the use of stimuli or visual and chemical agents that P.  Ryckewaert et al.  affect the behavior or development of the target insect  [35] . This involves using techniques that will act on the insects' behavior via visual or olfactory stimuli, and guide them to an attractive source, trapping or killing them, thereby enabling a count (monitoring) or elimination (mass trapping). Improving biotechnical control must be based on better knowledge of the bio-ecology and behavior of the species. 
 Colored traps It has long been known that fruit flies are attracted by the color yellow. It is possible to use panels of this color, or bottles of oil covered with glue, and set them up within or around the crops (a traditional method used by some farmers in Reunion Island). Tests have been conducted on chayote [Sechium edule (Jacq.)], a cucurbit crop locally grown on vines, which demonstrated better attractiveness with yellow bottles put under the vine than those above it. Other more specific colors, as well as the shape of the glue-coated traps, have been tested  [4, 5, 16, 17] . These types of visual traps, intended rather for tracking the development of populations, are not very practical as besides the drawbacks due to the glue we have found a lack of selectivity in the yellow traps, as many predator and pollinator insect species are also attracted. In addition, we have not observed a significant population or damage decrease by setting traps in a single plot in our trials. 
 Male Annihilation Technique (MAT) A few chemical substances, known as parapheromones, have the property of strongly attracting the males of some fruit fly species in the same way as sexual pheromones. Consequently, these products can be used in trapping systems. Several types of traps, based on the ""Tephritrap ® "" used in fruit orchards, have been tested locally. These were most often dry traps containing a parapheromone-soaked capsule or plate, with an added vapor action insecticide (dichlorvos, malathion). Two vegetable fruit fly species present in Reunion, B. cucurbitae and D. demmerezi, are attracted by a known parapheromone, the cuelure. Comparative tests have been conducted with various diffusers: the one supplied locally by the FDGDON, comprising a wooden cube impregnated with cuelure and malathion, currently appears to be the most useful in terms of effectiveness, cost and availability in Reunion. As malathion in the long term may be withdrawn from the market, other active ingredients such as spinosad could replace it  [36] . In vegetable producing areas, these traps can capture a very high number of males (sometimes hundreds per trap per week), which reflects the high population levels. However, this method cannot significantly reduce populations and damage when the traps are set up inside or around a single plot as the adults probably move to an entire area (reinfestation via migrations). In addition, uncaptured males are capable of fertilizing a number of females (polygyny), and the females also have the ability to live for several months. Hence this method used alone may be insufficient  [37] . This constraint has also been observed with the use of sexual pheromones  [38]  which may, on the other hand, give good results as, for example, with forest moths such as Lymantria dispar (L.)  [39] , provided that the populations are low density and the infested area isolated. Therefore, it would be necessary to apply a combined control method to an entire production area. A campaign against flies attacking chayote was conducted by the FDGDON using cuelure traps in an isolated production area located at an average altitude of 400 m in the South of the island. After several months of trapping, the quantity of trapped B. cucurbitae males had greatly decreased as D. demmerezi was barely present at this altitude. However, fruit damage did not decrease and the rearing of larvae taken from the fruit primarily produced D. ciliatus, a species not attracted by cuelure. Hence, generalized trapping led to the replacement of an initially dominant species by another less competitive species. 
 Bait Application Technique (BAT) Fruit flies need water, carbohydrates and proteins to ensure their survival, but also for egg maturation. The foraging behavior for these nutrients can be exploited by attracting the flies with products providing them with these substances. Numerous products containing proteins or yeasts, or even plant-derived substances, have been used as attractants worldwide  [40] [41] [42] [43] [44]  used either in traps or mixed with an insecticide for spot treatments on crops. These attractants can be used with two methods. First, McPhail-type liquid traps are used, in which the flies are attracted and drowned. Yet this device attracts few individuals compared to the parapheromone traps and so remains insufficient for significantly reducing populations, although the specificity is lower and the attraction applies to both sexes. Furthermore, there do not always seem to be correlations between the number of individuals trapped and the level of damage, but we have a lack of data. Nonetheless, these traps are good indicators of the species presence and their changes over time. Spot sprayings, long since successfully used in fruit orchards  [45] , consist of applying to some plants or plant parts a food attractant acting as a lure, mixed with an insecticide. Several protein or yeast-based food attractants were tested in large outdoor cages with laboratory-reared flies. This type of attractant was tested in liquid form in McPhail-type traps. The products tested (Nulure ® , Solbait ® , Hymlure ® , Corn Steep water ® , Pinnacle ® , Torula ® and various yeasts including brewing waste derivatives) were all more effective than the Buminal ® control, the only food attractant for fruit flies sold in France  [46, 47] . However, authorization for their use is classified as minor usage in Reunion, which has not yet been defined, and they cannot yet be put on the market. Improvements in effectiveness by reducing the pH or increasing the concentration have also been observed to a certain degree, but using additives (borax, ammonium acetate) or using enzymes (papain) had no positive effect  [48, 49] , unlike the findings with other fruit fly species. Though the methodology has been gradually refined to eliminate some biases  [50] , we have not tested the effectiveness or repellent effect of only a few insecticides intended for mixing with attractants. These experiments in field cages are, however, fairly remote from the reality of spot treatments, where small quantities of products are applied to the leaves in the form of drops, which will dry more or less quickly. Hence a new protocol for comparative tests in large cages has been proposed using dry traps containing an insecticide plate, a piece of maize leaf mounted on a wet piece of cotton, onto which a drop of a given volume of attractant is placed. The results proved to be contradictory depending on the replicates. Trials have started to this end to explain the variability of the responses observed, which appears to be related to the position of the traps in the cage relative to the sun, the time of fly activity, the temperature and the attraction by the maize leaf, wet piece of cotton and yellow color of the insecticide plate. Field tests conducted in collaboration with several local partners (FDGDON, Plant Protection Service) provided an opportunity for testing a new product, GF 120 (= SYNEIS APPAT ® ), a mixture of a food attractant and a natural insecticide, spinosad), applied in spot spraying to the crop or border plants favorable to flies, such as maize. Indeed, studies in Reunion into fly behavior have demonstrated that the applications would gain effectiveness if applied around the edges of the plot  [18] , as it is done in West Africa  [6] . These tests have not, however, demonstrated the effectiveness of GF 120 under the conditions of Reunion, even if the doses, concentrations or application frequency are increased, whereas it appears to be effective in other parts of the world  [51] . Laboratory tests have confirmed its toxicity against several fly species  [52]  and we have observed it for ourselves in large outdoor cages, as in Mauritius  [53] . Furthermore, studies on B. cucurbitae have demonstrated that the age of the flies, exposure time and product concentration had an effect on attractiveness and mortality  [54] . A hypothesis may be drawn up regarding this lack of effectiveness in the field. As flies are highly mobile insects, it is highly likely that they are constantly arriving from surrounding host crops, where populations may be high. Furthermore, we do not know the remanence of attractants, and their rapid P.  Ryckewaert et al.  breakdown could also explain the phenomenon. It is also possible that the females have time to lay even before being eliminated by spot sprayings. However, according to manufacturer sources, GF 120 would be effective in fruit crops when applied to hundreds of hectares of single crop land, in an environment with few natural areas or little wild land. This situation is therefore different to that in Reunion where vegetable crop plots are piecemeal, and surrounded by a variety of habitats. Furthermore, tests conducted in Reunion  [50]  and the USA  [55]  have demonstrated that flies with protein-sufficient diets are much less attracted by attractants containing protein, such as GF 120, for example. Hence it is highly possible that flies can easily find protein sources in a local context rich in food resources (plant exudates, excrement, maize pollen, fruits, etc.). 
 Biological control Fruit flies have a number of natural enemies, which generally attack the eggs or larvae. However, these stages are more or less protected by the fruits hosting them, except when the larvae emerge from the fruit to pupate in the soil. They can then fall prey to various predators (including ants) and parasitoids. The eggs inserted under the fruit skin can also be parasited fairly easily by oophagous species, whereas only larvae near the edges of the fruit can be reached by other parasitoids. Adults may also be captured by various organisms (spiders, for example), but this aspect has still been little studied. Several entomophagous species have been listed across the world, but their effectiveness is not always sufficient in economic terms. Only a few species are recognized as beneficial and have been introduced to various countries, and some of them to Reunion in the past few years, but not all are acclimated or are still at too low a level to have a useful action  [56] . Psyttalia fletcheri (Silvestri) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is the most used parasitoid worldwide for controlling B. cucurbitae  [57] . Its introduction into Reunion in 1995 and its installation have been a success  [58] , but the level of parasitism observed in the past few years is still low in crops (< 5%), including on plots without insecticides  [4] . However, it is possible that the levels obtained from larvae in the fruit underestimate the real parasitism rate because some larvae could be parasited when they emerge from the fruit before pupation in the soil. Furthermore, we have not studied the effectiveness of this parasitoid against D. demmerezi and D. ciliatus, although it is known that this hymenopterous insect can parasite them in the laboratory  [56] . The main P. fletcheri reservoir in Reunion appears to be the wild bitter melon (Mormodica charantia), which primarily hosts B. cucurbitae  [4] . On the other hand, the effectiveness of this species has been demonstrated in Hawaii provided that pre-reared individuals are released in mass (over 60,000 individuals·ha -1 per week)  [59] , which poses the problem of cost. A complementary technique aimed at increasing parasitoid populations consists of putting sting fruits in a cage (with larvae therefore partly parasited), the mesh of which enables emergent parasitoids to escape but prevents the flies from passing through. This technique used in Hawaii is known as the ""augmentorium"" (E. Harris, pers. commun.). A fruit fly egg parasitoid, Fopius arisanus (Sonan) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), has been recently imported to the island to control Bactrocera zonata, but a study has demonstrated that it cannot complete its cycle on B. cucurbitae and that it develops little on the three other species concerned  [60] . In the cases of D. ciliatus, D. demmerezi and N. cyanescens, the parasitoids are much less known, and further research would need to be conducted in their areas of origin, which are assumed to be in Africa and Madagascar. Some parasitoid species have been recently mentioned on D. ciliatus in Egypt  [61] . In Reunion, very little data exists on parasitoids of N. cyanescens: the ones mentioned are Psyttalia near distinguenda (Granger) and Ps. insignipennis (Granger), but this parasitism seems to be occasional  [5] . 
 Other control methods not used in Reunion 
 Integrated Pest Management Integrated Pest Management (IPM), developed since the 1970s in the Northern countries, has generally aimed to harmonize organic control with rational chemical control in a curative approach, with rather disappointing results in most situations  [62] . Furthermore, there are no insecticides specific to fruit flies. Hence, as with other pests, fly control has until now been almost exclusively based on chemicals, where the insecticides used may subsequently end up on the fruits, in the soil and in the water tables, not to mention the adverse effects on useful fauna (entomophagous species, pollinators, etc.). For example, an experimental tomato plot managed without chemical sprayings in the South of the island exhibited major fruit damage due half to N. cyanescens and half to tomato fruitworm noctuid moth Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner), which does not normally cause damage in Reunion, probably controlled by broad-spectrum treatments applied against N. cyanescens. Finally, we need to take into account all of the pests of the crops concerned, since their overall management may be difficult in some cases following the cessation of broad-spectrum insecticide applications. 
 Sterile Insect Technique Also known as genetic control, the principle of the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) consists of releasing very great quantities of males pre-sterilized by ionizing rays. They then compete with the wild males and mate with the females, which will lay sterile eggs. This method, which may form part of IPM, does, however, assume that the sterile males are much greater in number than the wild males and that their fitness for mating is unaltered. This technique has completely eradicated species such as B. cucurbitae on some Pacific islands  [63, 64] . However, it poses several drawbacks, particularly in the context of Reunion. Firstly, the mass rearing of millions of individuals would need to be controlled over several years, which presupposes setting up a production factory. In the case of flies attacking vegetables in Reunion, the techniques and experience are known for just one species, B. cucurbitae, and it would be necessary to launch studies to develop large-scale rearing of three other species, especially since mass rearing of N. cyanescens and above all of D. ciliatus has always been problematic in the laboratory. There is also the added problem of the females' mating capacity throughout their lifetime with several males: for example, the N. cyanescens females mate nearly every day  [5] . Moreover, following eradication of some species in other lands, species displacement phenomena through elimination of the competition have been observed  [65] . Consequently, SIT should be applied simultaneously to the three species present on Cucurbitaceae in Reunion. Hence, for economic reasons and due to the relatively small crop surface areas concerned, it appears unlikely that this method will be implemented. It could possibly be profitable at a regional level, but not all lands are affected by the same species. 
 Prospects for implementing agro-ecological management of vegetable fruit flies in Reunion 
 Approach and references The structure of landscape as a mosaic of habitats affects the spatio-temporal dynamic of insect populations. Landscape management may contribute to maintaining insect populations at non-harmful levels, by promoting faunistic balances and preserving biodiversity. This approach is based on agro-ecological pest management  [66]  and can be applied in particular in the form of management of their habitats or those of their natural enemies and of pollinators on expanded time, space and management scales  [67] . Enhancement of beneficial fauna may be achieved through increasing plant diversity, whether cultivated (rotations, mosaics, intercropping, etc.) or uncultivated (borders, hedges, fallows, natural environments, etc.). This biodiversity also ensures better resilience of agro-systems  [68] . 
 P. Ryckewaert et al. Planting service plants around plots has several objectives depending on the species: a trap or repellent effect for pests (""push-pull""), or acting as a reservoir for beneficials (functional biodiversity). Regarding trap plants, the initial observations seem to indicate that the wild bitter melon (Mormodica charantia) is more attractive to B. cucurbitae females than the zucchini, which therefore appears to be protected, but the opposite clearly applies to D. ciliatus. Similarly, with traps placed in large field cages, we have found that bitter melon leaves were clearly more attractive to B. cucurbitae females than the same weight of zucchini leaves. The importance of this sub-indigenous plant as a parasitoid reservoir, however, is still limited as levels of parasitism remain low (< 10%) (P.  Ryckewaert, unpublished) . Observations have shown that vegetable fruit flies could gather on certain field border plants on which they feed  [69] , mate  [4]  and rest  [18] . Hence grasses such as maize, sorghum or sugar cane often act as shelter plants for these flies. Maize seems particularly favorable to these insects, which probably find water, exudates and pollen  [4, 70] , or even aphid honeydew or other nutrients. Therefore, it appears more logical to place traps or apply spot treatments to this type of plant rather than to the crop  [51, 71, 72] . Finally, these plants may also promote development of beneficials, or host them. The approach initiated in Reunion is consistent with the agro-ecological approach described above, the conceptual bases of which were summarized by Deguine et al.  [73] . It is also completely consistent with the guidelines adopted in some countries for vegetable fruit fly control based on a largescale management approach (Area-Wide Pest Management)  [74] . In Hawaii, a program of this type was initiated in 2000 on several hundred hectares, on several crops (cucurbits, papayas, etc.) and on several fruit fly species including B. cucurbitae, a species present in Reunion  [75] . Besides the fact that Hawaii and Reunion exhibit numerous similarities, particularly in terms of agriculture and climate, the situation on this island in 2008 may be compared to that of Hawaii in 2000: significant fruit and vegeta-ble fly damage in horticultural systems; a certain skepticism on the part of some protagonists, primarily the farmers, already disappointed by previous proposals; a common, shared and conscious desire on the part of stakeholders in the project  [76] . Seven years of findings are now available to evaluate its effectiveness, both in technical terms  [72, 77, 78]  and economic terms  [79] . Four years after its initiation, the profits generated exceeded the annual costs of its application. This program is currently considered in the United States as a model for success in IPM, and one of the keys to this success is due to the efficient coordination between the different protagonists in the program  [80] . Furthermore, it has been subject to adaptations that have been successful in other countries, such as Japan  [81]  and Taiwan  [82] . Other initiatives are being launched based on this model, such as on Mauritius, with the support of the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
 Research actions implemented in fly bio-ecology Among the research actions to be developed, those relating to acquisition of knowledge of fly bio-ecology are the first to intensify. While B. cucurbitae is a fly whose biology has been well studied in the world, the same does not apply to the three other species found in Reunion (D. ciliatus, D. demmerezi and N. cyanescens). The aim of the studies should be to establish the main bioecological characteristics of these flies, and will cover the circadian rhythm, particularly the flies' movements between cultivated plants (Cucurbitaceae, Solanaceae) and uncultivated plants (primarily borders). Similarly, studies into the main natural enemies need to be conducted, both on predators (ants, ground beetles, rove beetles) and on parasitoids (including Psyttalia fletcheri). Tri-trophic interactions (pests, natural enemies, plants) will be a key object for study in this approach. 
 Research actions into genetic structure of populations A work program is being initiated at the International Center for Agricultural Research for Development (CIRAD, Reunion) to analyze via micro-satellite markers the genetic variability of vegetable fruit fly populations, by the following parameters: host plants (wild vs. cultivated), altitude gradient [(0 to 1200) m] and seasonal temperatures (winter-summer). This work will enable one to specify the importance of reservoir plants and shelter plants in the reproduction of fruit flies, and gain a better knowledge of dispersal, seasonal migration and practical details of the winter season transition. The year 2008 was devoted to starting sampling on 25 sites (B. cucurbitae and D. demmerezi), tool construction (D. demmerezi, D. ciliatus and N. cyanescens) and developing DNA extraction. The program will continue these preliminary activities on the four fly species concerned. 
 Design of an agro-ecological management scheme for vegetable fruit flies Thereafter, it will be a matter of developing and evaluating a technical management package for fly populations, based on an agro-ecological approach. The design of this package is based on existing foreign experience, especially from Hawaii, while taking into account the particularities of Reunion (socio-economic characteristics of agriculture, biological characteristics of the flies present, etc.). The technical consistency of this package is an essential preliminary step. The foundation of the package is based on the following techniques: monitoring, trap plants and using new products (assisted push-pull), the Male Annihilation Technique (MAT), biological control and agro-ecological practices. 
 Conclusions The control methods tested hitherto in Reunion against vegetable fruit flies have proven to be greatly insufficient in limiting damage to the crops concerned. The absence of parapheromones for all species, genuinely effective food attractants which are approved and have sufficiently longlasting action, the existence of short crop cycles repeated all year round without nohost plant zones, the ability of the flies to live for several months and move around easily, the presence of high population levels probably resulting from an imbalance, the presence of scattered plots, and the difficulty in implementing preventive measures may explain the failures observed up until now. Fly population control should be implemented at production area level, with collective and coordinated resources, to promote a new agro-ecological balance centered on the role of functional plants, habitat management and development of natural beneficials, on a landscape scale. Other alternative methods (MAT, BAT, etc.) may be used as complements. These environmentally friendly techniques can therefore be included under Organic Agriculture and IPM approaches. P. Ryckewaert et al. 
 Las moscas de las frutas (Diptera: Tephritidae) en verduras en la Reunión (océano Índico): estado de los conocimientos, métodos de control y perspectivas de gestión. Resumen --Importancia de las moscas de las frutas en cultivos de hortalizas. Los cultivos de hortalizas ocupan una posición determinante en la producción agrícola en la Reunión (océano Índico). No obstante, existen numerosas plagas así como enfermedades, que suponen una amenaza para la rentabilidad de este sector agrícola. Las moscas de las frutas (Diptera: Tephritidae) se clasifican entre las plagas principales de las solanáceas y de las cucurbitáceas (pepino, calabacín, melón, etc.). Se observaron frecuentemente pérdidas de cerca del 80 % de las cosechas de tomate y del 100 % de cucurbitáceas. Inventario y distribución. Cuatro especies de moscas de las frutas pertenecientes a la familia de los Tephritidae provocan importantes daños en los cultivos de verduras en la Reunión: Bactrocera cucurbitae (Coquillet), Dacus ciliatus Loew y D. demmerezi (Bezzi) en los cucurbitáceos, y Neoceratitis cyanescens (Bezzi) en las solanáceas (principalmente los tomates). La distribución de cada uno de ellos está presentada. Biología y comportamiento. En la Reunión en los años 1990 se realizaron ciertos estudios sobre la biología así como sobre el comportamiento de las cuatro moscas de las frutas. Se resumieron sus principales características biológicas. Métodos de control de las poblaciones empleadas en la Reunión. Se exponen diversos métodos empleados actualmente en la Reunión contra estas moscas de las frutas: lucha química, medidas preventivas (saneamiento), control físico, control biotécnico [color de las trampas, técnica de anihilación del macho (MAT), así como técnica de empleo de cebos (BAT)], y lucha biológica. En la Reunión no se emplean otros métodos de lucha como la lucha antiparasitaria integrada o la técnica del insecto estéril. Perspectivas de puesta en marcha de la gestión agro-ecológica de las moscas de las frutas en cultivo de hortaliza en la Reunión. Esta parte presenta tanto las acciones de investigación puestas en marcha en bio-ecología de la mosca, como las acciones de investigación en la estructura genética de las poblaciones, o incluso la concepción de un sistema de gestión agro-ecológico para las moscas de las frutas de las verduras. Conclusiones. Los métodos empleados independientemente unos de otros no demostraron su eficacia para el control de las poblaciones de las Tephritidae. Se necesita un acercamiento más íntegro, que tome en cuenta la escala del paisaje y de su mosaico de hábitats, en concreto las plantas espontáneas, cuyo papel debe considerarse en el marco de una gestión agro-ecológica de las poblaciones de estas plagas. Fédération Départementale des Groupements de Défense contre les Organismes Nuisibles (FDGDON, St Paul, La Reunion), demonstrated that cucurbit flies do not enter open plastic tunnels housing cucumber crops, the openings of which are closed off by bird nets (mesh size around 3 cm, black). The phenomenon has not currently been explained; the net may disrupt the flight behavior of the flies, preventing them from entering in spite of the large mesh size. Another case concerns open tomato crop shelters (without nets over the openings) with which all farmers observed very little tomato fly damage, although major attacks can be observed on neighboring open field crops.

Martin (1999)  found that in situ germination may cause more susceptibility to aflatoxin contamination in seeds thus, reducing the seed quality. The species A. hypogaea L. has been divided into two subspecies: A. hypogaea subsp. hypogaea and A. hypogaea subsp. fastigiata. In the subspecies A. hypogaea subsp. hypogaea var. hypogaea (Virginia and Runner market types) and var. hursita, varieties have long duration cycle and seeds are dormant. While in subspecies fastigiata involving var. fastigiata (Valencia market class) and var. vulgaris (Spanish market type), varieties are early-maturing but generally lack fresh seed dormancy  (Krapovickas and Gregory, 1994) . Spanish and Valencia varieties are currently the most commonly cultivated peanut varieties in dry areas, particularly in Africa and Asia where the shortening of the rainy season is a paramount constraint. However, these early-maturing varieties lack generally fresh seed dormancy and are prone to in situ germination. The growing trend of areas occupied by early-maturing varieties will still increase during the next coming decades since drought is now a worldwide abiotic constraint for peanut production. There is a need to develop short duration peanut varieties having fresh seed dormancy to prevent yield losses due to field sprouting in unpredictable rainfall environments. During the last decade, a few studies on the inheritance of fresh seed dormancy among Spanish type varieties were carried out. Depending on whether epistasis was detected or not in inheritance of the trait, breeders suggested different strategies of selection. In fact, the conclusions of these investigations were not consistent.  Khalfaoui (1991)  indicated that duplicated epistasis controls fresh seed dormancy.  Nautiyal et al. (1994)  found that the trait is quantitatively inherited; whereas  Kumar (1999)  has reported that the trait is under additivedominance control.  Upadhyaya and Nigam (1999)  studied different populations from many crosses and found that seed dormancy in that peanut-type is controlled by a single gene and dormancy allele is dominant. More recently,  Ndoye (2001)  studied three crosses between Spanish varieties and reported that beyond additive and dominance effects, there is duplicate epistasis in the control of fresh seed dormancy. Phenotyping for fresh seed dormancy in peanut can be reliably carried out at the field  (Khalfaoui, 1991)  or in vitro assay  (Upadhyaya and Nigam, 1999; Asibuo et al., 2008) . Our previous work gives strong evidence that field test and in vitro assay give similar results for fresh seed dormancy  (Faye et al., 2009 ) when seed germination tests are performed under right convenience of humidity, light and appropriated temperatures. Breeding for new varieties requires development and evaluation of a cross progeny. In self-pollinated crops (for example, cowpea, rice, cotton, common beans and groundnut), the breeding process starts commonly with hand pollination. Hybridization requires laborious manual emasculation and pollination as well as manual removing of non-crossed flowers. In groundnut, some underground uncolored flowers as fertile as external flowers may not be removed by the operator and produce undesirable self-pollinations. Therefore, distinguishing true F 1 hybrids from plants coming from inadvertent selfs is very impor-tant before deriving F 2 population and subsequent families. In groundnut, distinguishing true F 1 hybrids from inadvertent selfs may be easy to achieve base on plant morphology when dealing with crosses for which parents are much divergent. In contrast, for intrasubspecies crosses (e.g. Spanish x Spanish), true F 1 hybrids are not easily distinguishable from female parent using morphological characteristics. The purpose of this paper is to study the inheritance of fresh seed dormancy in a Spanish x Spanish cross. In this study, an F 2 population derived from true F 1 hybrids identified using microsatellite markers was compared with an F 2 , a BC 1 P 1 s and a BC 1 P 2S populations developed without conformity control of F 1 plants. 
 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 Populations' development During the spring of the year 2006, one of the most susceptible in situ germination varieties (Fleur 11) cultivated in the ""Senegalese peanut basin"" was crossed to a dormant variety (73-30). The female parent Fleur 11 is non-dormant but high-yielding specie since it is very prolific and its underground uncolored flowers are remarkably numerous. The genotype 73-30 is a dormant variety and mediumyielding. Fleur 11 and 73-30 are both early-maturing varieties; they mature at 90 days after sowing (DAS). They have no common ancestor in their pedigree. The crosses were made as suggested by  Sudheer and Kumar (1996) . At harvest, the putative F1 seeds were randomly divided into two subsets before processing to the subsequent generations. One subset was assigned to molecular screen for identifying true hybrid F1 individuals (described below) using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. In that subset, once a plant was identified as true F1 hybrid (DNA extraction and microsatellite analysis), it was allowed to self-pollinate to give controlled F2 seeds. Another subset of putative F1 seeds was used to develop backcross progeny with each of the parents that is, BC1P1 [73-30 x F1 (Fleur 11 x 73-30)] and BC1P2 [Fleur 11 x F1 (Fleur 11 x 73-30)]. These backcross progenies and the remaining non controlled F1 seeds were planted at field station (Bambey, Senegal) and allowed to self-pollinate, then selfed backcross between BC1P1S, BC1P2S populations and an F2 population, respectively. These three populations were referred to as non-controlled populations in the present paper. 
 DNA extraction A set of seventy eight (78) putative F1 plants were grown in pots filled with sandy soil along with five plants of each parent in the greenhouse at Regional Center for Studies on the Improvement of Plant Adaptation to Drought (CERAAS) near Thiès, Senegal. At 15 days after emergency, young leaves were harvested from each plant and immediately stored at 4°C in ice before DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from 100 mg of fresh leaves following a slightly modified mixed alkyl trimethylammonium bromide (MATAB) protocol  (Risterucci et al., 2000) . Briefly, leaves were ground in liquid nitrogen using a mortal and pestle and dissolved in 750 µl of MATAB buffer at 74°C. The samples were incubated for 20 min at 74°C and cooled for 5 min at room temperature. A volume of 750 µl of chloroform\isoamylalcohol (CIA) (24:1) was added to each sample and all samples were shaken gently until homogenization before centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was then harvested and the DNA precipitated with 600 µl of 2-propanol. After centrifugation, pellets were washed with 300 µl of 70% ethanol, air dried and dissolved in 500 µl of TE. 
 Microsatellite analysis Ten SSRs (PM050, TC6E01, TC1E05, AC2C05, Seq4F10, TC11A04, TC1D02, TC3E05, TC11H06 and TC2D06) polymorphic between the parents were used to identify the true hybrid individuals. The primers used for the identification of true F1 hybrids are listed in  Table 1 . For a given SSR locus, the forward primer was designed with a 5'-end M13 tail (5'-CACGACGTTGTAAAACGAC-3'). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications were performed in a MJ Research PTC-100 TM thermocycler (Waltham, MA, USA) or in an Eppendorf Mastercycler on 25 ng of DNA in a 10 µl final volume of buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mM KCl, 0.05% w/v gelatin, and 2.0 mM MgCl2) containing 0.1 µM of the M13-tailed primer, 0.1 µM of the other primer, 160 µM of dNTP, 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, USA.) and 0.1 µM of M13 primer-fluorescent dye IR700 or IR800 (MWG, Germany). The touchdown PCR programme used was as follow: initial denaturation at 95°C for 1 min; following by 10 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, Tm (+ 5°C, -0.5°C/cycle) for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min. After these cycles, an additional round of 25 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, Tm for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min and a final elongation step at 72°C for 8 min was performed. IR700 or IR800-labeled PCR products were diluted 7-fold and 5-fold respectively, subjected to electrophoresis in a 6.5% polyacrylamide gel and then sized by the IR fluorescence scanning system of the sequencer (LI-COR, USA). A plant was considered as true hybrid (H) if it has both alleles of the two parents for all ten primers tested while inadvertent selfs (S) had only the allele of the female parent  (Table 2) . 
 Phenotyping for fresh seed dormancy Maturity of the seeds was assessed by scoring for blackening of the internal inner parenchyma of the pod  (Miller and Burns, 1971) . In the field test, seeds were treated with a fungicide (Granox) prior the planting. The non-controlled F2, BC1P1S and BC1P2S populations were phenotyped along with the parents (Fleur 11 and 73-30) using the method described by  Khalfaoui (1991)  for fresh seed dormancy at the experiment field of the research station (CNRA, Bambey-Senegal) where their mother-plants were cultivated. During the germination test, day mean temperature was 27°C. The soil was kept moist by regular watering. Eighty seeds randomly sampled from each non-controlled segregating population (F2, BC1P1S and BC1P2S) and from each parental population (Fleur 11 and 73-30) were phenotyped for fresh seed dormancy. The number of seeds that germinated was counted each day. Monitoring continued until all the seeds germinated (35 DAS). Seventy-six seeds from the F2 population derived from controlled F1 plants along with one hundred (100) seeds from each of the two parents were incubated at room temperature (30°C ± 1) for fresh seed dormancy test. The test was performed in Petri dishes using filter paper moistened with distilled water. Before the test, Petri dishes were washed with sodium hypochlorite (46°). Filter papers were kept moist with distilled water until all the seeds germinated (35 DAS). Seeds that had not germinated at 15 DAS were soaked for 6 h in 2-chloroethylphosphonic acid (10 -3 M) solution. This compound is known to be effective in breaking seed dormancy and was used to confirm the viability of the dormant seeds. This product, commonly called ethereal, is readily converted to ethylene  (Ketring and Morgan, 1971 ). After treatment with ethereal, treated seeds was returned to room temperature until they germinated for scoring. Compared on the phenotype of the parents, the segregating F2 seeds were classified as dormant or non-dormant. 
 Statistical analysis The chi square ( 2 ) test was calculated to examine the goodnessof-fit between the observed and the expected ratios in all the populations at the probability p=0.05 level of significance. 
 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 The percentage of true F 1 hybrids identified with SSR markers Of the seventy eight (78) putative F 1 plants tested, thirty eight (38) were true F 1 hybrids, corresponding to a percentage of 48%.  Figure 1  set out a profile of bands for detecting true F 1 hybrids with the primer AC2C05. This percentage of true F 1 hybrids indicated most likely that inadvertent selfs were collected at harvest, although caution was taken to remove underground uncolored flowers till 60 days after emergency. The average percentage of true F 1 hybrids found in this study was lower than the percentage (60 -70%) observed by  Gomez et al. (2008) . However, percentage of true hybrids in self-pollinated crops depends on the female parent used in the cross since the number of underground flowers may vary from one cultivar to another. Furthermore, the percentage of true-hybrids depends upon the climatic conditions as described by  Kotzamanidis (2006)  who observed in peanut a lower (16%) percentage of successful crosses under low temperatures. It was however noted that inadvertent selfs could be important for one or another reason in cross progenies of peanut. 
 Segregation ratios for fresh seed dormancy in the different populations In the field test as well as in the Petri-dishes test, average day taken before germination was 5 days after sowing (DAS) for the seeds of the non-dormant parent (Fleur 11) while for the dormant parent (73-30), seeds germinated from 11 DAS to 35 DAS. This good level of dormancy of the donor parent 73-30 is a confirmatory of the investigations previously reported by  Gautreau (1984) ,  Khalfaoui (1991)  and  Ndoye (2001) . Therefore, in the heterogeneous populations studied here, seeds that germinated within 5 DAS were classified as non-dormant and those that took more days to germinate were classified as dormant. The chi square test performed on the F 2 population derived from true F 1 hybrids, assuming 3:1 (dormant: nondormant) ratio was not significant (P = 0.08), indicating that the trait is controlled by a single dominant gene  (Table 2) . These findings agreed with those previously reported by  Upadhyaya and Nigam (1999)  and  Asibuo et al. (2008) . In addition, the range of variation (2 -35 DAS) observed in this study  (Table 2)  for the dormancy duration is consistent with the observed range of variation by  Upadhyaya and Nigam (1999)  although they used different parents. The frequency distribution curve of fresh seed dormancy was bimodal, indicating that the trait can be treated in a qualitative fashion  (Figure 2) .  Figure 2  brought out clearly two statistic modes, one (at 1 -5 DAS) corresponding to the non-dormant seeds and the second (from 16 -20 DAS) to the dormant seeds. This finding corroborated with the segregation ratio that a single gene controls fresh seed dormancy in Spanish x Spanish crosses.  Mather (1949) ,  Lynch and Walsh (1998)  argued that when the frequency distribution curve of a given trait is bimodal, the trait under study is   
 Segregation of F 2 and selfed backcross (BC1P1S and BC1P2S) seeds from non-controlled F 1 plants Although the temperature varied slightly from one study to another; the range of variation for the number of days taken before germination (2 -35) in the laboratory test as well as in the field test were very similar. Consequently, seeds in segregating generations (F 2 , BC 1 P 1S and BC 1 P 2S ) were classified using the same criterion than in the controlled F 2 population. Phenotypic data from the populations (F 2 , BC 1 P 1S and BC 1 P 2S ) which were developed from non-tested F 1 individuals were also investigated  (Table 3) . For the selfed backcross BC 1 P 1S and BC 1 P 2S , the chi square test was performed assuming a 7: 1 and 3: 5 (dormant: nondormant) ratio, respectively. The chi square value was highly significant (P < 0.0001) for the F 2 and BC 1 P 1S populations in comparison to the expected ratios, but not for the BC 1 P 2S population. In the F 2 population, inadvertent selfs from the putative F 1 plants are probably the major source of the deviation from the expected ratio. The phenotypic data showed thirty nine (39) germinated seeds out of 80 seeds leading to a neat deviation from the expected ratio (3: 1). The expected ratio was most probably biased due to self inadvertent seeds among the putative F 1 self pollinated to develop that F 2 population. In the selfed backcross BC 1 P 1S population, the source of deviation could be attributed to inadvertent selfs in the F 1 as well as in the BC 1 P 1 [73-30 x F 1 (Fleur 11 x 73-30)] because the recurrent parent 73-30 was used as female parent  (Table 3) . Therefore, the source of deviation was most likely caused by the bias in the F 1 generation. Although much care was taken to remove them, abundant underground uncolored flowers observed in the female parent induced a shift in the expected ratios between dormant and non-dormant seeds. In contrast to the F 2 and BC 1 P 1S populations in the BC 1 P 2S population, the chi square test was not significant (p > 0.05); that means that actual phenotypic data fitted the expected ratio  (Table 3) . Good fit between observed and expected ratios in that population could be explained by mere chance since the sampling of putative F 1 used to develop the subsequent generations was at random. So the ratio may depend upon the percentage of self inadvertent plants collected at the harvest of the cross progeny, particularly the F 1 generation. The results of the present study revealed that deviation from the expected proportions in non-controlled populations (F 2 and BC 1 P 1S ) is most likely due to self inadvertent selfs during the populations' development. In the context of the contradictory conclusions about the inheritance of fresh seed dormancy in peanut among Spanish crosses, this may be prominently a consequence of the presence of inadvertent selfs in phenotyped populations. In our knowledge, except  Upadhyaya and Nigam (1999) , most of the few available previous reports on the inheritance of fresh seed dormancy among crosses of Spanish-type peanut (Arachis hypogaea, L.) did not mention precautions used to discard these problematic inadvertent selfs from populations under study. In fact, inadvertent selfed flowers may be one of the causes of the misleading conclusions reported on the inheritance of fresh seed dormancy among Spanish-type varieties. Beside the inadvertent selfs, various non-genetic factors such as environmental factors that have been extensively studied by  Toole et al. (1964)  and recently reviewed by Finch-Savage and Metzger (2006) could obscure the phenotyping work. However, the average to high heritabilities observed in this and other studies  (Khalfaoui, 1991; Ndoye, 2001)  indicated that environmental factors can be overcome. 
 Conclusion This study has given more evidence that fresh seed dormancy in Spanish x Spanish crosses is controlled by single dominant gene. Therefore, fresh seed dormancy in Spanish varieties is qualitative in nature. Pedigree selection from an F 2 population could be suggested to be an effective strategy to obtain peanut lines with earliness and fresh seed dormancy. The variety 73-30 could be used as donor parent in breeding programs. This work has outlined the importance of microsatellite markers for identifying true F 1 hybrids in cross progenies in self-pollinated crops. Since then, many SSR markers are now published in peanut. Future work will be the identification of SSR markers linked to the gene controlling fresh seed dormancy in Spanish-type peanut by using a bulk segregation analysis approach.

More than one thousand hoppers were collected and described according to a semiquantitative method. A typology is proposed, strictly reflecting the increase in population densities. This correctly translated the progressive evolution of a solitary state into a gregarious state, while passing through several intermediate transiens stages. According to their density, hopper populations consist of a mixture, in various proportions, of several pigment types. The gregarization threshold is estimated at 100,000 hoppers/ha.

Individuals are either of two extreme phenotypes: solitarious or gregarious  [1, 2] . This polyphenism is continuous and all the intermediate stages, transiens, congregans or dissocians, are found between the two extreme phases, depending on the direction of the transformation. Induction of phase transformation can occur at any stage of development of the locust including the larva and the imago. It can be strengthened through generations and is reflected by a suite of changes in behaviour, morphometry, color, development, fecundity, and endocrine physiology (see recent reviews in  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] ). Better understanding of locust phase polyphenism has an obvious applied potential and could lead, in the future, to nonconventional locust control measures as a substitute for the chemical insecticides in use  [5] , but increasingly challenged because of their environmental impact  [8, 9] . Currently, the precise characterization of the phases, and especially the intermediate transiens, is crucial for the effective implementation of preventive strategies against these locust pests, which require intervention as early as possible  [10] [11] [12] [13] . The transiens phase marks the first stages of the gregarization process. In the progressive development from remission periods to invasive periods, an understanding of the transiens phase can allow early detection and measurement of the degree of severity of the locust situation. In nature, behavioural changes are often the first characteristic observed as a result of a gathering of individuals caused by external causes such as wind convergence, surface restrictions related to phenomena such as floods, and resource distribution  [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . This characteristic is difficult to precisely quantify for the intermediate transiens stages. Morphometry remains the best method to estimate the degree of phase transformation of an individual or a population. Morphometric charts can be used to monitor the gregarization process over generations  [2, 3, 19] . In hoppers, only the color characteristics can be used. The coloring is one of the most obvious signs of the phase transformation in locusts  [5] . Several studies have been carried out on the nature of the pigments involved, the underlying physiological mechanisms, and the influence of environmental conditions  [2, 3, [20] [21] [22] [23] . The color characteristics of the solitarious and gregarious phases have been shown numerous times (see, Psyche e.g., Stower  [24]  for the Desert locust Schistocerca gregaria Forskål; Faure  [25, 26]  for the Red locust Nomadacris septemfasciata Serville 1838; Albrecht  [20] ,  Lecoq    [27] , Popov  [28]  for the Migratory locust Locusta migratoria L. 1758). The transiens phase remains, however, much less well documented, especially for the hoppers. Often, in the literature, the near infinite number of intermediate colors between the solitarious and the gregarious phases of these individuals is just mentioned. In the recent review by Pener and Simpson  [5]  the word transiens (or transient) appears 10 times only, when gregarious and solitarious are mentioned respectively, 560 and 440 times. Moreover, the phase transformation threshold is widely ignored. In nature, this threshold corresponds to the population density at which the interactions between individuals are large enough to allow the phase transformation process to start. It is sometimes given on the basis of an expert opinion without any results of specific observations  [29] . The very validity of this concept is sometimes questioned because it also depends on the insect development stage and on the vegetation density  [30] . This is crucial information from both an operational perspective to better manage locust preventive control and from a theoretical point of view to allow further detailed field studies on the phase transformation process determinism. The various difficulties in the characterization of transiens are particularly noted for the Red locust. In this species, despite various studies that have contributed to describing the pigmentation of the solitarious and of the gregarious stages  [25, 26, 28, [31] [32] [33] , the transiens remains poorly characterized and the phase transformation thresholds have never been established. More generally, phase polyphenism in the Red Locust is poorly understood and has rarely been proven experimentally and-in comparison to Desert and Migratory locusts-just a few papers are available for this species (see for instance  [34] [35] [36] ). The main effects of increased density on Nomadacris as revealed by laboratory work, were summarized by Uvarov a long time ago  [2] , and further research is obviously required  [5] . In practice, the information collected by the locust services on the transiens phase is often unreliable  [37] . We propose to clarify the color characteristics of the hopper individuals of this species in relation to population density. This study aims to provide a better understanding of the phase transformation thresholds and to improve the implementation of monitoring and preventive control of this species. This work was carried out in the field in Madagascar where this locust is a major crop pest. 
 Materials and Methods 
 The Red Locust. The Red locust is well known throughout central and southern Africa  [38, 39] . Some isolated populations can also be found in the lake Chad basin, the central delta of the Niger river in Mali, and the Cape Verde Islands  [40] . The species undergoes phase transformation and its outbreak areas are mainly located in the Great Lakes region of East Africa, in Tanzania, Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique  [41, 42] . Since the last great invasion of 1929-1944, which affected most African countries south of the equator, the species is controlled by an international organization, IRLCO (International Red Locust Control Organization)  [43] . Infestations are now less frequent and are mainly focused in the reproduction areas, far from the cultivated areas  [44] . Large outbreaks occurred, however, between 1994 and 1996  [42, 43, 45, 46]  and more recently in 2009  [47, 48] . In Madagascar, the Red locust is also a major pest and outbreaks are frequently observed with formation of hopper bands and swarms. No widespread invasion of the island has ever occurred as was frequently the case with the Migratory locust  [49]  whose last plague ravaged the Island between 1997 and 1999  [11] . The problem is now managed by the National Anti-Locust Centre as part of a crop protection strategy  [40, 50, 51] . In Madagascar, the lifecycle of the Red locust has only been documented for the Betioky-Sud region, where this species produces just one generation per year  [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] , as in the rest of Africa. Mating and egg laying take place in November and December, at the onset of the rainy season, which lasts until April. Females generally lay eggs twice or three times, with a clutch of 20-100 eggs for gregarious locusts and 20-195 eggs for solitarious locusts. The eggs hatch after 24-36 days of incubation. The hoppers begin to appear in December. The hopper development passes by 6 instars for the gregarious individuals (1 to 6) and 7 instars for the solitarious (numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 4a, 5, and 6 in order for the last instar to always carry the same number, the extra instar being before the reversal of the wing rudiments, between instar 4 and 5)  [34] . The hopper development period lasts almost 2 months, ranging 50-70 days and the new generation of adults appears in April. They enter diapause to survive through the dry season (April-September), in refuge zones located away from breeding areas. Important seasonal migrations of solitary populations take place between dry season refuge zones (where population densities are low) and rainy season breeding zones (where the populations concentrate and reproduce and where outbreaks are frequently observed)  [59] . Samples of hoppers were collected from this latter area, where the first manifestations of gregariousness may occur (behavioral changes in the parental adults, and behavioral, pigmentary, morphological changes etc. in the offspring). 
 Sampling and Description of Hoppers. Red locust hoppers were collected in south-western Madagascar in a vast area well-known as the breeding area of this species. The samples were taken during two successive rainy seasons from January to March in 2007 and in 2008. During the two sampling periods, we continuously (each hour) recorded the air temperature and the relative humidity in one location in the sampling area (near Betioky-Sud). Both parameters were not very variable, during one sampling period as well as from one year to another (temperatures 2007/2008: min 22, 7 • C ± 1, 4/23, 1 • C ± 1, 5; max 35, 1 • C ± 3, 1/37, 0 • C ± 4, 2; average 27, 8 • C ± 1, 7/28, 9 • C ± 2, 3; air humidity 2007/2008: min 39, 8% ± 14, 4/34, 4% ± 17, 7; max 82, 5% ± 7, 9/80, 2% ± 8, 4; average 64, 1% ± 10, 9/59, 1% ± 13, 3). The sampling sites were chosen based on the information provided by the National Anti-Locust Centre on the presence Psyche 3 of locust hoppers and their density. At each site, thirty hoppers were collected. The hopper density was evaluated by counting one hundred sample surfaces of one square meter each using a classical method commonly used by scouts from the locust centre  [60, 61] . These hopper populations were derived from migrant adults arriving in the breeding area at the start of the rainy season and whose phase status was described broadly as solitarious as shown by survey data from the National Anti-Locust Centre (3741 observations conducted on the whole of south-western Madagascar in 2006 and 2007 on the parental populations). Some populations in densities above the gregarious threshold, however, were observed (13 in all, including 4 light swarms at a density of between 160,000 and 200,000 imagos per hectare). For each hopper, the stage was determined by overall size, the size and the orientation of the wing pads, the number of eye stripes, and the color characteristics recorded using a standardized method. Only phase color (density) polyphenism and green/brown (humidity) polyphenism exist in the Red locust  [5] . The latter is relatively limited as the hoppers of the single annual generation were still developing in relatively close conditions at the heart of the rainy season in lush vegetation. The proportion of green hoppers diminished late in the rainy season  [57] . In cages, homochromy has sometimes been observed in solitarious hoppers  [26] . Regarding the phase color polyphenism, the descriptions in the literature concern essentially solitarious and gregarious individuals  [25, 26, 28, [31] [32] [33] . For the transiens phase, information is scarce and mainly concerns the transiens dissocians  [31, 33] . The characters finally selected were the background color (GC) and the degree of melanisation of the cephalic capsule (H), the degree of melanisation of the compound eyes (E) (with more or less visible stripes), background color of the pronotum (GP) and the degree of melanisation of its dorsal carina (CP) and lateral sides (LP), the degree of melanisation of the wing pads (W), and the presence and extent of a black spot on the distal part of the upper outer carina of the posterior femur (F). The latter criterion was supposed to be one of the first signs of gregariousness when the population density increases. The black abdominal maculation, difficult to quantify, was not considered. These eight criteria were recorded in the field using a semi-quantitative method (  Figure 1 ). For E, H, CP, W, LP, and F, the extent of black pigmentation was coded 0 for absence of black pigmentation, 2 for a well-marked black spot and 1 for an intermediate situation. General pigmentation was recorded as green, brown, or orange for the cephalic capsule (GC), and as green, brown, or yellow for the pronotum (GP). Each hopper was individually identified and photographed under standard conditions for later checking of the rating criteria. 
 Data Analysis. The results were analyzed using the Addinsoft XLSTAT data analysis software  (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) . The data table [hoppers × color variables] containing the value of the different variables (semi quantitative) for each of the hoppers observed was converted into a disjunctive table (each nominal variable comprises several levels and each of these levels is coded as a binary variable). The latter was subjected to a Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) to highlight the relationships between the various color variables, on the one hand, and between the hoppers on the other hand, according to their similarity  [62] . The hoppers and the variables were then classified according to their coordinates on the first factorial axes of the MCA using a hierarchical clustering method (Euclidean distance, Ward's aggregation method). A typology of the hoppers, from the most solitarious to the most gregarious, was constructed on the basis of the results of this classification. Finally, each class of hoppers was related to the population density value in which they were most frequently observed. This helped establish the phase transformation threshold, that is to say, the population levels from which one hopper class moves to another, solitarious forms to more and more gregarious forms (or more exactly, from population consisting of a mixture of different color types in varying proportions to another). 
 Results 
 Hoppers Pigmentation. A total of 1139 hoppers were collected and their color characteristics were described, respectively, 36, 129, 123, 283, 233, and 343 hoppers of 1, 2, 3, 4 (including 4a), 5, and 6 instars. These hoppers were collected in 42 localities where hopper densities were (on a very regular density gradient) less than one hopper (solitarious populations) to several hundred hoppers per square meter (gregarious hopper band) (  Figure 2 ). For densities greater than 150 hoppers/m 2 , no accurate count was possible and this class included densities ranging from 150 to several hundred hoppers per square meter. The hoppers collected from low-density populations (less than one hopper per square meter) were characteristic of the solitarious phase with a general green background coloring on all parts of the body (sometimes slightly yellowish) and a lack of black pigmentation (  Figure 3 ). The pigmentation was generally very similar in all individuals with low variability. Rare individuals with a general brown background color were sometimes observed and were regarded as solitarious individuals within the traditional framework of the green/brown polyphenism (as is the case with the Migratory locust, e.g.,). However, even if some of these individuals were found in low-density populations (<1/m 2 ), they were occasionally collected in relatively high-density populations of about 20-69 hoppers per square meter. Their status remains uncertain, but these hoppers (10 in all) represented only 0.9% of the individuals collected. As the population density increased, changes in pigmentation and pigment diversity increased. More numerous yellowish or orange areas appeared as well as melanised areas. In high-density populations (100/m 2 and more), the pigmentation was typical of the gregarious phase, which has been described by various authors: the compound eyes were completely dark and the eye stripes were invisible, the cephalic capsule is almost completely melanised, the general background color of the hopper was bright orange and a large part of the body was marked with highly developed black spots (  Figure 3 ). Between these two very contrasting solitarious and gregarious states, color changes  became more pronounced and appeared gradually in relation to density, corresponding to individuals that could generally be described as transiens  (Figure 3 ). These changes primarily concerned the femoral spot (F), the dorsal carina of the pronotum (CP), the compound eyes (E), and to a lesser extent, the cephalic capsule (H). With densities higher than 100/m 2 the melanisation was well marked for all the variables (E, CP, LP, W, F equal to 2 in almost 100% of cases). A progressive change in the background color of the pronotum (GP)-from green to yellow from low to high densities-was also recorded, as well as a change from green to orange for the background color of the cephalic capsule (GC). 
 Hoppers Typology. MCA demonstrated that the data were highly structured with the first two factorial axes totaling almost 90% of the total inertia of the cloud of points  (Figure 4 ). The plane determined by these first two axes served to underline the correlation between hopper pigmentation and hopper population density (density was introduced in the analysis as an additional variable, that was not included in the calculation of the inertia of the cloud of points, but projected on the axes). The first axis alone groups 82.4% of the inertia. On this axis, there is an opposition between the absence of melanisation and the green colors, on the one hand, and a strong melanisation and yellow and orange colors, on the other hand. This differentiated the solitarious individuals very schematically from those with gregarious characteristics. Along this axis, the hopper density classes ranged regularly from low densities on the negative side of the axis to high densities on the positive side. Axis 2 groups 5.9% of the inertia and shows an opposition between extreme color characteristics (0 and 2 for melanisation, green and orange for background color) and the intermediate values (1 for melanisation, green-orange, yellow and yellow-orange for the background color). This axis thus underlines the first demonstration of color polyphenism. Finally, axis 3 with only 2.9% of the inertia is entirely determined by individuals with a brown background. These results were valid regardless of the hopper instar. The same analysis (MCA) conducted either on older hoppers (4, 5 and 6) or on young hoppers (1, 2 and 3) led to exactly the same results as well as for tests conducted separately on data from 2007 and 2008 (results not shown). Classification of individuals according to their coordinates on the first five factorial axes provided a hopper typology to distinguish 15 types. This could be correlated with population density where the hoppers were collected. The color characteristics changed very gradually with increasing density. A regular gradient of color types existed from types 15, 8, and 13, showing the characteristics of low-density populations representing the solitarious types (especially the most abundant type 13), to types 6 and 9 that were found in populations where the density was higher than 60 hoppers/m 2 , and more generally, those where the density exceeded 150 hoppers/m 2 , and represented typically gregarious individuals. Between these two extremes, the other 9 types corresponded to intermediate situations concerning both color and density, and transiens-type hoppers (  Figure 5 ). Each hopper class was not therefore associated with a specific population density, but its frequency increased and then decreased steadily with density. Thus, class 5 was  present at low levels for densities less than 10 hoppers/m 2 , and it was more abundant in densities ranging from 20 to 30 hoppers, then steadily decreased in frequency. This type of hopper was not found at densities greater than 100 hoppers/m 2 . 
 A Simplified Typology for Operational Purposes. In order to achieve a practical classification that is easy to use as part of locust population survey operations, the 15 color types were grouped into 4 types based on the classification results and according to their percentage of presence in the different density classes. The color types  15, 14, 13, 8, and 11 , only present in low-density populations (<10/m 2 ), were grouped into a single type which gathered together, in their diversity, populations that were typically solitarious. Types 6 and 9 were virtually the only ones present in very high-density populations (>150/m 2 ) and could be regarded as representative of the gregarious populations. Types 4, 2, 5, and 7, which were very similar and predominated the medium-density populations, corresponded to solitaro-transiens populations. Finally, types 12, 3, 1, and 10, also similar, predominated the population at densities slightly greater (70-100/m 2 ) than for the previous types. These types could be grouped under the name transiens. These different types of hoppers can be distinguished easily and unambiguously on the basis of certain criteria for easy use in the field by the locust center scouts  (Table 1) . Thus, the appearance of the femoral spot signified the transition between solitarious and solitarotransiens populations. Wing-pad melanisation distinguished solitaro-transiens and transiens hoppers. Finally, maximal melanisation of all body parts signified the onset of the gregarious type. Ultimately, the criteria used could easily assign each hopper to a particular phase category, either solitarious, solitaro-transiens, transiens, or gregarious. The hopper populations consisted of a mixture of hoppers that may belong to different color types. The percentages of each category developed progressively: a high proportion of solitarious individuals were found in lower density populations and higher densities had increasing proportions of solitaro-transiens, transiens and then gregarious individuals. Solitarious, solitaro-transiens, transiens or gregarious populations could thus be classified on the basis of the dominant color types within the population. 
 Pigmentation and Population Density. Some color variables changed earlier than others to an increase in the hopper population density and could therefore be regarded as indicators of early signs of gregarization (  Table 1 ). The eye stripes were still visible in half of the hoppers collected at a density of 30-70/m 2 . The eyes were dark for most of the hoppers at a density of 70-100/m 2 . Melanisation of the cephalic capsule, which started at 10-30/m 2 , was especially marked at a density of 70-100/m 2 . The background color of the cephalic capsule was green for most of the larvae at very low densities. The red-orange color became predominant only at a density of 30-70/m 2 . Melanisation of the dorsal carina of the pronotum appeared at a density of 10-30/m 2 and half of the hoppers were strongly marked at a density Psyche  There was a possibility that environmental factors, other than population density, affected hopper coloration. For instance, temperature affects dark color patches in many acridids, especially in locusts  [21] . In our case, temperature and humidity were not very variable during the sampling periods. The same results were obtained in 2007 and 2008 whatever the ecological conditions showing that population density was more important than any other factor-in our field conditions in Madagascar-to determine the coloration of hoppers of the Red Locust, contrary to an early statement by  Lea and Webb in 1939 [64] . Our results confirmed (although only the pigmentation aspect was considered, which is just one component of phase polyphenism), that all hopper phases are present in Madagascar: the solitarious, all transiens-intermediate stages, and true gregarious hoppers were, in all respects, similar to those previously described in the literature, both in pigmentation and behavior (well-established and large, dense hopper bands of several hundred hoppers per square meter). These results therefore contradict the hypothesis by Roblot  [65]  and Roy  [66] , in force for almost half a century, according to which, as the environment is assumed to be less favorable to the Red locust in Madagascar as compared to Africa, only solitarious and transiens forms were able to exist on the island. This concept was so ingrained in the mentality, that the National Anti-Locust Centre in Madagascar deleted the term ""gregarious"" from the observation forms; only solitarious or transiens individuals were recorded. This is obviously the best way to avoid observing gregarious individuals. Our results complemented recent studies (based on morphometric measurements) showing that the gregarious phase amongst the imagos was indeed present in Madagascar from the extreme south to the extreme north of the country  [67] . A new gregarious area has moreover recently been identified following major outbreaks that occurred from 1999 to 2003 in the far north, surely as a result of intensive deforestation leading to the creation of new suitable biotopes  [67, 68] . 
 The Gregarization Threshold in Red Locust Hoppers. Our results showed that the typology of hopper populations is strictly a reflection of hopper density. The color changes marking a first phase change were noted in the hoppers found in populations where the density is 10 hoppers Psyche 9 per square meter. The first real gregarious hoppers are found, occasionally, from 60-70 hoppers/m 2 and become predominant from 150/m 2 . Thus, the gregarization threshold can be estimated at about 100,000 hoppers per hectare. To our knowledge, this is the first indication of this type in the Red locust. For adults, this threshold has been recently estimated to be around 5,000 individuals per hectare by Franc et al.  [67] . In comparison, the threshold is estimated at 2,000 adults/ha for the Migratory locust  [69] . For the Desert locust, the threshold is estimated at 250-500 hoppers per hectare and varies between 5 and 0.5 hoppers/m 2 from the first to the fifth instar  [29] . For the Red locust, the threshold is probably very likely to be modulated according to the hopper instar. The value quoted above was an average for all of our sampling (1th to 6th instars). Presumably it was lower in the 6th instar and higher in the first, which should be verified on a larger sample. The gregarization threshold may be reflective of the hopper environment, particularly the structure of the vegetation. The latter may be more or less heterogeneous and may promote local concentrations of populations. In general, the distribution of resources such as food, favorable areas of microclimate, and roosting sites are all factors that may help promote gregariousness as has been shown especially in the Desert locust  [16] [17] [18] . However, the Saharan habitats of the Desert locust, a plurivoltin species, can be very diverse, both in space and time. On the contrary, the hoppers of the only annual generation of the Red locust in Madagascar varies between January and March, within the breeding area in the south-west, in a lush, dense vegetation (100% coverage, plant height between 40 and 80 cm on average) whose structure is very similar from one year to the other. We believe that the threshold concept takes on certain significance and is of considerable value for the local antilocust survey service, even if the figures are only a rough estimate. Finally, it is interesting to compare our threshold values to those recorded experimentally for the density at which the coordinated marching behaviour of the gregarious populations appears. Collett et al.  [18]  has shown experimentally, in the third hopper instar of the Desert locust, coordinated movements that are well marked at densities above 74 hoppers/m 2 . However, at densities below 18 hoppers/m 2 , no coordinated movement is noted. Even if the species and conditions were very different from ours (hoppers in the field in dense vegetation compared to hoppers in a circular arena without vegetation), it is interesting to note that our observations give similar values with a phase transformation threshold estimated at 10 hoppers/m 2 and the emergence of real gregarious hoppers from densities of 60-70 hoppers/m 2 . This could be the result of an identical ""radius of influence"", whatever the circumstances and regardless of the stimuli involved. Differences in the gregarization threshold for Migratory, Red and Desert locusts could therefore be the result of the respective structures of these three species' habitats. For adults, the lowest gregarization thresholds were indeed noted for the Desert locust living in habitats where vegetation is scarce and often in clumps and highest for the Red locust living in environments with much wetter, tall, and dense vegetation. 
 Phase Transformation Rapidity and Parental Antecedents. The fact that from solitarious parental populations we can obtain hoppers with perfectly gregarious color characteristics in the next generation may question the rapidity of the gregarization process in the Red locust. Can we consider a parental effect on our results? We know that phase characteristics are transmitted to offspring, a phenomenon well known in the Desert locust and the Migratory locust  [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] . In Madagascar, the early stages of phase transformation are often initiated at the beginning of the rainy season when solitarious populations migrate from the dry season refuge areas to the rainy season breeding areas. Such a phenomenon is observed in the Migratory locust  [49, 60]  as well as in the Red locust  [59] . These migrations often lead to sudden and rapid increases in adult densities allowing the appearance of the first behavioral manifestations of gregarization. The density shock suffered by females during laying can be inherited and affect the phase of the descendant and, in particular, the expression of color polyphenism in the hoppers. Such a parental effect could explain the rapidity of the process observed in the hoppers. Even if the parent populations appear to have been mostly solitarious, observations conducted by the National Anti-Locust Centre have shown the presence of some population densities above the gregarization threshold and a few swarms. In early 2006, in the dry season, the average density in south-western Madagascar was 94 adults/ha (max 680). In the early rainy season of 2006-2007, the average density increased to 664/ha (with one swarm at 160,000/ha), then decreased to 272/ha in the early dry season of 2007 (with four swarms and nine cases where the density exceeded the gregarization threshold of 5,000 adults per hectare). All transiens or gregarious hoppers could descend from parent populations that have already experienced, to varying degrees, a density shock in their history when laying or early in their development over a number of generations. This is impossible to determine, but it would explain the wide range of phase conditions registered in our database. 
 Relative Importance of Various Stimuli in the Gregarization Process. The low densities from which the first transformation phase signs were noted in the Red locust raise questions about the nature of the stimuli involved. Progress has been made in recent years towards understanding the stimuli associated with crowding that evoke gregariousphase characteristics in S. gregaria. The main focus has been on induction of gregarious behavior  [5] . Simpson et al.  [16, 17, 72, [75] [76] [77] [78]  have brilliantly shown in the Desert locust that mechanical stimuli appear to intervene initially; they are potent inducers of phase-transformation behavior and have a central role. The mechanoreceptors responsible are located on the outer face of the hind femur. Various authors have shown, however, especially in the Desert locust, that visual and olfactory stimuli (less active or completely inactive separately) can act synergistically and lead to both gregarious behavior and the development of black spots and yellowing of the cuticle, characteristic of gregarious hoppers  [79] [80] [81] . A former experiment by Launois et al.  [82] , Psyche on the Migratory locust suggests that the daily rhythm of solitarious adults activity collected in the field and tested using actography near the field, can be changed depending on the density of individuals in the experimental room without any tactile contact between them, suggesting the influence of olfactory or visual stimuli in the early stages of behavioral gregarization. More recently, Simpson's group has also shown that tactile stimulation (of the antennae in this case) is necessary to induce behavioural gregarization in the Australian plague locust, Chortoicetes terminifera (Walker, 1870)  [83] . Thus convergent behavioral responses to crowding have certainly evolved, employing different sites of sensory input according to the species. In our case, no apparent manifestation of behavioral gregarization (coordinated movements) seems apparent in hopper populations of the Red locust at densities equal to the gregarization threshold or 10-20 hoppers/m 2 only, far from the hundreds of individuals in gregarious or pregregarious hopper bands. During the rainy season, the hoppers developed in homogeneous, dense vegetation covering the entire ground at an average height of 40 to 80 cm between January and March. However, the first signs of gregarization occurred at these densities, at least the pigmentary signs. The probability of tactile contact in these conditions seems relatively low. Visual, olfactory or auditory signs could also be very important in the early stages of the gregarization process when locust densities are too low (and therefore when a natural tendency for repulsion still occurs) and vegetation density is too high to allow frequent contact between individuals. Of course, in nature, mechanical, chemical, visual and auditory stimuli are all present and must act synergistically. The importance of these various factors in the induction of gregarization in the Red locust needs to be clarified in natural conditions. An excellent knowledge of the transiens phase and of its first signs is thus of fundamental interest. Figure 1 : 1 Color patterns and morphological variables selected to characterize the pigmentation of Red Locust hoppers. Note that the subocular stripe is a constant characteristic of the Red Locust but, in case of gregarisation, it tends to disappear under the general black pigmentation of the posterior part of the head.

Codification of the variables (red dots): (1) variables related to the black pigmentation (0, 1 or 2 according to the melanisation intensity): compound eye (E), cephalic capsule (H), median carina of pronotum (CP), wings rudiments (W); lateral black spot of pronotum (LP), black spot on hind femur (F); (2) variables related to the general color of the tegument (V, green; B, brown; O, orange; J, yellow): cephalic capsule (GC) and pronotum (GP).

 of 30 - 70 /m 2 . 30702 Conversely, the lateral pronotal spot was very pronounced in only one third of the hoppers at a density of 70-100/m 2 . It was strongly marked in all the hoppers for densities greater than 100/m 2 . The background color of the pronotum, mostly green in individuals in very low densities, turned yellow in the majority of hoppers at a density of 10-30/m 2 . The darkening of the wing pad veins appeared later. It was significant in one third of individuals at a density of 70-100/m 2 . Above a density of 100/m 2 , all hoppers had strongly melanised wing pads. The femoral spot appeared at a density of 10-30/m 2 and it was predominant in half of the hoppers at a density of 30-70/m 2 . It was present and strongly marked in all hoppers at high densities (>100/m 2 ). Finally, the first transiens hoppers appeared at a density of only 10-20 hoppers/m 2 (Figure 5).4. Discussion4.1. Characterization of the Hopper Phase. The results from our field study on Red Locust hopper pigmentation established a clear typology, which strictly reflected the increasing densities of the populations. This correlates with the results obtained by Gunn and Hunter-Jones [63] on the regular gradient of pigmentation in relation to hopper density in the Migratory locust under laboratory conditions. In our case, this gradient reflected the gradual development of individuals from the solitarious state to the gregarious state through several intermediate transiens stages. Up to nine transiens categories were distinguished. Finally, only two were selected for a practical classification to highlight the first key stage of the gregarization process represented by the solitaro-transiens individuals. For each density, hopper populations were composed of a mixture of several color types in varying proportions. The proposed criteria were simple and unambiguous. The information collected by the National Anti-Locust Centre in Madagascar on the phase status of hopper populations could thus become precise, reinforcing the reliability of the survey protocol on this species.

E-mail: adansi2001@gmail.com or agrobreed.fast@gmail.com.  (Shippers, 2000) . In the Republic of Benin, they occur as cultivated and semi-cultivated crops or weedy and wild plants, with ecological, social and cultural values, playing a significant role in the daily food and nutritional requirements of local people mainly in rural areas, but more increasingly in urban zones. Recent surveys implemented throughout the country revealed 187 species of TLVs of interest, among which are Acmella uliginosa and Justicia tenella  (Dansi et al., 2008a . A. uliginosa and J. tenella are distributed throughout Africa  (Shippers, 2000)  where they are known at both cultivated and wild state. In Benin, these neglected and underutilized species (NUS) are locally cultivated mainly in the northern part of the country, where they are intensively consumed  (Dansi et al., 2008b; Adéoti et al., 2009) . A. uliginosa is a key nutraceutical for local rural populations. It is used as an antibiotic, which stimulates milk production and facilitates the elimination of blood clots in women after delivery . J. tenella is also an appreciated leafy vegetable. The leaves are cooked and consumed as spinach. For medicinal purposes, the leaves are used to treat cardiac disorder, diarrhoea, fever and indigestion  (Denton, 2004; Dansi et al., 2008c) . The plant possesses anti-inflammatory activity and is also used as antidepressant  (Sanmugapriya et al., 2005) . Thus, is of paramount importance that the agro biodiversity of these important NUS be precisely characterised with the use of modern molecular tools. Genetic resour-ces must be preserved based on this accurate characterization for the benefit of local populations. The assessment of intraspecific genetic diversity and the understanding of its structure are a prerequisite for any further action. To the best of our knowledge, such information has never been reported on these species. There are now a number of molecular markers which have proven very efficient in assessing plant genetic diversity  (Santoni et al., 2000) . Among them, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)  (Vos et al., 1995)  has been found to be the most appropriate in many cases. AFLPs were described as a powerful and efficient approach in population genetics and diversity analysis, molecular taxonomic classification, gene mapping and marker-assisted breeding for various crops  (Ayele et al., 1999; Carr et al., 2003; Uptmoor et al., 2003) . AFLP analysis provides an effective means of covering large area of the genome in a single assay  (Ayad et al., 1997; Milbourne et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 1999; Muminovic et al., 2004) . It is highly reproducible and discriminative  (Rafalski and Tingey, 1993; Savelkoul et al., 1999; Soleimani et al., 2002) , and generate a virtually unlimited number of genetic markers  (Blears et al., 1998; Gaudeul et al., 2000) . AFLP has been already used to assess genetic diversity in many crops such as hibiscus  (Tiang et al., 2003) , peach  (Xu et al., 2006) , linseed  (Adugna et al., 2006) , soybean  (Tara Satyavathi et al., 2006) , Rice  (Mackill et al., 1996) , wheat  (Shoaib and Arabi, 2006) , sesame  (Laurentin and Karlovsky, 2007)  and fonio  (Adoukonou-Sagbadja et al., 2007) . In this study, we used AFLP markers to assess the genetic diversity and analyse the relationship among accessions of A. uliginosa and J. tenella collected from different agroecological zones of Benin, West Africa. 
 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 Plant material The plant materials under study consists of seventeen accessions of A. uliginosa and fourteen accessions of J. tenella collected from various villages  (Table 1 ) located in the northern part of Benin  (Adeoti et al., 2009) . Accessions were maintained as field collections at the Biological Control Station of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) based in Cotonou, Benin. 
 DNA extraction In order to take into account possible individual genetic variability within each accession, total genomic DNA was extracted from bulked young leaves (100 to 200 mg FW per accession) collected from ten 2-to 3-week-old plants. DNA from freshly collected material was extracted following the MATAB (mixed alkyltriméthylammonium bromide) procedure according to  Doyle and Doyle (1990) . After RNAse treatment, DNA content was fluorometrically quantified (GENIOS PLUS TECAN Scientific Instruments) using Hoechst 33258 dye and diluted to 25 ng/µl working solution. 
 AFLP protocol AFLP analysis was performed as originally described by  Vos et al. (1995)  with minor modifications. Here, 250 ng of genomic DNA (10 µl of working solution) were digested using EcoRI and MseI restriction enzymes and the generated fragments were ligated with double-stranded site-specific adapters using T4 DNA ligase. Following ligation, a pre-amplification was carried out with primers containing one selective nucleotide cytosine and adenine for MseI and EcoRI primers, respectively. PCR was performed for 30 cycles which consisted of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 56°C, and 1 min at 72°C with final extension for 3 min at 72°C. Resulting PCR products were 10 times diluted with sterile double distilled water and used as templates for the selective amplification step. This was carried out with a couple of selective primers (EcoRI/MseI) containing three selective nucleotides at the side. EcoRI was labelled with fluorescent dye. Selective amplification was performed on two steps in a total volume of 20 µl containing 5 µl of diluted pre-selective PCR product, 2 µl of each primer at 1 pmole/µl for EcoANN and 5 pmole/µl for MseCNN and 0.2 µl of 1 U of Taq polymerase. The first step of selective amplification consisted of 12 cycles, 3 min at 94°C, 45 s at 94°C, 45 s at 65°C and 1 min at 72°C for final extension. The second step was performed for 25 cycles which consisted of 45 s at 94°C, 45 s at 56°C, 1 min at 72°C and 3 min at 72°C. The PCR products of selective amplification were diluted 10 times and an aliquot (2 µl) of diluted solution was mixed with 18 µl of a ROXlabeled internal size standard (AMM 524). Then the mixture was denaturated for 5 min at 95°C, loaded and separated on an ABI PRISM 3130X Genetic Analyzer sequencer (Applied Biosystems). 
 Scoring and analysis of AFLP data Electrophoregram generated by the sequencer were analysed using the GeneMapper version 3.7 software package  (Applied Biosystem, 2004) . Clear and unambiguous peaks were considered as AFLP markers and scored as present (1) or absent (0) in order to generate a binary data matrix. The total number of scored markers and the number and percentage of polymorphic markers were determined for each primer pair used. Polymorphic markers were used for further data analysis. With the binary matrix (0, 1) compiled, pairwise relatedness between all accessions was esti-   (Perrier and Jacquemoud-Collet, 2006 ) and the Neighbor-joining method, a dendrogram was generated with the aim of analysing the relationship between accessions. The binary matrix was also used to undertake a factorial coordinate analysis (FCA) with the same software in order to obtain a graphical representation of the genetic diversity patterns existing among accessions. 
 RESULTS 
 Diversity among A. uliginosa accessions A total of four pairs of primer combinations were screened. Among these, only three generated useful amplification products with a high polymorphism; these were selected for DNA profiling. Sequences of selected primers, total number of generated markers and associated polymorphism are shown in  Table 2 . The number of amplicons obtained per primer combination ranged from 51 to 88 and the percentage of polymorphic amplicons generated by each primer combination ranged from 30 to 71%  (Table 2) . A total of 224 amplicons (50 to 500 pb) was generated, from which 50.50% (114 amplicons) were found to be polymorphic. The genetic dissimilarity index calculated between accessions ranged from 0.01 to 0.67  (Table 3 ). The lowest value was obtained between AA12 collected at Perporiyakou 2 and AA11 collected at Koupagou, while the highest value was calculated between AA1 and AA7 sampled at Boukoumbé and Péporiyakou1, respectively. The generated dendrogram based on the dissimilarity matrix  (Table 3)  using the    
 Diversity among J. tenella accessions Five primers combinations were used to assess the genetic diversity among J. tenella accessions  (Table 2) . A total of 418 fragments were produced among which, only 144 were found to be polymorphic. The average polymorphic rate was 34%. The number of amplicons per primer combination ranged from 60 to 93 and the percentage of polymorphic amplicons varied from 16 to 49%  (Table 2 ). The dissimilarity indexes among accessions varied from 0.17 to 0.62  (Table 4)    similarity index (the highest dissimilarity) was found between the accession collected at Boroyerou (County of Borgou) and the one sampled at Dangoussar (County of Atakora). The highest similarity index was calculated between the individual taken at Péporiyakou (Atakora) and the one collected at Sonoumon (Atakora). The dendrogram revealed three genetic groups, designated as I, II and III  (Figure 4) . Apart from the group III which joins two accessions from the County of Borgou, the other two groups are composed of samples from both Borgou and Atakora. 
 DISCUSSION The amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis revealed a high level of similarity between accessions of A. uliginosa. This is an indication of low genetic diversity among the collected accessions. Cluster II of the UPGMA dendrogram (  Figure 1 ) based on the dissimilarity matrix assembles individuals from Dangoussar, Kawado and Cobly, three geographically distinct bordering villages of Togo (  Figure 3) . Somehow, these results are in agreement with the farmers' assumptions which depict this species as originating from Togo  (Adéoti et al., 2009) . Three accessions from this cluster which were collected at Péporiyakou, Boukoumbé and Tchakalakou seem to be genetically different. They probably originate from another ancient introduction of the species into Benin from Burkina Faso. A second hypothesis suggests the existence of pure specimen or hybrids from Acmella oleracea, a wild relative of A. uliginosa which is well known by farmers. Nevertheless, a precise morphological examination of these three samples by taxonomists from the National Herbarium of Benin confirmed their identity as A. uliginosa, which makes more plausible our first hypothesis. In fact, the Wama, Ditamari and Natimba ethnic groups from these villages are all originating from both Burkina Faso (mainly) and Togo  (Adam and Boco, 1993) . The use of this species by the Gourmantché ethnic group (from Burkina Faso), the recent findings on the multiple origins of fonio in Benin  (Adoukonou-Sagbadja et al., 2006; Adoukonou-Sagbadja et al., 2007; Dansi et al., 2010)  as well as the grouping of Benin ethnic groups based on their origin with regard to the leafy vegetables species they consume  (Dansi et al., 2008a) , concomitantly support this hypothesis. Then diversification observed among A. uliginosa' accessions could be related to people migration through this part of country. Contrary to A. uliginosa, no clear genetic structuring could be obtained within the accessions of J. tenella  (Figure 4 ) despite the high level of amplicons generated per primer. Other AFLP markers could be tested to confirm once again this result. The two major clusters assemble individuals collected from Atakora as well as those from Borgou. Therefore, the accessions collected from the Northwest were not genetically very different from the ones collected from the Northeast. This result was rather expected when our previous report is considered  (Adéoti et al., 2009 ). Indeed, we described this species as mainly located in the Northeast with a spread towards the Western region resulting from the migration of people. 
 Conclusion Results from the present study confirm the robustness and the suitability of the AFLP approach for plant diversity analysis and for the assessment of genetic relationship among individuals of a given species collected from different locations. We have applied this technique to two different neglected and underutilized species from Benin (A. uliginosa L. and J. tenella (Nees) T.) for the first time. More investigations are needed to clarify the origin (single or multiple) of A. uliginosa in Benin taking into account accessions from Togo and Burkina Faso. Likewise, other molecular markers such as ISSR or microsatellites could be useful to deepen the genetic relationship among accessions of these two species. The present study will be extended to two morphologically close species of TLVs (Sesamum radiatum and Ceratotheca sesamoides) in order to examine their genetic relationship and to explore the relationship between ecology (soil, climate) and genetic diversity.

SUDBIOTECH: A training initiative in plant biotechnology dedicated to scientific communities in developing and emerging countries. Notulae Botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca, 38 (2) (spec.) : p. 16-21.",22,20101001,SUDBIOTECH: A Training Initiative in Plant Biotechnology Dedicated to Scientific Communities in Developing and Emerging Countries,,"Introduction Struggling for food safety, emerging and developing nations must face numerous challenges. Indeed, the aim of attaining food self-sufficiency is seriously hampered by increasing in population witch is far greater than the corresponding increase in food supply. Besides this major constraint, these nations must cope with limited financial resources, the absence of technology adapted to growth and development, the erosion of biodiversity and growing environmental concerns. According to  FAO (2009) , severe nutrition problems now affect about one billion human beings on Earth. In order to compensate the continuous demographic growth, food production will have to increase at the rate of 2.3% per year. In order to attain such a growth rate in agricultural production, under an unpredictable context of global climatic changes, we will have to make a smart use of any available agro ecological solution. Among many others, these include: -the use of phytosanitary treatments -soil amendments and mitigation of erosion -the use of organic and chemical fertilisers 
 B. Challenges Our partners are Universities and Research Centres located in developing countries (mainly in French speaking Northern and Western Africa at the moment). For our partners, major challenges include the renewal and updating of teaching in Plant Science, and more specifically in Plant Molecular Biology and Physiology, the capacity building of PhD students and junior research staff and lecturers together with the mastering of new emerging technologies and concepts in molecular analysis. The project is intended as a first step for the setting up of a perennial training network for local research staff, based on the transfer of technologies of potential interest for the development of the country. It is also important to train a group of young dedicated people who can play a role in the smart decision making requested by Governments on sensitive subjects such as  Biotechnologies and Development (Thompson, 2010) . For the involved group of French scientist and their respective institutions of origin, it is important to build up and maintain a sustainable North-South partnership between French Speaking Universities and the French project SudBiotech (University of Paris-Orsay, CNRS, Cirad). The challenge is to share and broadcast knowledge and to adapt emerging technologies to the specific needs of societies in the Developing World. C. Expected outputs -A continuous process of self-organisation of capacity building in scientific communities in South countries -Better job opportunities for local junior lecturers and research staff -An enriching sharing of experiences between North and South and a first step for online training and the generation of multimedia training tools -Opportunities for French Speaking Universities to share competencies from their academics and research staff on various areas of plant biotechnologies -An open project for other potential teachers from other French institutions (INRA, CNRS, Cirad, IRD) and Universities for the development of other complementary modules (genetic engineering, plant pathology, etc.). 
 D. The SudBiotech team The present SudBiotech teaching group has been coordinated by Prof. Michel Dron (IPB, University of Paris-Orsay); its present members are: -Dr. Aimé Nato, Senior Lecturer, University of Paris-Orsay, -Dr. Yves Henry, Research Director at the Institute of Plant Biotechnology (CNRS, University of Paris-Orsay) -Dr. Alain Rival, Research Director at Cirad, Montpellier -improved agricultural practices and association/rotation of cultures -irrigation -plant breeding and biotechnologies Given the fact that the majority of communities in developing countries lives in rural areas and directly depends on agriculture for surviving, the rural sector is of paramount importance for the fragile economy of these countries. The expected increase in agricultural productivity will have to take place under the framework of a sustainable agricultural development, without any negative impact on the environment. In this context, the careful exploitation of plant biotechnology has a role to play in rural development, in the protection of biodiversity and plant genetic resources and in the long term preservation of the environment. Plant biotechnologies are able to provide amazing tools for plant breeding, as they offer to the breeder the possibility to circumvent natural borders, to fine-tune the creation of new plant varieties and to accelerate the distribution of genetic progress to end users. Thus plant breeders originating from developing and emerging countries must be able to master, monitor and adapt this technology to strategic commodities for their region of origin. In emerging and less advanced countries, the challenges supported by plant biotechnologies are of paramount importance and the lack of information, training and capacity building in the scientific communities generates a continuously growing demand. 
 A. Objectives of the Project The SudBiotech training project (University of Paris-Orsay/CNRS/Cirad) presents a multidisciplinary itinerary, aimed a discovering some original characteristics and potentialities of the plant cell. The project is dispensed by senior academics and research staff working in complementary scientific areas in the aim of integrating various domains of Plant Science  (Costa and Shaw, 2007) : totipotency, morphogenesis and plant elaboration, mechanisms of cell division, developmental signals, genotype to phenotype, genetic engineering, etc. Our priority is to establish a long-term, continuous system for training and capacity building, based on appropriate tools for scientific communities in developing and emerging countries: training of PhD students, job opportunities in their native country/region, overseas training, access to scientific information and literature and access to funding opportunities and international networks. It is important to note that any training material which is produced under the framework of SudBiotech is graciously given without any Intellectual Property Rights to partner institutions, in order to constitute a local basis for training in Plant Biotechnologies in beneficiary countries. Yves Henry and Aimé Nato are the authors of a new web site hosted by the University of Paris-Orsay which is dedicated to the multifaceted world of plant biotechnologies (http://www.cetice.u-psud.fr/cetice/2007/ogm/) Alain Rival shares with the team his experience in tropical and Mediterranean plant breeding, an important dimension of the training for students in developing and emerging countries. The team as whole has a strong expertise in lecturing and tutoring in French Speaking Universities (AUPELF-UREF projects in Marocco, Tunisia, Togo, Côte d'Ivoire, TEMPUS Programme in Lebanon, AUF-Actions de Recherche en Réseau in Benin). The project has been launched by Professor Alfred Traore, at the University of Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) in 2007. Prof. Traore is in charge of the Regional Centre of Excellence for Research and Training in Biotechnology which joins several National Universities from Western Africa: Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, Niger, Cameroon, and Togo. Later, Jininkun a NGO specialised in plant genetic resources in Benin, has partly used our training itinerary for a Seminar organized in Cotonou in December 2007. SudBiotech has been extended to Benin, under the auspices of Professor Ambaliou Sanni from the Faculté des Sciences et Techniques at the Abomey-Calavi University in Cotonou. Indeed, an International Workshop on Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology has been organised in November 2008, gathering more than 30 students and junior lecturers/researchers originating from the region. Under the framework of an AUF funded project ""Actions de Recherche en Réseau"", SudBiotech has initiated a new project in 2009, covering a co-supervised PhD work and two International Workshops on site. The first workshop has been organised in July 2009 in Cotonou and a second one will be held in December 2010. 
 E. How does it work? The training is basically dedicated to students from Masters 1 and 2 level and PhD schools from Universities in developing and emerging French Speaking countries. The training itinerary has been presented under the form of a one-week workshop to the Universities of Beyrouth (Lebanon), Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) and Cotonou (Benin). To date, we have trained students with backgrounds in Biotechnologies, Biosafety and Medicine. Targeted audience include not only lecturers and research staff in Plant Biotechnologies, but also NGO staff, lawyers, journalists and members of any involved community. 
 E.1. On-site training SudBiotech on site training is organised under the form of a one-week workshop, which includes not only formal lectures, but also literature analysis, practical training and public debates. The Workshop also includes several session dedicated to the future researcher's life of students: scientific CV, projects and reports writing and presentation, literature and data mining through the Internet, carrier and mobility, etc. Organisers dedicate a lot of space and time for experimental training and critical observation of results (see  Fig.  1 ). Through the results of several evaluation surveys implemented at the end of Workshops, it appeared that this opportunity to actually experience real-life research was one of the major benefits acknowledged by participants. The workshop timetable also includes informal discussions on various topics (public/private research relationship, researcher's carrier and evaluation, research organisation, mobility, etc.) The organisers share as much time as possible with students for individual interviews and specific training needs. A typical program, such as the one proposed for the July 2009 SudBiotech Workshop in Cotonou is given in Tab. 1. This timetable gives a realistic idea of the covered scientific areas and the distribution between Lectures, Tutored Work and Experimental Programs. A total training time of 50h is proposed to the students. The final timetable is discussed with the partner university long before the launching of the Workshop, thus enabling any adaptation to students' curricula or specific needs for training and/or information. The SudBiotech group really wants the content and organization of the on site training to be as flexible and open as possible. At the beginning of the Workshop, a group of volunteer redactors is chosen: this group of students will be in charge of writing the final report on a day-to-day basis, with the help of SudBiotech teachers. It is also in charge of wrapping-up and summarizing the progression of the training itinerary and reporting to the whole group every morning. By experience, such a program often appears as packed and very dense to the students. This is reflected by most of the results of the Evaluation Survey implemented at the end of Workshop (Tab. 1). In best of worlds, such a program should be organised on a 10-14 days basis, with shorter working days and more time and space left for informal discussions in smaller groups or face-to-face with teachers. Practically, this goal is difficult to reach, given the budget constraints and the restricted availability of members of the SudBiotech group, who are involved in several other international projects. The training project is amplified and enriched through the pivotal role of local research and training staff, who are encouraged to actively participate in the SudBiotech project, under various form including lectures, field visits, practical sessions, etc. We consider this point as very important, as the involvement of local staff is the key for the long term existence of the project. 
 E.2. A new tool for the future: the SudBiotech Training Trunk In order to reinforce the SudBiotech initiative on a longer term, the idea is to design a Training Trunk as a physi-cal tool dedicated to on site training in Plant Biotechnologies. The trunk will gather the whole set of teaching material for the autonomous implementation of the training itinerary. The SudBiotech training trunk will enable to propose not only audiovisual presentations (PowerPoint lectures, bibliography, posters and films) but also all the basic equipment for experimentations in biochemistry and molecular biology (DNA extraction, PCR, electrophoresis, immunoblotting). Depending on various different requests from partner organisations (Universities, Research and Training Centres, NGOs) and the available dedicated budget, the Training Trunk will be either given as it stands for the continuation of on-site teaching by local staff, or it will be repatriated to France in order to be replenished with consumables and reused for the following session. On the short term, the SudBiotech team will be in charge of the production, multiplication and identification in France of the material dedicated to experimental training: in vitro cultivated plant cells and organs, preparation and purification of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies for immunoblotting, immunotransfer of proteins on nitrocellulose membranes. As soon as possible, the team will adapt various protocols to local conditions and plant material, in order to promote an autonomous use of the Training Trunk in the near future. In Molecular Biology, the SudBiotech group will constantly transfer new research results and recent technology in order to update the proposed experimental training, such as the identification of nucleotide sequences in genetically engineered material. Our training strategy being based on the experimental approach of biological phenomena, it is important that all the biological situations explored by students are illustrated by clear and concrete biological models. The strategy is to look for organisations and bodies which can fund the designing of a prototype, made of two different compartments: Audiovisual and Experimental. The total budget for this phase has been estimated at 23,000 euros (Tab. 2). Performances of the prototype will be analysed during a training session organised on site and evaluated by the SudBiotech group, together with participants, students and local staff (who are the end users!). Limitations and drawbacks will have to be identified, according to difficulties encountered on site (logistics, technical constraints) and the needs expressed by partners (program of the session, content of lectures and experimental training, fulfilment of local needs, expectations from the audience) The local group of teachers will be trained by the Sud-Biotech group to the maintenance and adaptation of the Training Trunk and to the multiplication and preservation of the necessary living plant material. The identifica- approach of plant biotechnology to their future training and lecturing programs. tion of biological systems of local origin will be part of the training. The prototype will be also useful in the prospection of new partnership and indispensable on site demos. To date, several Universities and research centres are interested in the project; they include the Universities of Sfax (Tunisia), Kaslik (Lebanon), the Universidad Nacional de Colombia in Bogotà and the CERD (Centre d'Etudes et de Recherche de Djibouti). 
 Conclusions and future directions The SudBiotech project presents an original approach for training and capacity building in plant biotechnology. It is based on on-site interactive training sessions in Universities and research Centres in developing countries. In the near future, the creation of the SudBiotech Training Trunk will enable to undertake these training sessions on a more autonomous way, and to deliver to partner institution a set of ready-to-use training tools for the perpetuation of the Project. It is expected that the first generation of trained young research will keep the momentum and integrate this global Fig. 1 . 1 Results from Experimental Programs as realised in Cotonou AUF Workshop in 2009 Fig. 1A.

BLAKE WOOD,,"INTRODUCTION Wood density and the angle of its microfibrils in the secondary wall are of particular interest for breeding programs  (Raymond 2002)  since they are the two main factors affecting wood mechanical properties. Microfibril angle (MFA) is a property of the cell wall of wood fibres, which is made up of millions of strands of cellulose called microfibrils  (Fang et al. 2006 ). This elementary wood trait represents the orientation of crystalline cellulose in the cell wall along the fiber axis  (Andersson et al. 2000) . MFA has major effects on two key properties of wood: its stiffness and longitudinal shrinkage. For instance,  Cave (1968)  demonstrated that a reduction in MFA from 40° in the corewood to 10° in the outerwood increases the stiffness of the cell wall fivefold. This finding was confirmed by  Via et al. (2009) , who reported a fourfold increase in stiffness of longleaf pine when the microfibril angle dropped from 40° to 5°. The early optical measurements of MFA were extremely tedious, but currently a wide range of different methods are available to evaluate MFA in wood (reviewed by  Donaldson 2008) . Among all available techniques only X-ray diffractometry is suitable for quick MFA measurements for a large number of samples  (Evans et al. 1996; Evans 1999 ). X-ray diffractometry has been largely used thanks to the crystalline arrangement of cellulose microfibrils in the wood cell wall; it allows studying not only its organization (like MFA), but also its apparent crystal size  (Washusen and Evans 2001)  or its mechanical state  (Clair et al. 2006) . MFA and wood density presents a variable relationship  (Donaldson 2008) . For instance,  Fang et al. (2004)  reported significant correlation between MFA and wood density  (-0.45)  for Populus, while no correlation was found in Picea by  Bergander et al. (2002)  and in Taiwania by  Lin and Chiu (2007) . In Eucalyptus,  Evans et al. (2000)  reported no correlation between whole tree average density and MFA in 15-year-old Eucalyptus nitens. The radial variation and the correlation between MFA and density is still not clear in Eucalyptus requiring further studies. Therefore, the aims of this study were: i) to investigate the radial variation of microfibril angle (MFA) and wood density in Eucalyptus wood, and ii) to generate a better understanding about the correlation between MFA and wood density, as well as the influence of age on these relationships. Here, we used 2-mm tangential sections of Eucalyptus urophylla wood to evaluate the MFA by X-ray diffraction technique  (Cave 1966) . Each tangential section was cut as parallel as possible to the growth rings. Thus, the samples taken close to the pith presents a ""curvature effect,"" while the tangential sections taken near the bark, parallel to the growth ring, showed little or no ""curvature effect"". Hence, an additional objective of this study was to verify the influence of the curvature effect on the repeatability of the XRD measurements. 
 EXPERIMENTAL 
 Wood Origin 40 breast height wood disks of 14-year-old Eucalyptus urophylla S.T. Blake trees from the progeny test in Republic of Congo were used in this study.  Hein et al. (2010)  presented details of sampling procedure and the chemical composition of the trees from the same progeny trial. 
 Sampling Preparation From each disc, a pith to bark radial strip was removed by a vertical bandsaw. The radial strips were marked randomly but well distributed along the radial gradient on the strips in order to supply tangential sections, as parallel as possible to the growth rings for microfibril angle, and small samples for wood density measurements  (Fig. 1) . While from the large radial strips it was possible to take 4 or 5 samples (for instance,  Fig.1) , only two or three samples were removed from radial strips with small dimensions. The radial strips were classified in five classes (from A to E), depending on their relative radial position. The tangential sections cut from the region close to the pith presented the stronger ""curvature effect"", while the tangential sections cut near the bark, parallel to the growth ring, showed little or no curvature effect  (Fig. 1) . The samples were sectioned along to the wood strips in the same proportion as well as possible, but no sample was taken from class A because of operational limitations. 
 Microfibril Angle Measurement All X-ray diffraction data were collected with a diffractometer (Gemini-S, Agilent Technologies, Yarnton, UK) with CuK α radiation. Images were integrated between 2θ = 21.5 and 23.5 along the whole 360° azimutal interval to plot the intensity diagram of the  (200)  plane. An automatic procedure allowed the detection of the 200 peaks and their inflexion points. The T parameter, as defined by  Cave (1966) , was measured as the half distance between intersections of tangents at inflexion points with the baseline. The results are given as the mean of values obtained for the two 200 peaks. As shown by  Cave (1966) , the T parameter is affected by the cross-sectional shape of the cells. Thus, as also reported by  Yamamoto et al. (1993)  and latter  Ruelle et al. (2007) , the corrective factor proposed by  Cave (1966)  cannot be used for all species but needs to be calibrated for each species. However, their works show that the T parameter allows comparison within a given species, which is the purpose of our study. In our study, we considered that the cross-sectional shape of the cells remain constant enough from pith to bark to allows comparison with a single T parameter within the species.

(1993)  was applied in order to estimate the MFA based on their X-ray diffraction pattern. The formula gives an estimation of the mean MFA of woods based on their T value and is given by:             T T T MFA (1) Three X-ray diffraction profiles were recorded on three points, namely T 1 , T 2 , and T 3 , of each sample  (Fig. 1) .

Dotted lines show the correspondence between the peak on the integrated pattern and the spot on the diffraction image. For each sample, integration yields two symmetric peaks located at 90° and 270°. The dotted line in red is the base line, and the red arrows are the T parameter. Sample A shows a narrow peak (T=15.4°), corresponding to a low MFA, while sample B shows a wide peak (T=37.4°) corresponding to a large MFA. 
 Wood Density Measurement The offcut samples between the tangential sections (  Fig. 1 b)  were used for basic density measurements, which was determined by the ASTM D2395  (ASTM 2002)  procedures. 
 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The wood basic density and T parameter measurements  (Table 1 ) showed a range of variation of ca. 14.5%. The approach for conversion of the X-ray diffractometer pattern to microfibril angle is based on the T parameter, but the MFA had the higher coefficient of variation (17.1%). The range of variation of the investigated properties is crucial for Eucalyptus breeding programs, whereas the breeders are interesting in finding significant differences between progenies or clones.  
 Radial Variability While data between 20 to 40% of radial distance represent the samples from class B, which correspond to the wood formed at the 4 th to 6 th year, the data from the last 20% (from 80 to 100%) correspond to the wood developed at approximately the 12 th , 13 th and 14 th years.  Figure 3  presents the variation of MFA and density as a function of the relative distance from the pith to bark for 14 radial strips. The samples were ranked by radial position in ascending order from 0.22 to 0.97 of their relative radial position, and the mean comparisons were performed for each class (B to E). Due to the small dimension of some radial strips, we removed only two or three tangential sections for MFA, and small wood samples for density from them and these data were not presented in the graphic. The mean MFA values of each class (B to E) were not statistically different by the Tukey test at P>0.01, while the mean basic density of wood significantly increased in a linear way from pith to bark. Thus, the radial variation of MFA in Eucalyptus wood is not statistically evident, because the large MFA variability between trees results in a large standard deviation within each class (for instance, in class B the MFA ranged from ca. 11° to ca. 19°). However, a decrease of MFA values from pith to bark can be observed.  Figure 3 -A reveals that, on average, the microfibril angles appears to be higher near the pith of the discs (Class B), decreasing radially towards to the bark (Class E). Such pattern of MFA variation occurred most frequently, but among the various strips we used (40), different trends could be observed. For instance, the MFA of samples 80, 87, 96, 103, and 153 slightly increased near to the bark. For basic density of wood, a linear increase from pith to bark was found  (Figure 3-B) , even if the variability of density between trees was taken into account. The patterns of radial variation of these Eucalyptus wood traits are in accordance with those reported in the literature. For instance,  Evans et al. (2000)  reported variation in MFA from 20° at the pith to 14° at the bark in 15-year-old Eucalyptus nitens.  Lima et al. (2004)  investigated 8-year-old E. grandis × E. urophylla clones, reporting that its MFA decreased slightly from pith to bark. The radial variation of these wood traits is important, because such properties are targeted in breeding programs to distinguish improved varieties according to their variance; however, frequently, the within-tree variability is higher than the between-trees variability. Regarding to this issue, the fundamental question should be posed: do trees producing low MFA in the first years of their development continue presenting low MFA over the years?  Evans et al. (2000)  reported variation patterns in MFA and density in Eucalyptus, showing that the trend lines for 29 E. nitens tend to be approximately parallel. This means that trees presenting high MFA or density when young will continue to having high MFA or density when mature. In this study,  Figure 3  shows the MFA and ρ for all ages, providing to the tree breeders clear evidences for ρ, but rough indications for MFA.  
 Correlation among MFA Estimates Three X-ray diffraction profiles were recorded on three points of each tangential section  (Fig. 1) . Considering that the measurement at the central point (MFA 2 ) represents precisely the information of a tangential surface and that the measurement at the external points (MFA 1 and MFA 3 ) includes tangential information, but also radial (at least partially) information, mainly in samples near to the pith, it is interesting to analyze the correlation among the MFA values according to the points of measurement. The tangential sections cut near to the pith presented the stronger ""curvature effect,"" whereas the samples near to the bark, parallel to the growth ring, showed little or no curvature effect  (Fig. 1) . Thus, at the outset, we expected to find higher deviation between MFA estimates in the samples cut near the pith, since its ""curvature effect"" is expected to be stronger. No sample was taken from class A because of the technical difficulty and risk of cutting tangential section from the remaining end of the radial strips.  Table 2  presents the correlation among MFA recorded at the three points of each wood section using all samples (Classes B to E). Although it is intuitive, due to the effect of distance between measurements the correlation MFA 1 /MFA 3 (0.82) was slightly lower than those for MFA 1 /MFA 2 (0.84) and MFA 2 /MFA 3 (0.91). The average between measurements 1 and 3 (MFA 1,3 ) were also strongly correlated with local measurements 1 (0.95), 2 (0.93), and 3 (0.96). The correlation between the measurement at point 2 (central) and the three averaged measurements (MFA 1,2,3 ) was very strong (0.97). This finding suggested that a single measurement of the T value, preferably at the centre of each tangential section, is enough to precisely evaluate the MFA of the tangential section. Three measurements are time-consuming and did not provide additional information on MFA in Eucalyptus wood. Additionally, we calculated the correlations among MFA recorded at the three points of each wood section according to the classes (B, C, D and E) where they were cut (not shown). The correlations between MFA's were always strong indicating that the Xray approach is a repeatable method and that the curvature effect plays a negligible role on the repeatability of measurements. 
 Correlation among MFA and Density The density and MFA showed no significant correlation (r = ca. 0.11) when considering all classes  (Table 3) . A weak correlation between MFA and density was observed for samples from Class B (r = ca. -0.18) and Class C (r = ca. -0.13), but the relationships among these traits disappeared with age.   Evans et al. (2000)  compared MFA and density of 29 Eucalyptus nitens wood samples, finding good local relationships between MFA and density, but the whole tree average MFA and density yielded no correlation.  Bergander et al. (2002)  found no correlation between fiber morphology (i.e., average length, width, density) and mean fibril angle in wood samples of 100-year-old Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.). Similarly,  Lin and Chiu (2007)  studied such wood traits in 20-year-old Taiwania (Taiwania cryptomerioides) trees and reported no significant relationship between microfibril angle and wood density.  Figure 4  shows the relationships between MFA and basic density of Eucalyptus wood, showing the classes of radial position by colors. While samples from class B (21-40%) are concentrated in the zone of low density, most samples from class E (81-100%) have high densities. According to  Donaldson (2008) , it seems likely that any relationship between MFA and density is entirely coincidental, since MFA is not related to fiber wall thickness. However, the amount of juvenile wood and latewood might be responsible for relationships in some cases since both MFA and density are related to these factors. The weak correlations between microfibril angle and density found in the present study seem to support such argument. The use of X-ray diffraction to evaluate MFA in woods has two substantial advantages: speed and accuracy sufficient for genetic studies. The T parameter measurements have an error of ca. 0.6 degrees (ca. 3%), but they are able to distinguish trees that produce wood with larger or smaller microfibril angles. For genetic studies, the absolute value of the property is of no matter. The interesting point is to know the relative value of the characteristic between trees, its variation within stem, and its stability. Since phenotyping tools are required in genetic studies and breeding programs, our results can be useful for selection of candidate genotypes or commercial clones in forestry industries from a large wood sampling. 
 CONCLUDING REMARKS A decrease of microfibril angles from pith to bark could be verified for some of these 14-year-old Eucalyptus urophylla wood samples; however, some radial strips presented different patterns of variation. Due to the sampling procedure, the radial variation of MFA could not be statistically analyzed. For basic density, a linear significant increase from pith to bark was observed. There was no significant correlation between microfibril angle and density. The supposed ""curvature effect"" due to the growth rings had a negligible effect on the three measurements of tangential sections cut near to the pith. The relationships among the three MFA estimates by X-ray diffraction on each tangential section were strong. The high correlation between the MFA estimated at the central location and the three averaged MFA estimates suggests that a single measurement of the MFA value, preferably at the centre of each tangential section, is enough to precisely evaluate this trait.

However, no attempt was made to assess how much information on bird health in backyard poultry farms (which account for ≈95% of the total poultry population in Mali) actually reached EPIVET-Mali veterinarians and technicians. Therefore, we quantifi ed reporting of clinical signs of avian diseases, especially those suggesting HPAI, by poultry owners in Mali. We used a pilot-tested standardized quantitative and qualitative questionnaire to conduct face-toface interviews in 32 randomly selected villages in the southern half of Mali (which accounts for 98% of the poultry population). In each village, we conducted interviews in 4 randomly chosen households. No eligibility criteria were used for household selection because all village households had poultry. Interviews were repeated 6 times (approximately every 3 months) during November 2009-February 2011 in the same villages and whenever possible in the same households. If it was not possible to repeat an interview in a previously interviewed household (absence of the household chief), the neighboring household was interviewed. For each household, data were collected on number of sick and dead birds in the previous 3 months, clinical signs observed, and their notifi cation or lack thereof to veterinary authorities. Households in which birds showed >3 of the following clinical signs (diarrhea, respiratory disorder, nervous signs, cyanosis of the combs or wattles, and mortality rate >50%) were considered as having clinical signs suggesting HPAI. The study was approved by the Direction Nationale des Services Vétérinaires and traditional authorities in all 32 villages, and oral consent was obtained from the poultry owners before interviews. A total of 110-128 households were investigated at each study interval, depending on village accessibility and presence or absence of household chiefs  (Table) . We conducted 738 household investigations in 152 households (80 households were interviewed 6 times, 26 fi ve times, 11 four times, 21 three times, 7 two times, and 7 one time). Observation of sick poultry in the 3 months before the interview was reported in 44.6% of household investigations, and observation of signs suggesting HPAI was reported in 12.2%  (Table) . Notifi cation of veterinary authorities was reported in 13.5% of household investigations with sick poultry and in 17.4% of household investigations with signs suggesting HPAI  (Table) . When we considered the 80 households interviewed 6 times, observation of sick poultry and signs suggesting HPAI varied over time (p = 0.043 and p = 0.018, respectively, by Cochran Q test), whereas variation over time could not be tested for notifi cation because of an insuffi cient number of observations. When we considered all 738 household investigations as independent investigations, observation of sick poultry and signs suggesting HPAI varied over time (p = 0.008 and p<0.001, respectively, by χ 2 test), but reporting of sick poultry did not vary over time (p = 0.06, by χ 2 test). Reporting of signs of HPAI could not be tested. These results illustrate gaps in reporting signs suggesting HPAI by backyard poultry owners. Although these signs could also be those of Newcastle disease, which is present in Mali  (2) , these signs should be reported because HPAI and Newcastle disease are offi cially targeted by EPIVET-Mali. One survey attempted to similarly quantify the level of HPAI reporting in Africa. In Kwara State in Nigeria, 56.5% of respondents indicated that they would not notify offi cials if they suspected HPAI in their fl ocks (3). Reluctance of poultry owners to comply with notifi cation and culling obligations has also been reported in Indonesia  (4) . Several studies that assessed knowledge and practices of poultry workers with regard to avian infl uenza have been conducted in different countries, including developing countries (5,6). These studies were useful for better defi ning content of risk mitigation advice messages and the audience they should primarily target. In our survey, occurrence of disease in Mali varied over time, which was expected because of the seasonal pattern of many avian diseases, especially Newcastle disease, in western Africa (7). However, reporting of sick poultry did not vary over time despite seasonality of activities in rural areas. Lack of awareness of who to report to, fatalistic attitudes toward animal diseases, and mistrust toward the government and its compensation schemes are among the major constraints affecting the likelihood of HPAI signs being reported (3,6,8). However, approaches associating socioanthropology and epidemiology have recently been developed to help solve the problem posed by defi cient reporting (9).

 Myxozoan Parasite in Brain of Critically Endangered Frog To the Editor: More than three quarters of critically endangered species of amphibians are threatened by infectious disease; several are already extinct  (1) . In 2010, the yellow-spotted bell frog (Litoria castanea), which was presumed to be extinct, was rediscovered in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia. This species of frog had not been seen for 30 years, and a chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, was thought to be the reason  (1, 2) . The number of frogs in the rediscovered population is estimated to be 100; if numbers are that low, the yellow-spotted bell frog is the most critically endangered frog in Australia. Several yellow-spotted bell frogs were collected for a captive breeding program at Taronga Zoo in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Generalized edema developed in a subadult male frog after 8 months of captivity in strict quarantine conditions. The frog subsequently died, and later an adult male frog was also found dead. Results of necropsy on both frogs at the Australian Registry of Wildlife Health revealed subcutaneous edema, intracoelomic fl uid, and swollen kidneys with pale foci. Histopathologic examination demonstrated chronic severe tubulonephropathy and acute severe encephalomalacia. Coalescing foci of hemorrhage and malacia were observed in the caudal brainstem and were associated with small multinucleated (1 × 1 μm) parasites forming plasmodia-like structures 10-20 μm in diameter  (Figure) . Plasmodia were present in large numbers  (1-5/40×  fi eld) in the spinal cord. Organisms that were morphologically consistent with myxozoan parasites detected in other frogs in Australia were found predominately within axons and were uncommonly present in vascular endothelial cells (3). Characteristic hepatic lesions, including lymphoplasmacytic hepatitis with biliary hyperplasia and loss of hepatocytes, were also present. The cause of death was renal failure, a common problem in aged frogs; however, these frogs were young, and therefore the cause of the renal changes was perplexing. We considered whether toxins (e.g., improperly cured polyvinyl chloride glue) or an infectious process might be possible causes. Staff in the zoo's breeding program were questioned and indicated that the opportunity for introduction of a toxin was low. In addition, results for virus isolation and fungal and bacterial cultures were negative. We retrospectively reexamined histologic sections of an endangered booroolong frog (Litoria booroolongensis) that had similar brain lesions and intralesional myxozoan parasites (3). Tissue samples were submitted to the Faculty of Veterinary Science, The University of Sydney, for identifi cation. DNA was extracted from brain tissues (20 mg) by using the PureLink DNA Kit (Invitrogen, Mulgrave, Victoria, Australia). To test for myxozoans, we used a highly Myxozoa-specifi c PCR to amplify the complete internal transcribed spacer of the ribosomal DNA (3). Myxozoanpositive amplicons were directly sequenced at Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, South Korea), analyzed by using the CLC Main Workbench (CLC bio, Aahrus, Denmark), and deposited in GenBank (accession nos. JN977605-09). PCR produced a 973-bp amplicon with DNA from brain and liver of the yellow-spotted bell frogs and the booroolong frog. DNA from the frogs showed 100% identity with each other, as did sequences from brain and liver. A BLASTN  (4)

To the Editor: In response to infl uenza outbreaks caused by highly pathogenic avian infl uenza virus (HPAIV) throughout western Africa as of 2006, the National Veterinary Epidemiologic Surveillance Network of Mali (EPIVET-Mali) started conducting domestic and wild bird surveillance. No HPAI outbreaks were reported to the World Organisation for Animal Health. An evaluation survey conducted in 2009 enabled identifi cation and correction of some weaknesses in the organization and functioning of the network 7. Belkahla N, Kchir H, Maamouri N,

Characterizing the interface between wild ducks and poultry to evaluate the potential of transmission of avian pathogens. International Journal of Health Geographics, 10 (60) : 9 p..  http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1476-072X-10-60",22,20120306,Characterizing the interface between wild ducks and poultry to evaluate the potential of transmission of avian pathogens,,"Background A large proportion (72%) of zoonotic emerging infectious diseases originate from wildlife, and most of the emerging disease hotspots are in tropical areas  [1] . The wildlifelivestock interface is therefore of major interest because domestic animals are the most likely link between wildlife reservoirs and humans  [2] . The wildlife-livestock interface is also of major interest for the study of economically important animal diseases like poultry diseases  [3] . Research efforts on the wildlife-livestock interface are needed to better understand and control animal and zoonotic infectious diseases involving wildlife  [4] . Characterizing the spatiotemporal interactions between wild and domestic animals is a key improvement of our knowledge of epidemiological dynamics  [5] . The contact rate between wild and domestic hosts is one of the key parameters of the transmission of pathogens. Most of mathematical models of disease transmission have included β as a unique parameter that describes transmission  [6] . β combines different effects of measurable biological parameters including the contact rate between hosts and the probability that contact events actually result in disease transmission  [7] . Field assessments that accurately estimate the contact rate between hosts could improve estimates of β and the quality of epidemiological models, thereby supporting better predictions of disease dynamics. Characterizing the contact between wild and domestic is now facilitated by recent technologies such as satellite telemetry and remote sensing. However, few studies have combined such advanced spatial tools to quantify the contact rates between wild and domestic hosts at high spatial and temporal resolution. Both direct and indirect contacts may lead to disease transmission. Direct contact requires that two hosts share the same space for a period of time that allows transmission of the pathogen. In contrast, indirect contact requires the survival of the pathogen in the environment for a period of time before infecting a new host. Indirect contact rates between wild and domestic animals are a function of the habitats they share during a period of time when the pathogen survives in the environment. Indirect contacts are a common way of transmission for major poultry diseases like avian influenza and Newcastle disease  [8, 9] . For free-living animals, animal observation  [10]  and telemetry  [11]  have been used to evaluate the direct contact rate between wild and domestic ungulates and canids. New technologies like proximity loggers provide new solutions to estimate direct contact rates between individuals  [12] . In contrast, assessment of indirect contacts has been the subject of comparatively few studies. Seasonal factors related to host populations or the environment are important drivers of disease dynamics  [13] , because they modify the transmission of infectious diseases and subsequent circulation  [14] . Seasonality is a key element to consider in understanding space-time patterns of transmission of an endemic disease or to assess the risk of introduction of an exotic one  [15, 16] . Seasonal patterns have a strong influence on diseases circulating in wildlife, because key ecological traits like migrating or breeding are often timed to particular seasons of their annual cycle  [17] . Thus, estimating seasonal variation of indirect contacts between hosts is critical to understanding the likelihood of disease transmission. The main objective of this paper is to propose a method combining advanced spatial tools to characterize the wildlife-livestock interface. In order to estimate seasonal variation of indirect contact rates, we combined satellite tracking and remote sensing data to develop an indicator of spatiotemporal dynamics between wild ducks and domestic poultry in a tropical wetland. GPS satellite tracking provides numerous accurate locations for estimating contact rates of a limited number of individuals since it is very costly. The method we propose can be used at a local scale with a limited number of transmitters. However its results should not been extrapolated to other areas unless a consequent number of satellite transmitters is deployed. We applied our method to assess the potential indirect contacts between comb ducks (Sarkidiornis melanotos melanotos) and poultry in the Inner Niger Delta (IND) in Mali. Both comb ducks and chickens have been tested positive for avian influenza viruses during the dry season in 2008  [18, 19] . We ran our analysis every 8 days for successive periods during the study (a total of 15 consecutive 8-day periods from February to July 2007). For each period, our analysis included: i) estimating the spatial distribution of chickens based on investigations in villages, ii) modeling the spatial distribution of wild birds by combining satellite telemetry data of comb ducks and remotely sensed environmental indicators, and iii) identifying areas of potential indirect contact between chickens and wild birds. Concurrently, we compared the distribution of comb ducks and natural ponds to understand their use of the different types of habitat available in the area (mainly natural ponds, flooded plains and irrigated areas). Comb ducks are mostly using natural ponds as roosting sites during the day  [20] . After these natural ponds dry out during the dry season, we expected the comb ducks to switch to other habitats, including irrigated areas in the vicinity of villages. This could increase the potential contacts between wild and domestic birds. 
 Results 
 Distribution of Poultry and Wild Birds 
 Distribution of poultry Results from our investigations were consistent across all 21 villages investigated in the area and provided three main points: first, most poultry are chickens and they are kept in different households in the village during the night but are free-ranging together during the day; second, they use habitats within a 500 meters around villages during the day; and third, chicken dispersal pattern is consistent across the dry and the wet seasons. Thus, we considered a village as a relatively stable epidemiological unit for chickens. The spatial distribution of chickens incorporated the extent of the village at night but increased to include a 500-meter buffer during the day (Additional file 1 figure S1). We used the same spatial distribution for all 8-day periods. 
 Distribution of wild birds The four birds marked with satellite transmitters were tracked during 191 days between 14 February during the dry season and 23 August during the rainy season. We obtained 5, 200 GPS locations, i.e. an average of 9 locations per day per bird  (Table 1) . Birds stayed in a relatively small area (70 km × 55 km) during the dry season and into the beginning of the rainy season  (Figure 1 ). They made extensive movements during the middle of the rainy season to reach breeding areas outside of the Inner Niger Delta (IND)  (Figure 1 ). The model of the spatial distribution of the comb ducks in the study area fits the GPS data well, and the training area under the curve (AUC) ranged from 0.820 to 0.998 (mean = 0.95, sd = 0.05) for the 15 successive 8day periods. The indicators that contributed most to the fit of the model were distance to flooded vegetation with a mean contribution of 63% (sd = 16%) and NDVI with a mean contribution of 23% (sd = 17%). The probability maps indicated two different gridcell spatial patterns depending on the season (  Figure 2 ). The number of cells identified as suitable by the model decreased during the dry season, but it increased toward the end of the dry season into the beginning of the rainy season (day 145-177) before the birds dispersed from the study area. 
 Potential indirect contact between poultry and wild birds Field measurements revealed that ponds and rivers in the IND were composed of freshwater with a pH close to 7 that ranged from 25°C to 35°C. Depending on the season, the survival of most strains of AIV and NDV in the environment was likely to be longer than a few days  [8, [21] [22] [23] [24] . Although chickens only used the water bodies during the day, they could be infected by comb ducks that used those same habitats during the night. We recorded an indirect contact when a suitable model cell was in the chickens dispersal range (i.e. within 500 meters of a village). To quantify potential contacts between chickens and comb ducks, we calculated the number of villages in the area modelled as suitable for comb ducks for each 8-day period (  Figure 3 ). The proportion of villages of the study area in potential contact with comb ducks decreases during the dry season  (Figure 3 ). However, we observed. a period with increased  potential contacts at the end of the dry season into the beginning of the rainy season (  Figure 3 ). 
 Correspondence between wild birds and natural ponds The overlay correspondence between wild birds and natural ponds distributions varied temporally with the suitability threshold (  Figure 4 ). Moderate (0.4 < kappa ≤ 0.6) to high agreement (kappa > 0.8) calculated for different thresholds indicated that natural ponds were suitable habitats for comb ducks. For all suitability thresholds (results for 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 are displayed in  Figure 4 ), agreement between suitable cells and natural ponds increased until the end of the dry season indicating that the birds were increasingly using natural ponds as the dry season progressed. Conversely, agreement was very low (kappa ≤ 0.2) at the end of the dry season into the beginning of the rainy season before birds left the study area. The two main results are therefore that, first comb ducks are increasingly using natural ponds during the dry season which may be due to the drying out of other types of habitats like flooding plains, and second comb ducks switched to other type of habitats than natural pond at the end of the dry season. They could use irrigated areas or other artificial wetlands after the drying out of the natural ponds. 
 Conclusions Our results showed that satellite telemetry and remote sensing data may be combined to model indicators of key epidemiological parameters and their temporal variability with high spatial and temporal resolution. We were able to quantify seasonal variation in locations and timing of potential indirect contacts between wild ducks and chickens. We identified a critical period at the beginning of the rainy season that may have the highest potential for transmission and spread of pathogens in the IND due to regional movement. Our method can therefore be implemented at a local scale to assess the potential contacts at the wildlife-livestock interface in remote tropical areas. The potential for contacts between comb ducks and chickens during the dry season may be explained by environmental dynamics. We observed that correspondence between predicted suitable cells for comb ducks and natural ponds increased during the dry season indicating that wild birds were likely increasingly using natural ponds. Dessication of these natural ponds in the vicinity of villages explains lower predicted contacts with chickens during the dry season. At the end of the dry season and the beginning of the rainy season, the agreement between predicted habitat used by comb ducks and natural ponds is very low (kappa < 0.2) indicating that the birds stopped using these habitats when they dried out. Wild birds moved to smaller ponds or irrigated areas during this period, increasing potential contacts with chickens. The potential spread of pathogens by comb ducks is related to drivers leading to regional movements of wild birds at the beginning of the rainy season. Two main factors influenced the movement behaviour of comb ducks. First, refilling of many water bodies with seasonal rainfall led to the emergence of areas rich in food resources surrounding the IND  [25] . Second, the breeding behaviour of the birds influenced their movements. Comb ducks, as many other tropical waterbirds species, breed mainly during the rainy season  [20] . Their breeding sites, remote water bodies or flooded forests, are the only favourable habitats during the rainy season. The use of favourable habitats for both feeding and breeding during the rainy season led to regional movements that increased the potential spread of avian-borne pathogens by wild birds. Validation and extrapolation of our results are limited by the type of data and the relatively small sample size used in our study. No validation (e.g cross-validation) method was convenient due to the spatial auto-correlation of the GPS data. We only showed the training AUC automatically calculated by Maxent. But a careful interpretation of these good scores of AUC (mean = 0.95, sd = 0.05) is required. First, AUC can be criticized for its reliability to accurately assess the performance of niche models  [26, 27] . And second, the spatial-autocorrelation of our data likely leads to an overestimation of the performance of the model. The absoltute value of potential contact rate estimated in this study would be hard to generalize to other species or other ecosystems due to the limited number of individuals from a single species we could monitored. Although we obtained numerous detailed GPS locations on four individuals, these individuals may have only represented movements of only one sub-population as the four tagged comb ducks went to the same pond in the study area. However, a field observation a year after the release of the tagged birds showed this pond was a major roosting for comb ducks and white-faced whistling ducks. One would expect birds from different family groups to congregate on this   pond with other groups. Furthermore, the behaviour of the tagged comb ducks was in compliance with what is known about their ecology and what local hunters reported during our field work: they congregated on the remnant water bodies during the dry season and performed a regional movement to reach different breeding grounds during the rainy season  [20, 28] . That is why we believe these results can be extrapolated to other wild ducks in the study area. However, we would not extrapolate our results to other African wetlands without deploying more satellite transmitters in these areas. Studies with more transmitters would be more informative but their cost could be a major limitation. We believe that our study with few transmitters is interesting to locally assess the potential contacts between wild birds and chickens, and can be easily implemented, even in remote areas  [29] . Contact rate between hosts, being either direct or indirect, is one of the main parameters of the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. However several other parameters may modulate the probability for a contact to produce an effective transmission of pathogen. First, transmission is likely to be influenced by the density of hosts  [13] . Evidence of density-dependent transmission of avian influenza has been shown for wild birds  [30, 31] . Second, transmission depends on the probability that the contact occurs between a susceptible and an infected hosts. Consequently, the proportion of infected hosts in the population and the level of population immunity are crucial parameters  [17] . Finally, the duration of persistence of the pathogen in the environment will control the probability of transmission. This is particularly true for water-borne transmitted viruses like AIV for which temperature, pH, and salinity may reduce the duration of survival and infectivity of the virus in the environment  [8, 21, 22, 24] . Therefore, one has to consider the possibility that the period with the greatest contact rate between wild and domestic hosts may not be a period of maximum transmission. In classical SIR models, transmission parameters are usually assembled in the parameter β  [6] . Different components of the β could be considered separately, like contact rate and transmission rate. Estimating and modelling these two distinct components of the β separately should provide a better understanding of the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. It would also allow the use of a direct measure of these parameters rather than estimating a global β, which is usually the case  [32] . Our main results, the proportion of villages in potential contact with comb ducks, may be used to refine a seasonal forcing of the contact rate. In a SIR model with a density-dependent transmission, the force of infection λ would be expressed as: λ(t) = p(t) × β.I/N where p(t) is the proportion of villages in potential contact with comb ducks as a function of time, β is the probability that a domestic bird is infected with AIV following contact with a wild bird, I is the number of infected wild birds, and N is the size of the wild bird population  [7, 33] . Thus, our method could potentially be integrated into epidemiological models aiming to take into account the dynamic of contact rates between hosts. It would improve the efficiency of these models when contact rates are explicit parameters of the models  [34] . Finally, our approach could be used to identify the villages with an increased risk of indirect contact with wild ducks. This would allow implementing risk-based surveillance in areas by targeting the villages with the highest risk of contact. 
 Methods 
 The Inner Niger Delta The Inner Niger Delta (IND) in Mali is the largest continental wetland in West Africa and the second largest in Africa. Stretching over 41, 195 km 2 in the midst of the Sahelian zone, this low elevation floodplain area includes a number of seasonally inundated lakes, ponds and river channels. Over one million people live in the area with their domestic animals. The IND is a key West African wetland and supports many wild birds species including up to one million migrating Palearctic ducks during the northern winter, 100, 000 Afro-tropical ducks, and 300, 000 waders of various origins  [35] . The ecology of the area is mainly driven by the flood level, which itself depends on rainfall in the region  [36] . After the rainy season (June to September) the area is flooded for several months (September to December), decreasing in water level in the following months when aggregations of waterbirds are found on the remnant water bodies (lakes and natural ponds) that are also used by people and chickens. The mixing of wild waterbirds and chickens provides favourable conditions for transmission of avian-borne pathogens like avian influenza viruses (AIV) or Newcastle disease viruses (NDV). 
 Distribution of Poultry and Wild Birds Distribution of Poultry To document the distribution of poultry in the IND, we conducted investigations in 18 of the 64 villages in the area and collected information about the maximal distance of scavenging by poultry around villages. We developed a questionnaire comprising several questions about the poultry populations, husbandry and movements among the villages. The questionnaire was used in all villages investigated and the same procedure was applied in all villages involving each time a meeting with the village leader. 
 Wild birds Satellite telemetry data On 17 February 2007, we deployed 30g solar-powered Platform Terminal Transmitters (PTTs; Microwave Telemetry Inc., Columbia, MD, USA) on four comb ducks (Sarkidiornis melanotos) at Barnajee (15.22°N, 4.31°W) in the IND  (Figure 1) . We selected the comb duck for its potential to spread pathogens regionally, in particular for AIV for which comb ducks had been tested positive in the Inner Niger Delta in 2006  [37] . It is a large African duck known to perform extensive intra-African movements, including trans-equatorial migration  [20] , and it breeds during the rainy season in sub-Saharan Africa. The PTT was < 3% of the bird's body mass  [19] , and we used an attachment technique  [18]  similar to the one described by Miller et al.  [38]  which proved successful in North America for tracking northern pintail (Anas acuta) during migration. Location data were uploaded via the Argos Data Collection and Location System (CLS, Toulouse, France) to receivers aboard polar-orbiting weather satellites. In order to conserve battery power, the PTTs were programmed to transmit data in a duty cycle of 6 hours every 2 days (48 h). The PTTs logged GPS locations every two hours when they had sufficient stored power from the solar panel with a mean accuracy estimated at ± 18.5 m. We only considered locations transmitted at least 15 days after the release of the birds, in order to discard any aberrant movements associated with capture, handling and harness attachment  [39] . 
 Environmental data The IND is a remote area with a rapid environmental dynamic due to the seasonal flooding. In order to capture the space-time dynamics of environmental conditions, we used remotely sensed indicators from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor which provides a good trade-off between spatial (250 m or 500 m cells depending on bands) and temporal resolution (8 days). Different indicators have been developed to remotely monitor water bodies, whether open water or flooded areas  [40] . We selected one indicator of vegetation and one indicator of water, because they are the two main environmental factors most likely to be related to the distribution of wild waterbirds. We used the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)  [41] , the most commonly used vegetation indicator, to assess vegetation. We used the Modified Normalised Difference Water Index (MNDWI)  [42] , found to be one of the most efficient water indicators, to monitor temporary ponds over large areas of arid lands  [43] . These two indicators were available with a 250 m spatial resolution and an 8-day temporal resolution. We also created vegetation and water indicators to quantify their dynamics. These two other indicators were differences between the value of the NDVI or the MNDWI for the 8-day period considered compared with the value of the same indicator 24 days before. Finally, we used a fifth indicator, the distance to flooded vegetation, because we expected that the spatial distribution of wild waterfowl would be related to ponds with flooded vegetation, and there would likely be strong interaction between the NDVI and the MNDWI. High values of NDVI could be related to favourable habitat for waterbirds when associated with high values of MNDWI, indicating flooded vegetation used by waterbirds. On the other hand, high values of NDVI could also be related with non-favourable habitat when associated with low values of MNDWI, indicating terrestrial vegetation not used by waterbirds. This fifth indicator was calculated as the distance to the closest cell identified as flooded vegetation. A cell was considered to contain flooded vegetation when its NDVI value was greater than v = 0.2 and its MNDWI value was greater than w = -0.3 (see Additional file 1 for the determination of v and w). 
 Distribution modelling of wild birds We used the maximum entropy (Maxent version 3.3.2) method developed by Philips et al  [44]  and adapted for ecological applications by Elith et al  [45]  to determine suitable habitats for comb ducks in the study area based on our environmental indicators and satellite tracking data. Maxent is a machine-learning method for making predictions or inferences from incomplete information. It was selected, because it is one of the most accurate methods for predicting species distribution  [46] , it is well adapted to satellite tracking studies providing presence-only data, and it can be run with limited training data. For all 15 consecutive 8-day periods, we ran the model to predict the probability of presence of comb ducks in the study area using 500 iterations of the Maxent sequential-update algorithm. Because of the auto-correlation between the GPS locations, no cross-validation was undertaken. Any subset of GPS points for training or testing the model would be very similar to the full dataset, leading to an overestimation of the model performance. We trained the model with all locations in the study area for all birds and the five environmental variables corresponding to an 8-day period. The model provided us with a time series of probability maps where comb ducks were present in the study area. 
 Indirect contact between poultry and wild birds An indirect contact may be defined when two hosts share the same space during a period of time corresponding to the survival of the pathogen in the environment. The survival in water of both AIVs and NDVs depends on temperature, pH and salinity  [8, 21, 22, 24] . To determine the potential of indirect contact between poultry and wild birds for these two pathogens, we considered for each 8day period the spatial distribution of both poultry and wild birds, the timing of poultry and wild birds in these areas, and the estimated survival time of the pathogens in the environment depending on temperature, pH, and salinity. 
 Correspondence between wild birds and natural pond distributions We compared the spatial distribution of comb ducks with the spatial distribution of natural ponds to understand how comb ducks use the different habitats available in the study areas. Three main habitats are available for comb ducks, natural ponds, flooded plains, and artificial wetlands like irrigated areas. Natural ponds are well delimated water bodies (as opposed to flood plains) that are naturally flooded by rainfall or by the global flooding of the Inner Niger Delta(as opposed to water bodies flooded by men like irrigated areas). These different habitats have different dynamics that may influence the spatial distribution of comb ducks. We focused on the correspondence between wild birds spatial distribution and natural pond distribution because natural ponds can be easily spatially delimited and because we expected natural ponds to be the main habitat used by comb ducks. We did not expect perfect concurrence of comb duck spatial distribution and natural pond spatial distribution, because comb ducks also use other habitats like flooded plains or irrigated areas. Based on observations conducted during a field mission in March 2008 and on Google Earth™ images, we determined the location of the main natural ponds in the study area (Additional file 1  figure S1 ). We calculated a Cohen-Kappa coefficient  [47]  to evaluate the agreement between the probability of presence of comb ducks predicted by the model and the spatial distribution of the natural ponds. We used a sample of 200 cells of our study area to measures the agreement between the predicted distribution of the comb ducks (characterized by cells predicted as suitable by the model) and the distribution of the natural ponds (characterized by cells in which were observed natural ponds). For each 8-day period and for different suitability threshold, we randomly sampled 100 cells with a probability greater than the suitability threshold (suitable cells), and 100 cells with a probability lower than the suitability threshold (unsuitable cells). The suitability threshold is the value of the probability of presence predicted by the model above which a cell is considered suitable for comb ducks. This suitability threshold ranges from 0 to 1. When less than 100 suitable cells were available for analyses, we used all available suitable cells and an equivalent number of unsuitable cells. A high agreement would indicate that comb ducks are using natural ponds as their main habitat. Lower agreement would indicate that comb ducks are using other types of habitats, like flooded plains or irrigated areas. 
 Additional material Additional file 1: Construction of the fifth indicator and additional figures. This file explains how was built the fifth environmental indicator used as an explanatory variable in our distribution model. We describe the two steps and the optimisation process leading to the variable called 'distance to flooded vegetation areas suitable for wild birds'. The files also contains  figure S1  showing the 64 villages and the natural ponds and lakes included in the study area, and  figure S2  showing typical result of the optimisation process used to build the fifth environmental indicator. Figure 1 1 Map of the Inner Niger Delta in West Africa and movements of four comb ducks tracked with satellite transmitters. Marked ducks were tracked for up to 191 days and provided 5, 200 locations or an average 9 locations per day per transmitter. 
 Figure 2 2 Predicted spatial distribution of the comb ducks in the study area. This figure shows a time series of maps of the probability of presence of the comb ducks in the study area for different 8-day periods. The probability of presence was estimated by the Maxent model run for each 8-day period with five remotely sensed indicators and the satellite tracking data of the comb ducks in the study area. After the beginning of the rainy season, all the birds have left the study area to reach their breeding grounds, explaining why no suitable area is predicted by the model for the last 8-day period (Days 177 to 184). The sun icons indicate the dry season while the rainy cloud icons indicate the rainy season. 
 Figure 3 3 Proportion of villages in potential contact with comb ducks. This proportion is given for three different values (lines) of a suitability threshold. This threshold is the value of the predicted probability of presence above which a cell is considered as suitable for the comb ducks by the distribution model. The bars indicate the rainfall for the 8-day period. The light blue background indicates the rainy season. 
 Figure 4 4 Correspondence between areas predicted as suitable for comb ducks and natural ponds in the study area. The correspondence is estimated by the Cohen's kappa value for three different values of a suitability threshold. This threshold is the value of the predicted probability of presence above which a cell is considered as suitable for the comb ducks by the distribution model. The light grey background indicates the rainy season.

We combined theoretical computational models, laboratory experiments with undergraduate students in the USA, field experiments and role games with villagers in rural Thailand and Colombia. We discuss the methodological challenges experienced in combining the different methods, as well as resulting methodological innovations. For example, the practice of field experiments and role games was adjusted after the investigators, who had experience with different methods, worked together to undertake both field experiments and role games in the same villages. Another example is the development of new laboratory experiments based on observations during field experiments. Moreover, we elaborate on how these methods have led to improved insights into the theoretical framework proposed by  Poteete et al. (2010) . By going back and forth between case studies, experimentation, and formal modeling, we can address specific theoretical puzzles inspired by empirical observations and replicated and disentangled with formal models. The paper ends with lessons learned and methodological challenges ahead to study the fit between institutional arrangements and ecological dynamics. 
 Case study: dynamics of rules An important question with regard to collective action of natural resources is the fit between ecological dynamics and institutional arrangements. How can appropriators craft effective rule structures? A long-term project to address this problem is used here as an example of the use of multiple methods. The project, which started in 2004 for a period of six years, was funded by the National Science Foundation of the USA. The project included scholars from Arizona State University (USA), Indiana University (USA), Universidad de los Andes (Colombia), and Cirad (France). The original aim of the project was to understand how resource users craft effective institutional rules, how these are related to the ecological dynamics and the expertise of the participants. Such information would be of use to develop formal models of institutional change and adaptation, for example in the face of climate change. Since existing experimental work was mainly focused on comparing the effects of one institutional arrangement versus another, not how participants crafted rules, new experiments needed to have designs in which the rulecrafting could be observed more closely and that would generate new data that could be used to develop formal models. From the start, the project aimed to include laboratory experiments with undergraduate students, field experiments, and role games with villagers in Colombia and Thailand. These countries were chosen because of existing contacts with an experimental economist, Juan-Camilo Cardenas, who had performed many field experiments in Colombia, and a modeler of social-ecological systems, François Bousquet, who had combined role games and agent-based modeling in Southeast Asia. Other investigators in the project were faculty from diverse disciplines at Indiana University, namely cognitive scientist Robert Goldstone, computer scientist Filippo Menczer, and political scientist Elinor Ostrom. The principal investigator, Marco Janssen, is an applied mathematician, who moved to Arizona State University during the project. All investigators were familiar with the details of some of the methods, but not with all. During the beginning of the project, the investigators needed to get familiar enough with each other's method to start designing experiments. Building upon an existing experimental environment developed by Goldstone  (Goldstone and Ashpole, 2004) , new laboratory experiments were developed in which participants experienced spatial and temporal dynamics. Inclusion of those dimensions was important since meta-analysis of field studies has shown that these are critical to distinguish different types of institutional arrangements  (Schlager et al., 1994) . With these laboratory experiments, microsituational variables could be manipulated and rule-crafting could be observed, especially when communications could be recorded because participants were using text-based chat rooms . Using high-resolution experimental data, agent-based models could be tested in a rigorous way  (Janssen et al., 2009) . The field experiments and role games went through two years of preparation before the first experiments could be performed. Due to differences in methodologies used by the various investigators, new problems needed to be solved if both experiments and role games could be performed in all six villages in two different countries. Experiments went through a series of tests at the lab and then in the field. Once the protocol was written in English, it was translated in Thai and Spanish. It was then reviewed and approved by the institutional review board to ensure that human subjects are treated ethically and that their rights and welfare are adequately protected. This preparation of experiments and role games led to innovations for field experiments  (Cardenas et al., to appear) . For the first time, this project combined role games and field experiments. Having the villagers first participate in field experiments, and then, later, adjust the field experiments into role games in line with their local context, represented innovations in the methodology of role games. Some laboratory experiments performed later in the project were based on experiences derived from the field experiments. For example, an irrigation game characterized by asymmetry of access to the resource led participants in field experiments to balance efficiency (investment in infrastructure) and equity (allocation of water). This was translated into a downloading game in a laboratory experiment with a similar payoff structure, and similar findings  (Janssen et al., to appear) . In the laboratory experiments, communication was allowed, which resulted in higher levels of cooperation and coordination over the rounds. There was more variability in the outcomes for the field experiments. The experimental designs that came out of this project would not have been possible if it had focused on one methodology. Scholars familiar with different methods who were challenging each other led to innovative designs that other scholars are now beginning to adopt. We now discuss in more detail some of the results from the project before we discuss the implications for methodology and theory. 
 Laboratory experiments The main research question related to performing laboratory experiments was what kind of rules would participants choose in different types of resource ecologies. In doing so, we have developed a new experimental environment that includes more relevant ecological dynamics than traditional experiments. Unlike previous experiments that utilize static, one-shot, or repeated interactions to investigate these issues, we investigate a real-time dynamic resource-harvesting setting. The software used for this experiment is open-source and available at http://commons.asu.edu. Participants appropriate renewable tokens from a shared renewable resource environment  (Fig. 1 ). In our experiments, groups of four or five share a few hundred cells. In order to collect a token, a participant must position their avatar on the location of that token and explicitly press the space bar. Each token harvested is worth $0.02 USD. Participants have complete information on the spatial position of tokens and can watch the harvesting actions of other group members in real time. Empty cells have the potential to generate new tokens each second. The probability that a given empty cell will generate a token is density-dependent on the number of adjacent cells with tokens. The probability p t is linearly related to the number of neighbors: p t = p * n t /N where n t is the number of neighboring cells containing a green token, N (= 8) is the number of neighboring cells, and p = 0.01 or 0.02. If an empty cell is completely surrounded by eight tokens, it will generate a token at a higher probability than an empty cell that abuts only three tokens. At least one adjacent cell must contain a token for a new token generation to occur. Therefore, if participants appropriate all of the tokens on the screen, they have exhausted the resource and no additional token generation will occur. By designing the environment in this manner, we capture a key characteristic of many spatially dependent renewable resources. The optimum level of appropriation depends on the initial starting conditions and probabilistic renewal of the empty cells. If we ignore the spatial variability, the optimal strategy is derived by keeping the resource at a 50% density and all tokens are harvested during the last second of the experiment. Before we discuss a series of experiments in more detail, we first discuss the initial sets of experiments. In , the effect of an endogenous rule change from open access to private property is examined as a potential solution to overharvesting in commons dilemmas. Five participants share a common resource and could not communicate. When they got the option to invest in private property in the second round of the experiment, half of the participants did. If a majority in a group invested in the option of private property, this option was implemented. Otherwise, the common-pool resource situation remained. Groups who had experienced private property in the second round of the experiment, made different decisions in the third round when open access was reinstituted in contrast to groups who experienced two rounds of open access. At the group level, earnings increased in round 3, but this was at a cost of more inequality. No significant differences in outcomes occurred between experiments where rules were imposed by the experimental design or chosen by participants. When we included face-to-face communication, we observed informal arrangements to divide up space and slow down the harvesting rate in various ways . We observed that experienced participants, who had participated in an earlier experiment, in the study above, where private property was used as one way of controlling harvesting in this renewable resource environment, are more effective in creating rules, although they mimic the private-property regime of their prior experience. Inexperienced participants need an extra round to reach the same level of resource use, but they craft a diverse set of novel rule sets. The third set of experiments is reported in  Janssen (2010) . In this study, we used an updated version of the experimental software using a square-shaped environment, like  Figure 1 , with four participants. We included a first round where a resource could be harvested by just one participant to confirm that participants avoid overharvesting if they do not share the resource. We also designed each round to last for four minutes. We communicated the length of the round to the participants to avoid that rapid overharvesting is caused by the uncertainty of the duration of a round. After the individual round, four participants are randomly matched, leading each and every time to a rapid collapse of the resource. We continued the experiment for three rounds in which we allowed communication via text messages, chat, for five minutes. We were interested in the effect of communication and the type of rules they crafted. The earnings improved significantly with the allowance of communication. Text analysis shows that participants create informal institutions that define when, where, and how to appropriate the resource and this varies with the ecological dynamics in the different treatments. These treatments differ by the regeneration rate, and spatial heterogeneity vs. homogeneity of the resource regeneration rate. The informal arrangements focus on several possibilities: (1) dividing up the space into four areas, (2) waiting or not to harvest at the start of the round, and (3) how many seconds before the end of the round can the rules be ignored so as to collect all the remaining tokens. By analyzing the content of all messages and coding them into twenty different categories, we find that the amount and distribution of communication messagesnot the content of the communication -explain the differences between group performances. The first three studies showed that participants are able to craft rules to avoid the tragedy of the commons. We also gained sufficient experience with this new experimental environment to be ready to use it to test the recent findings in experimental economics that costly punishment increases gross earnings. We include costly punishment by allowing participants to click on the number of the avatar, which reduces their own earning by one token and the other participant's earning by two tokens. We performed a number of experiments in which we varied whether we start with communication and/or costly sanctioning for three rounds, or end with it (Tab. 1). Our experiments show, however, that costly punishment is used but lacks a gross positive effect on resource harvesting unless combined with communication .  Figure 2  shows that costly punishment does not lead to a significant change. Communication after three rounds without communication (and costly punishment) increases the earnings, and thus performance. However, if communication and costly punishment are allowed (and used), the earnings drop significantly when communication and punishment are no longer allowed. 
 Field experiments We performed a series of experiments in six rural villages in Thailand and Colombia: three in Thailand and three in Colombia. The villages were selected to represent a dominant resource use of one of the three resource appropriation activities: fishery, forestry, and irrigation. In Thailand, experiments were performed in the Petchaburi watershed, situated in western Thailand, in three separate locations: one in the coastal area, and the other two in inland areas. The Colombian experiments were conducted in three different rural sites. The fishery community is represented by a village on Barú Island, a rural area of Cartagena city on the   Caribbean Coast. The irrigation community is located in the Fúquene Lake basin area, located in the Andean region of Cundinamarca and Boyacá; the forestry community is located on the Pacific Coast tropical forest area. The experiments have been replicated with college students in Bogota and Bangkok. In each village, each of the three resource games were conducted with four groups of five people. As a result, 480 individuals participated in the experiments (see  Tab.  2). We performed three types of games in each village: fishery, forestry, and irrigation. The basic structure was that participants first experienced ten rounds of the game, and then could vote for a rule change. The three types of rules participants could choose from were lottery (random access to the resource), rotation (predefined schedule for when to access the resource), and quota (limited allowable harvest). After the voting, the group continued with the rule they elected. All decisions were made in private. The goal of the experiments was to test how relevant experience with resource management affected the decisions participants made and the rules participants elected. We expected that, for example, a fishery game would be played differently, more cooperatively, by fishers than by foresters and farmers. After each experiment, the players were asked to answer a set of questions on the set of rules (How efficient do you think this rule is for managing the resource? How fair do you think this rule is for managing the resource? How much personal freedom do you think this rule allows you in managing   
 Forestry game The key feature of the forestry game is the renewable component of the stock of timber. The stock is represented as 100 magnets, trees, on a board. In each round, participants can take a maximum of five magnets from the board. The stock will regenerate. For every ten magnets on the board, one magnet is added, with a maximum of 100 magnets. When the stock is below 25 trees, the maximum number of magnets each individual is allowed to extract is indicated in  Table 3 . When participants collect as much as possible as fast as possible, the stock will be depleted in five rounds, and the tokens collected by the group is 119. When they cooperate and maximize, the group earning the group total can increase to 165 for a sequence of ten periods or rounds. The resources are rapidly overharvested in the first ten rounds  (Fig. 3) . After participants have voted for one of the rules (55% voted for rotation, the other two rules split the rest of the votes), the decline of the resource slows down and participants harvest on average 20% more trees. However, due to the frequent rule violations the net earnings did not increase. If we look at the individual-level behavior of the participants, we see that when harvesting is not allowed, 70% break the rule. When a rule is broken, a lower amount of trees is harvested than normal. This leads to a reduction of the harvesting pressure, but due to penalties being paid when caught illegally appropriating trees, the net earnings do not increase. More in-depth statistical analysis reveals that participants who feel less accepted as a member of the community are more likely to break the rules  (Janssen et al., in preparation) . Furthermore, those who have a higher level of trust in others in the community are more likely to break the rule, probably because they trust others will accept the rule breaking, as is usual in these circumstances. We do not find that games played in villages dominated by forestry make different decisions than other villages. 
 Water irrigation game In the irrigation game, participants receive ten tokens each round and must first decide how much to invest in a public fund that generates water for the whole group to share; then each player, in sequential turns from upstream to downstream players, decides how much to extract from the generated water. Each token kept (not invested) has a monetary value for the player and is equal to the value of each unit of water extracted. Participants have positions A, B, C, D, or E, where A has the first choice to harvest water from the common infrastructure. This game includes the dilemma of upstream participants who need the help of downstream participants to generate a favorable size of the common infrastructure. However, the downstream participants can only get benefits from the common infrastructure when upstream participants avoid the temptation to deplete the common resource and leave water for players downstream. Under this asymmetric game, participants first experience a contribution dilemma and then face a resource appropriation dilemma when they extract from the generated resource. In  Table 4 , the water provision generated is defined as a function of the total investments of the five participants. Clearly under these incentives and rules, the Nash equilibrium is that no one invests in the water provision, and all receive ten tokens for a group earnings of  fifty tokens. In the cooperative (social optimum) solution, everyone invests his/her ten tokens in the public good, producing 100 units of income in each round. Therefore, for a sequence of ten rounds, the group earnings would sum 500 tokens and a social optimum could go up to 1 000 tokens. Our experiments show that there is a dynamic interaction between equality in the use of the common resource and the level of the contributions to the creation of a common resource  (Janssen et al., submitted) . The initial levels of investments are explained by the level of trust participants have in other people in the community. Higher levels of trust correlate with higher investments. The investment levels are reasonably stable over the rounds, and systematically lower for students compared to villagers  (Fig. 4) . We also observe a distribution of investments into the public infrastructure that is independent of the position of the participants. However, the level of collected water is unequally distributed  (Fig. 5) . Participants upstream derive a higher share compared to participants downstream. Statistical analysis shows that inequality in the distribution of benefits in one round triggers lower levels of group contributions, reducing efficiency and triggering even more inequality in contributions and distribution of the resource among players  (Janssen et al., submitted) . 
 Fishery game In the fishery game, participants decide each round where to fish and how much effort to exert. There are two locations, A and B, to which they can choose to go. In each location, they can choose to exert low or high levels of effort. There is a slightly higher return from a high effort compared to a low effort (see Tab. 5). The payoff table is the same for both locations, and the initial state of the resource is the high fish availability (Tab. 5). However, when the total effort in a location is five or more units, the state of the fish stock will move to the low availability. This situation can only be reversed when not more than one unit of effort is invested in that location in two consecutive rounds. When participants behave opportunistically, they move to the low state of both resources in two rounds, and get stuck in that situation for the remainder of the rounds. For a sequence of ten rounds, this opportunistic behavior will result in 200 tokens for the fiveperson group. However, if they coordinated their efforts, the cooperative solution leads to 382 tokens by spreading the effort equally over the two resources where at least two people do not exert the maximum effort.  Figure 6  shows the average earnings over the rounds  (Castillo et al., to appear) . The earnings drop quickly due to the state of the resource switch from high to low payoffs. However, the states of the fishing grounds remain low for most of the groups due to persistent high levels of effort. After rules are elected, the flip to the low payoff state was delayed, leading to higher earnings. The pattern is the same for both countries. If we look at all the villages, we find that fishing villages do overharvest more   than other rural villages and significantly more than the student groups. 
 Return visits A year after the field experiments, we returned to the villages to discuss the settings and the results of the experiments. We then started to develop a role game of the experiment that was most relevant for the village  (Castillo, in preparation) . Through a self-construction process, the objective was to assess the type of context that needed to be added for relevant decision making. Given a set of guiding questions, a group of villagers adjusted the experiment to make it more relevant to their situation. Depending on the experiment, they included more ecological complexity (species, spatial heterogeneity), different types of actors (middlemen, industrial fishers), and technology (gear). After a role game was developed, it was played with new participants from the village. Some general lessons can be drawn. For the forestry role-games in both the Colombian and Thai cases, the key driver is the system of economic transaction between the woodcutters and the buyers. The demand for wood drives the harvest effort. For the irrigation role-games, the villagers put the focus on water sharing but did not pay attention to the water-provisioning issue. The problem of provisioning is in fact a stake at a higher organizational level where water is shared among big canals. Locally, the farmers are less concerned. In Thailand, for example, a small group of farmers (about ten) on a common canal share the water according to the different needs. The sharing is collectively decided with the leadership of one farmer who takes the responsibility to visit the higher organizational level when the total amount allocated to the small canal is insufficient. With regards to the fishing villages, return visits have shown that the two ecological contexts are very different. The abundance of fish is poor in Colombia and rich in Thailand. However, in both cases, the fishermen played very competitive roles leading to the ""tragedy of the commons"" pattern. The rationale is: ""what is not caught by me will be caught by others"". From the role games, we can understand that the fishermen brought their own ""reality"" in the field experiment, leading to difficulties for coordination. It also appears that (1) broader context affects cooperation levels at the local scale and (2) high levels of trust among local fishermen are not sufficient for resource sustainability when trust in external rule designers and enforcers is low  (Castillo et al., to appear) . 
 Lessons learned The expectation at the start of the project was that specific experience with resource management would affect the way participants play the game and the rules they would develop. We expected that participants with more relevant experience would achieve higher levels of performance and choose rules that increased the performance more than those groups who had less relevant experience. These expectations have been partly confirmed. Participants in laboratory experiments who were invited to participate a second time crafted effective rules more rapidly in line with previous experiences. In the field experiments, we derived mixed results. In general, the choice of rules did not improve the average earnings of the groups. It is interesting to note that students were more eager to vote for property rights while villagers preferred rotation and lottery types of rules. Although participants could vote for the rules, the three options were chosen by the experimenters and participants might experience those options to be imposed on them. We decided to have the same kind of rule choices for each game and each village in order to compare the outcomes. These rule choices might not have fit the local context in various cases, as shown for instance during return visits to irrigation villages. We found that resource-specific experience led to lower cooperation in the fishery game among fishers. Since fishers in the communities where we performed the experiments expected the other fishers to be highly competitive (as shown earlier), they overharvested the resource more quickly than groups in other villages. When the experimental settings match the reality of the players, like for the fishery, we see that they actually imported their specific experience in the experiments. But this does not mean that they performed better, as in reality they do not perform well at preserving the resource and collectively maximizing their income. We found that contextual variables, such as trust in other community members and the feeling of being an accepted member of the community, had significant explanatory power, more than experience. We included a sophisticated survey, but in hindsight, we should have included more options to measure the contextual variables of the social fabric of the community. Information about power relationships and status of the participants of the games might have been especially useful information. Originally, we expected to have a tighter connection between the field and the laboratory experiments. However, the development cycles of the field and laboratory experiments are quite different. We invested more in software development for the laboratory experiments and started to focus more on communication since the use of text chat provides insightful opportunities. Although software development is slow, one can perform new experiments every year. The development, pretesting, and implementation of field experiments took years. Practical limitations led us to not do many experiments in one community nor to include novel treatments. The results of the field experiments led to many new questions, and we plan to perform a series of laboratory experiments with the design of the field experiments in order to narrow down research questions for future experiments in the field. We found a consistency between lab experiments and role-playing games: when villagers set a role-playing game, they very often create an arena for communication but do not give any orientation on what will be the content of communication  (rules, roles) . This is consistent with the lab experiments, which revealed that the amount of communication are more important than the content of communications. To conclude, our experiments, both the lab and the field, have led to new insights and methodological innovations. Social context seems to be more important than resource-specific knowledge in explaining the behavior in experiments. This confirms the recent focus on conditional cooperation. Participants use information of the social context to determine the types of participants in the game, and behave accordingly. This information might be derived from communication or from knowledge about other community members (in case the group members in the experiment are known, as was the case in field experiments). 
 Capturing context: a framework of collective action In recent years, there has been an increased interest in field experiments and conducting experiments with nontraditional subject pools, such as hunter-gatherers.  Henrich et al. (2010)  focus on cultural differences and market integration that explain different levels of cooperation. Within the same culture, we also see differences in the decisions that participants make in social dilemma games  (Gurven et al., 2008) . We need to move beyond the broad notions of ""culture"" and ""context"" and be more precise in identifying specific attributes.  Poteete et al. (2010)  present an alternative framework of collective action and the commons based on field studies and experiments, and stress the importance of microsituational variables, the broader context, and the relationship between them  (Fig. 1) . The conventional theory was pristine in the simplicity of its model of human behavior. All individuals were thought to be selfish and rational. Individuals were assumed to have complete information about the structure of the situation they are in, including the preferences of other actors, the full range of possible actions, and the probability associated with each outcome resulting from a combination of actions. Decades of fieldwork and experiments emphasized that not all humans behave like selfish rational beings, and that participants do not complete information about all situations of interest to theorists. Furthermore, alternative formal modeling approaches, such as agent-based modeling, have shown that conditional cooperation can be explained for a wide spectrum of conditions  (Axelrod, 1984) . The project that we described is an illustration of the importance of using multiple methods that start to unravel the complexity of collective action. The alternative framework provided by  Poteete et al. (2010)  is not complete, but it provides a starting point to identify the important attributes of action situations that need to be measured in empirical studies. Instead of assuming selfish rational individuals maximizing a particular type of payoff function with complete information, we need to base analyses on assumptions about individuals who have imperfect knowledge, who learn and adopt norms, and who are influenced by microsituational and broader contextual variables.  Poteete et al. (2010)  believe that behavior is more directly influenced by microsituational variables, which in turn are influenced by the broader contextual variables  (Fig. 7) . Examples of microsituational variables include group size, heterogeneity among participants, reputation, and time horizons. Examples of broader context are policies at higher levels of organization, resource dynamics, history of social relationships, and geography. For a more in-depth discussion of this alternative framework, we refer to chapter 9 of  Poteete et al. (2010) . We will now emphasize the application of the framework to our case study. The microsituational variables in our experiments confirmed the high levels of cooperation we observed. The group size is relatively small -four or five people. The reputation of the other participants could be well estimated since the participants were fellow undergraduate students, or known community members. They had repeated interactions and could not change the group composition. When communication was possible, the level of cooperation often increased. In field experiments, communication was not possible, but was introduced during the role games in the return visits. In some situations, communication did not improve cooperation, as the level of trust between people was too low. Information about the actions of others is extensive and accurate but limited to the group level in the field experiments. During the role-playing games, the players often set the information system to be aware of others' actions or others' demands. Costly punishment was an option in lab experiments, while sanctions were executed by the experimenter in the field experiment. In the role-playing games, the villagers did not keep the punishment options. A microsituational variable that may limit the level of cooperation is when the time horizon is known to be limited. During the return visits, the broader context was more important. The lack of trust between the fishermen and the agencies in charge of resource management in the two fishery villages was very clear, explaining partly how reluctant the fishermen are to adopt rules. The other explanation lies in the lack of leadership or conflict among subgroups of fishermen. In the case of forestry villages, we have seen that both Thai and Colombian harvests are driven by the demand for forest products. For the irrigation village, the very conflictual situation between farmers and governmental bodies in Colombia is the key issue. In Thailand, the quality of the social relationships among farmers leads to a collective sharing of the water.  Ostrom (2007)  introduced a diagnostic approach to study social-ecological systems. She acknowledged the many variables that can influence the level of collective action. Instead of measuring all possible variables, we need to define a multilayered system of indicators that match the social-ecological system of interest. In any case, this means that we need to measure contextual variables more systematically than is often done. Especially with regard to experiments, we need to derive more relevant information to interpret the actions in the experiments  (Bouma et al., 2008; Anderies et al., to appear) . In this project, we introduced the role-playing games, which allow the introduction of more context in the experiments. As the role-playing games are crafted by the stakeholders, after being in the experiments, researchers obtained better information about the relevant variable in a situation from the stakeholders' perspective.

 Discussion This project combines different methods to test a framework for collective action applied to renewable resource management. Both methods are based on ""learning from action situations"". Experiments in the lab, experiments in the field, and role-playing games put people in action situations. These methods differ by the level of control on the actors and the level of context they embed. While some propose very simple settings allowing generic conclusions, others include more context, allowing a better understanding of the decision-making process of the players (individual and collective). We propose here an articulation of the methods. With lab experiments, we provided a renewable resource to the players, looked at the type of rules that players craft, and tested the role of sanctioning and communication. The field experiments were more contextualized. We measured the effect of rules in both settings. We associated the field experiments with self-constructed role-playing games to assess what type of context the players would add to make the experiments closer to reality. While doing so, we could assess how close to reality the earlier experiments were, and thus have a better understanding of the actions of the players during the experiments. For instance, during the field experiments, contrary to our hypothesis, we observed that the fishermen were worse than other types of stakeholders at playing the fishery experiments. We had thought that experienced people would be better at optimizing the results on a game similar to their reality. The role-playing game revealed that in the field, the fishermen are actually very individualistic, lacking trust in others' ability to respect any rule. Fishermen bring their experience to the experiments, but this does not mean that they will perform better. With the combination of methods, we find that microsituational variables and broader context are both important in explaining observed behavior in experiments. Given the importance of context, we need to perform experiments with communities in different contexts, including undergraduate students in Western societies and small-scale societies that have limited interaction with modern economies. This will require collective action among scholars who study collective action. We need to build up (cyber) infrastructure to collect and compare case studies and experiments to advance our understanding of governing the commons. Another conclusion from using these different methods is the fact that the quality of resource management lies more on the possibility of communication rather than on the types of rules crafted. Lab experiments have shown that the amount and distribution of communication are more important than the content of the interactions. The field experiments did not allow communication and crafting of rules. In general, we did not find an influence of the type of rule selected. In the role-playing games, we observed that in most cases stakeholders included negotiation arenas as part of the game environment, but did not specify the management rules. Again, like in the lab experiments, the organization of communication is more important than the content of communication. In closing, the various research activities stress the importance of social capital and trusting relationships in communities. Experience and knowledge of resource governance might be important, but not as important as the trust relationships in small communities. Whether this finding scales up to governance of socialecological systems are larger scales is an open question. Fig. 1 . 1 A screen shot of the experimental environment.

They are responsible for the attractive colour of many fruits and vegetables. Anthocyanins are glycosides of anthocyanidins and may have aliphatic or aromatic acids attached to the glycosidic residues  [1] . The aglycone fraction (anthocyanidin) differs according to the B cycle substituent (figure 1). Glycosylation most often appears in positions 3 and 5  [2]  and acylation with aromatic acids including cinnamic, p-coumaric, caffeic, ferulic or even malonic acids has a significant stabilising effect on anthocyanins  [3] [4] [5] . Anthocyanin colour is determined by the number of hydroxyl groups, their degree of methylation, the nature, number and position of the sugars bound to the anthocyanidin, and the nature and number of acids bound to the sugar, as well as the physico-chemical environment in which these anthocyanins are present. For example, the colour changes from pink to blue as the number of hydroxyls increases, and the other way round as the number of methyls increases  [6] . The same anthocyanin may have different colours according to the pH or concentration of the solution, but also according to the presence of co-pigments. A co-pigment is generally not coloured, but can increase the colour intensity of a solution of anthocyanins  [7] . Besides their antioxidant properties, anthocyanins have a high potential for use as natural colorants  [8] . Thermal degradation of anthocyanins has been covered by numerous studies, such as for red cabbage  [9] , black carrot, blood orange  [10] [11] [12] , strawberry  [13]  and blackberry  [14] . Indeed, knowing the degradation kinetic parameters is essential for predicting qualitative changes appearing during storage and during heat treatment processes such as pasteurisation. These studies have shown that anthocyanin degradation can be described using a first-order kinetic law. The stability of anthocyanins during heat treatments depends on the composition and characteristics of the medium: presence of other solutes such as sugars, salts, ascorbic acid or co-pigments, dissolved oxygen content and pH. The presence of sugars and salts increases the degradation rate of anthocyanins in red cabbage  [9] , açai and acerola  [15] . Nonetheless, not all sugars appear to be equivalent in this respect: fructose, arabinose, lactose and sorbose, for example, seem to accelerate anthocyanin degradation more than glucose, maltose and saccharose  [6] . The interaction mechanisms between sugar and anthocyanins have not been well explained. The reducing nature of sugar, for instance, is not critical. It is probable in this respect that certain products of hexose degradation in acid medium, such as furfural, are involved in anthocyanin degradation  [16] . Ascorbic acid is frequently added to fruitbased products to limit oxidation reactions such as enzymic browning, but also for nutrition purposes. This compound appears to promote anthocyanin degradation  [9, 17] . Nonetheless, the degradation constant k obtained in an acerola-based drink with 2.8 g·L -1 ascorbic acid is three times higher than that obtained in an açai-based drink to which ascorbic acid was added at the same concentration  [17] . This difference could be attributed to the fact that the flavonoid concentration in açai is 10 times higher than in acerola, and they may protect anthocyanins by intermolecular co-pigmentation  [8] . Other compounds may play a part in anthocyanin stability, such as dextrins, by preventing the transformation of the cationic form of anthocyanin into other less stable forms  [18, 19] . Similarly, anthocyanins with at least one glycosyl residue acylated by a phenolic acid residue (generally via the primary hydroxyl group) are protected by the phenomenon of intramolecular co-pigmentation  [1, 20, 21] . Acylated anthocyanins then adopt compact conformations, in which the flat aromatic part of the aromatic acyl residues stacks up (via hydrophobic interactions) on the positively charged pyrylium nucleus, thereby minimising its contact with water  [4] . A number of anthocyanin-rich sources have been investigated for their potential as commercial pigment extracts. Research led to the discovery of anthocyanin molecules with patterns that exhibit remarkable stability in a wider variety of food products. Thus, in order to complete these investigations, we performed this study. Therefore, our objective was to observe the effect of thermal storage on purified anthocyanins in a matrix representing a non-alcoholic drink at different temperatures. The results from this study will give information about the stability of purified mono-acylated triglycosylated anthocyanins from black carrot, and monoglycosylated anthocyanins from açai and Andean blackberry used as drink colorants. 
 Materials and methods 
 Plant material Fruits of Andean blackberries (Rubus glaucus Benth.) from Ecuador (Ambato), collected by a correspondent of the EPN (Escuela Politécnica National, Quito), were frozen whole upon harvesting, and kept at -18 °C. The açai (Euterpe oleracea Mart.) fruits were supplied to us by Bolthouse (Bélem, Brazil). Açai juice was extracted from fruits within 12 h of harvesting, and was then frozen and kept at -18 °C. For the black carrot (Daucus carota L.) studies, we used a purified anthocyanin powder extract (ColorFruit Carrot 12 WSP) supplied by Chr-Hansen (Prades-le-Lez, France). As a reference, a standard grape anthocyanin extract was selected (extract E163 supplied by Grap'Sud, Cruviers-Lascours, France). 
 Obtaining purified anthocyanin extracts In our study we chose to work with purified anthocyanin extracts equivalent to those offered by food additive suppliers. The protocol used for obtaining the extracts from the raw products (blackberry and açai) is described below. For blackberries, the juice was first extracted by pressing (Sakaya 12 hydraulic press, Bangkok). It was then stored for 12 h at 4 °C to precipitate some of the pectic compounds. After centrifuging at 8000 g for 15 min at 4 °C (Beckman Coulter, Ireland), the blackberry juice was enzyme-treated S. Zozio et al. (Pectinex Ultra SP-L, Novozymes, 1 mL·L -1 , 12 h, 20 °C) then vacuum-filtered on sintered glass (porosity no. 1). For açai, we received the juice directly from Brazil. Anthocyanins from blackberry juice were purified and concentrated on a laboratory scale by adsorption to a styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer with non-ionic and hydrophobic chemical properties, a specific surface of greater than 800 m 2 ·g -1 , and an average pore diameter of between  (20 and 25)  nm. This resin (XA 984) was supplied by Novacep (Epone, France). After optimisation, adsorption was performed at a flow rate of 8 BV·h -1 (BV = Bed Volume) and desorption with 65% ethanol (v/v) at 4 BV·h -1  [22] . Under these conditions, the overall anthocyanin recovery yield was 95.6% and the anthocyanin purification rate against the dry matter was 23. The purified anthocyanin extracts obtained were kept in pH 3-citrate buffer (46.5% 0.1 M citric acid, 3.5% 0.1 M dehydrated sodium citrate) at 4 °C. The same adsorption procedure was used to purify the anthocyanins in açai juice. The anthocyanin identification and concentration of these extracts were performed by HPLC by the method of Mertz et al.  [23] , as well as the total polyphenol content using the Folin Ciocalteu method  [24] . The main characteristics of the three anthocyanin extracts used were summarised (table I). 
 Measuring chromatic characteristics The colour unit equates to the colorant intensity of 1 g of colorant, which, when diluted in 100 mL of buffer solution at pH 3, gives an absorbance of 1  [1] . This quantity therefore equates to an extinction coefficient in which concentration is expressed in g·100 mL, and the optical thickness in cm (Equation 1). (1) where A λmax : absorbance at the maximum wavelength of diluted extract (0.5 < A λmax < 1); FD: dilution factor; m: mass (g) of extract introduced into a 100-mL vial of pH 3 buffer.  Table I .

The Brown Index [BI = (A 430 nm / A 520 nm )] and Violet Index [VI = (A 580 nm / A 520 nm )] are widely used for assessing colorant quality, but also for estimating the shade or hue  [1, 20] . Hence, they reflect the quantity of brown (A 430 nm ) or blue (A 580 nm ) in anthocyanin-based red colorants. 
 Monitoring of degradation during storage Anthocyanin degradation was monitored in a model solution simulating a non-alcoholic fruit-based drink. This aqueous solution comprised saccharose and citric acid. Potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate were used to prevent any microbe development  (table II) . Anthocyanin extracts from açai, blackberry and black carrot were added to the model solution until an absorbance of 2 was obtained (approximately 2 g·L -1 ). A quantity of 0.5 g·L -1 of ascorbic acid (Sigma, L'Isle d'Abeau, France) was added to part of the preparation in order to evaluate its effect on anthocyanins at 30 °C. The solution was then transferred to 60-mL sterile food-quality polyethylene bottles. Each bottle was nitrogen-inerted to eliminate oxygen, and then sealed with wax paper. The number of bottles prepared equated to the number of samples to be taken. The bottles were then placed in thermostatic chambers for 10 weeks. Three temperatures were chosen: 4 °C, representing the positive control; 20 °C, equating to an average temperate climate temperature; 30 °C, to simulate storage in a tropical environment; and 50 °C, to obtain accelerated ageing. The total anthocyanin content was assessed by the pH differential method  [25] . All absorbance readings were made against distilled water, which acted as the control. Spectrophotometric measurements were carried out using Shimadzu spectrophotometers (UV-1200 and UV-1605, Kyoto, Japan). Concentrations were expressed as cyanidin 3-glucoside (M = 449 g·mol -1 ) equivalents for açai and blackberry. Based on the initial absorption spectra of the anthocyanin solutions from blackberries, black carrots and açai, the maximum absorption wavelength was determined: 517 nm for açai anthocyanin, 514 nm for blackberry and 524 nm for carrot anthocyanin (figure 2). The molar extinction coefficient at pH 1 used for calculation was 26,900 L·mol -1 ·cm -1 for cyanidin 3-glucoside  [25] . Every week, three bottles were removed to measure the absorbance at λ max of the anthocyanin solutions and thrown out. To verify possible oxygen entry, the dissolved oxygen content was measured on specially obtained standard samples using a dissolved oxygen probe (CellOx 325) at the start of, during, and at the end of storage. The pH was measured at the start and end of storage on ten samples (Schott pH meter). S. Zozio et al. The soluble dry extract was measured at the start of and during storage to monitor changes (Atago refractometer). To detect any microbe developments, two indicators were used. For lactic bacteria, the titratable acidity of the solutions was measured by titrimetry (NaOH at 0.1 N to a pH of 8.2, Schott titrator). It was expressed as mass of lactic acid. For yeast, the ethanol content in the samples was analysed using an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph (GC) in automatic injection mode on a DB-Wax column  [26] . 
 Modelling of degradation kinetics According to previous studies on the black carrot  [12] , açai  [15]  and blackberry, Roselle and blood orange  [14, 27] , the thermal degradation of anthocyanins follows a firstorder kinetic. Therefore, two models were chosen. -The first is a conventional chemical kinetics model  (Equation 2 ). It defines the degradation rate constant k, which depends on the temperature and is represented by the Arrhenius equation  (Equation 3 ). (2) where : pre-exponential factor (s -1 ) ; E a : activation energy (J·mol -1 ); R: perfect gas constant (= 8.32 J·mol -1 ·k -1 ). -The second model (4), more often used in microbiology (Ball's model), defines a decimal reduction time which is related to temperature via a factor z (5). ... where D: decimal reduction time at temperature T (s); D 0 : value of D extrapolated at 0 °C; z is expressed in °C. The model's parameters were identified, using linear regression on the logarithmic curves of experimental data. Although the z value could be estimated from E a using the relationship z 10 ( ) ln RT 2 /E a = ( ) in a nar-row range of temperature, we chose to determine the z value graphically. The Arrhenius equation represents the effect of temperature on the anthocyanin degradation rate. Indeed, the plot of the Napierian logarithm of the k as a function of the inverse temperature determines the activation energy (E a ), and the representation of log 10 (D) as a function of temperature deduces the value of z. All the analyses were repeated three times. The values given in the tables correspond to the average ± standard deviation. 
 Results Regardless of the temperature, the pH of all the model solutions remained constant throughout the storage period (3.15 ± 0.007). The same applied to the soluble dry extract [(100 ± 1) g·kg -1 ]. The titratable acidity values measured at the end of storage revealed that there was no organic acid produced, and the production of ethanol measured by GC remained less than 3 mg·L -1 . These results confirmed that the drinks used were indeed microbiologically stable, and that the changes observed were only chemical or biochemical. Finally, the dissolved oxygen content did not vary during storage [(3.2 ± 0.06) mg O 2 ·L -1 ]. 
 Anthocyanin degradation Thermal degradation of the anthocyanins followed a first-order kinetic model: the logarithm of absorbance was inversely proportional to the treatment time (  figure 3) . The kinetic parameters k and D of the anthocyanin extracts from açai, blackberry and black carrot were determined graphically. The Arrhenius law and the z factor fit the temperature dependence of k and D well considering the R 2  (table III) . No anthocyanin degradation occurred in refrigerated storage (4 °C) during the 10 weeks of storage (  figure 3) . At all temperatures, the lowest degradation rate constants k were for the black carrot drink followed by açai and then blackberry. So the black carrot anthocyanins degraded A A 0 e -kt = k k ∞ e -E a /RT ( ) = k ∞ D 10 k ln = D D 0 10 -T/z ( ) = more slowly than açai and Andean blackberry anthocyanins during this thermal storage  (table III) . These results fall within the ranges usually reported in the literature for anthocyanin degradation  [12, 14, 15] . However, these values were greater than ours were. This observation is probably due to the matrices used: juice, concentrate, buffer solution, soft drink, or fermented juice and their composition  [9, 11, 13-15, 20, 28, 29] . In our study, we used anthocyanin extracts purified by resin adsorption, which was not the case with the previous work presented in the literature. In this respect, it is possible that purification of the anthocyanins improves their chemical stability by eliminating a lot of the non-phenolic solutes liable to promote degradation  [30, 31] . Açai and Andean blackberry have two main anthocyanins -cyanidin 3-glucoside and cyanidin 3-rutinoside  [22, 32] . Meanwhile, the black carrot has primarily a mono-acylated triglycosylated anthocyanin: cyanidin 3-galactoside-xyloside-glucosideferulic acid  [33] . This ferulic acid is fixed on the glycosyl residue and can approach the flavylium nucleus to protect it from nucleophilic attack by water on C 2 . This is the phenomenon of intramolecular co-pigmentation  [5] .   III) . Anthocyanins from blackberries and açai were therefore more sensitive to temperature increases than black carrot anthocyanins. Thus, purified acylated anthocyanins from black carrot are more stable in these conditions than blackberry and açai anthocyanins. These results agree with studies about the potential food applications of a number of acylated anthocyanin extracts  [4, 33] . Cevallos-Casals et al. showed that acylated anthocyanins were more stable to pH and temperature change than nonacylated ones  [34] . Such high stability may be attributed to the acylation on the anthocyanin structure  [35] [36] [37] . However, the E a of açai shows a good value compared with blackberry, although both have the same anthocyanin profile  (table III) : about 70% cyanidin 3-rutinoside and 30% cyanidin 3-glucoside. The polymeric resins used to purify the anthocyanins do not remove all other polyphenols. In fact, a purity index (anthocyanins / polyphenols) (% w/w) can be measured in order to evaluate the proportion of anthocyanins in contrast to the polyphenols. We found 60%. It means that there are 40% of polyphenol -non-anthocyanins in the extract. Thus, other flavonoids than anthocyanins are elute and can be found in the anthocyanin extract  [38, 39] . Some flavonoids also appear to play an important role in the anthocyanin protection mechanism  [8] . They appear to compete with water to interact with chromophore, which would displace the equilibrium between the coloured and colourless forms towards complexation of the coloured form. The literature highlights the effect of flavonoids and proanthocyanidin, contained in high level in açai  [15, 40, 41] . According to Pacheco-Palencia's study  [42] , flavone-Cglycosides (schaftoside, vicenin-2, isoorientin, orientin, isovitexin) found in açai enhance anthocyanin stability, while no significant effects were attributed to the presence of phenolic acids and procyanidins. However, no flavone-C-glycosides were detected in Andean blackberry  [22] . This result may suggest flavone-C-glycosides offer potential for their use as colour enhancers and stabilising agents in products rich in cyanidin glycosides. 
 Effect of ascorbic acid on anthocyanin stability Adding ascorbic acid caused a significant and rapid decrease in absorbance after one week of storage at 30 °C: 73% for acai, 89% for carrot and 93% for blackberry (  figure 4) . This negative effect of ascorbic acid on anthocyanins agreed with previous work  [8, 9, 13, 17, [43] [44] [45] . This decrease was immediate, since the absorbance of the açai, blackberry and carrot samples tended to stabilise after the first weeks of storage at 30 °C. Work on anthocyanins from strawberry  [13] , açai  [43]  and blackcurrant  [46]  has suggested a possible interaction between these two compounds. The mechanism suggested by Poei-Langston et al. consists of direct condensation of ascorbic acid on carbon 4 of the anthocyanin molecule, thereby causing the loss of both  [44] . Furthermore, according to Lacobucci and Sweeny (1983, quoted in  [17] ), anthocyanin colour loss caused by ascorbic acid could be due to oxidative cleavage of the pyrylium ring, with ascorbic acid acting as a molecular oxygen activator, producing free radicals  [45] . Moreover, the presence of flavonols exerts a protective effect on anthocyanins in the presence of ascorbic acid, probably through competition with water in condensation reactions  [47] . 
 Indices for polymeric colour and browning Anthocyanins are labile molecules that will undergo a number of degradative reactions. Enzymes such as polyphenoloxidase, peroxidase and glycosidase can have a devastating effect on anthocyanins  [48] . These enzymes may be native to the plant tissue, or their source may be from mould contamination and cause brown oxidation pigments  [1, 49] . An increase in the Brown Index (BI = A 430 /A 520 ) indicates a degradation of red pigments (A 520 ) or an increase in yellow pigments (A 430 ) due to oxidative polymerisation of tannins by oxygen. The stable BI values obtained at 4 °C indicate an absence of degradation at refrigerated temperatures, whereas, at higher temperatures, this index increased significantly (  figure 5) . Initially between 0.37 and 0.45, the BI was multiplied by a factor of 2.3 for açai and blackberry, and by 1.30 for black carrot at 50 °C. At 30 °C, the increase was smaller, with a multiplying factor of 1.37 for açai, 1.30 for blackberry and 1.08 for black carrot. At 20 °C, the increase ranged from 1.13 for açai, to 1.07 for blackberry and 1.04 for black carrot. These results confirmed that black carrot anthocyanins degraded much more slowly than blackberry or açai anthocyanins. The violet index (VI = A 580 /A 520 ) exhibited similar variation, with a smaller increase factor for the açai and black carrot at 50 °C, while the blackberry's index evolved more rapidly during storage (results not shown). In terms of colorant intensity, anthocyanin extract from açai is four times stronger than extract from black carrot and grape, in comparison with extract from blackberry, which is two times higher. This difference in colorant intensity can be explained among other things by their composition. Indeed, blackberry and açai extracts primarily contain anthocyanins and other flavonoids, unlike carrot and grape extracts which contain texturising agents such as maltodextrin or even glucose syrup. 
 Conclusion Our results clearly showed that anthocyanins from black carrot have a good stability during thermal storage (4 °C to 50 °C) with regard to blackberry and açai anthocyanins. Acylation of black carrot anthocyanins probably explains its greater stability. Acylated anthocyanins have shown to be promising alternatives to the use of synthetic dyes in drink systems. Under the tested conditions, no anthocyanin loss was revealed during storage of the model drinks in the refrigerated state (4 °C) for 10 weeks, and ascorbic acid at 0.5 g·L -1 considerably accelerated degradation of all anthocyanin studies. The better stability of açai anthocyanins compared with those of blackberry may be explained by the presence of flavonols in açai, which may also play an important role in the anthocyanin protection mechanism. Further studies are required to achieve better characterisation of anthocyanin behaviour in products such as drinks and to improve understanding of the phenomena involved. Indeed, it has been clearly demonstrated that the physico-chemical environment (pH, acidity, presence of enzymes, soluble dry extract, salts), nutritional environment (vitamins, sugars, proteins, phenolic acids, flavonoids) and external environment (light, temperature, ascorbic acid, maltodextrin) in which the anthocyanin is located affect its stability. It would first be necessary to define this environment precisely for each anthocyanin source. There should also be testing on a wider temperature range, in order to measure the kinetic parameters of degradation with greater precision. Similarly, a study of the various co-factors such as flavone-C-glycosides, which might improve and stabilise the colour of non-acylated anthocyanins, could expand the potential of anthocyanin-based colorants. Evaluación de la estabilidad de las antocianinas en el trascurso del almacenamiento de una bebida colorada por extractos de moras andinas (Rubus glaucus Benth.), de acaí (Euterpe oleracea Mart.) y de zanahorias negras (Daucus carota L.). Resumen -Introducción. Estudiamos el efecto de la temperatura en la estabilidad de tres fuentes de antocianinas purificadas, en una bebida gaseosa (pH 3, 10 °Brix) almacenadas a (4, 20, 30, 50) °C durante 60 días. Material y métodos. Se purificaron y se concentraron antocianinas de mora andina, de acaí y de zanahoria negra en laboratorio por absorción en un copolímero de estireno divinilbenceno. Para describir la cinética de degradación térmica de estas tres antocianinas, se emplearon dos acercamientos empíricos clásicos (modelos de Arrhenius y de Ball). Resultados. No se detectó ninguna degradación en el trascurso del almacenamiento refrigerado (4 °C). A todas las temperaturas, la constante de la velocidad de degradación (k) para las antocianinas de la zanahoria negra fue menor que la del acaí y la de la mora (0,42 × 10 -2 , 0,77 × 10 -2 et 1,08 × 10 -2 )·día -1 , respectivamente, a 30 °C. Las antocianinas de la zanahoria negra se degradaron menos rápidamente que las del acaí y las de la mora andina. A 20-50 °C, la energía de activación (E a ) fue (63,2 ± 4.3) kJ·mol -1 para la degradación de las antocianinas de la zanahoria negra, (66,3 ± 2.7) kJ·mol -1 para el acaí y (91,2 ± 0.4) kJ·mol -1 para la mora. Esta energía de activación E a de antocianinas de la mora, superior a la de la zanahoria negra y a la del acaí, implica que un ligero aumento de la temperatura basta para degradar estas antocianinas más rápidamente. Conclusión. Nuestros resultados mostraron claramente que las antocianinas de la zanahoria negra tienen una buena estabilidad durante el almacenamiento térmico (4 °C a 50 °C) en relación con las antocianinas de la mora y del acaí. La acilación de las antocianinas de la zanahoria negra podría explicar su mayor estabilidad. Las antocianinas aciladas han resultado ser prometedoras en sustitución del uso de los colorantes sintéticos, en los procesos de fabricación de bebidas.

During the 1990s, the combined effects of logging, clear-cutting, and forest regrowth on abandoned land are estimated to have released an amount equivalent to 10-25% of total annual anthropogenic emissions of 2 International Journal of Forestry Research CO 2  [1] [2] [3] [4] . Recent estimates are lower however; both as original methodologies have been revised and as the emissions from fossil fuel combustion have risen steeply, with the relative contribution of CO 2 emissions from deforestation and forest degradation estimated at 12% of total annual anthropogenic emissions of CO 2 for 2008  [5] . Nonetheless, deforestation is the second most important human induced source of CO 2 to the atmosphere after fossil fuel combustion  [5] . Under the Kyoto Protocol, reducing emissions from tropical deforestation and forest degradation (also known as REDD+) cannot be credited in the first commitment period (up to 2012). Significant moves forward were made in developing REDD+ at the 15th and 16th Conference of Parties (COP) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Copenhagen in December 2009 and Cancun in December 2010, respectively. At COP 15 a Decision was adopted regarding ""Methodological guidance for activities relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries"" or REDD+ (Decision 4/CP.15). In December 2010, the 16th meeting of the COP resulted in a Decision including ""Policy approaches and positive incentives on issues relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries; and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries"" (Decision 1/CP.  16 III C) . Countries willing to participate in this REDD+ mitigation mechanism under the UNFCCC will have to establish a national forest monitoring system (Decision 4/CP.15 Paragraph 1(d)) that should support a Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) requirement under the Convention and a phase 3 of REDD+ which should be fully measured, reported, and verified under Decision 1/CP.16 III C. Decision 4/CP.15 states that countries will have to use the most recent Guidance and Guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), as adopted or encouraged by the COP, as a basis for estimating anthropogenic forest-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by sources and removals by sinks, forest carbon stocks, and forest area changes (Decision 4/CP.15 Paragraph 1(c)). Estimating emissions and removals by sinks will have to be done in an adequate, consistent, complete, and transparent manner and be applied to the five carbon pools that will have to be measured and reported (these being aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, deadwood, litter, and soil organic matter)  [6] . It is expected that REDD+ countries will have to provide estimates on forest carbon and forest carbon stock changes by 2012, when the Kyoto Protocol is expected to be replaced by the new agreement encompassing REDD+. 2012 is very close, and countries will be under pressure to provide the appropriate data in time if they wish to participate in the REDD+ mechanism. A key task is the analysis of spatiotemporal variation of forest carbon stocks stored as vegetation biomass in tropical forests in line with the IPCC Guidance and Guidelines and the relevant COP Decisions on REDD+. Obtaining sufficient ground data to do so can be an expensive and timeconsuming undertaking. One of the recurring debates in measuring forest carbon stocks and forest carbon stock changes for REDD+ is the use of existing field measurement data. These mainly consist of data collected for scientific research purposes (ecological data), detailed but sparse in a given country, and commercial forest inventory data for logging purposes (inventory data) that cover large areas but are often less detailed for carbon studies. However, the latter might provide a basis for data acquisition and analysis on forest carbon stocks in REDD+ countries. Commercial forest inventory data have been used in several studies to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) in tropical forests (e.g.,  [7] [8] [9] ), yet to date they have not been evaluated in the context of REDD+ and reporting requirements under the UNFCCC. In addition to the data that REDD+ participating countries need to produce or obtain to report for REDD+, there is a need for improved and more accurate methods of determining tropical forest biomass and understanding its spatial distribution. Most studies on AGB and carbon content have been conducted in the Brazilian Amazon and in South-East Asia, resulting in a considerable gap in knowledge and understanding of AGB patterns for sub-Saharan Africa. This is particularly the case for the Congo Basin Forest, the second largest tropical forest block in the world after the Amazon forest. At the time of writing, the REDD+ context and methodological implications are still very new and in development. In this context, and following the IPCC Guidelines, the REDD+ COP Decisions and considering the gaps in AGB estimates for the Congo Basin Forest, the overarching goal of this paper is to identify the challenges in using commercial forest inventory data to report on forest carbon stock and forest carbon stock changes for REDD+. Our specific objectives are (i) to estimate one of the five carbon pools identified by the IPCC (AGB, frequently the largest pool) using existing commercial forest inventory data, (ii) to evaluate the estimated AGB in terms of precision, accuracy, and uncertainty, and (iii) to assess if this type of data could be used by countries to produce a conservative Emission Factor in phase 2 of a phased REDD+ and/or to report on Emission Factors following at least tier 2 requirements (see next) for a third REDD+ phase. The analysis will focus on data from Gabon as a case study in the Congo Basin Forest region. 
 Study Framework 2.1. Some Key Concepts regarding REDD+, MRV, and the IPCC. With regards to land use, and land use change and forestry (LULUCF), five forest-related activities have been identified in the REDD+ context (Decision 1/CP.16 III C): (i) deforestation, (ii) forest degradation, (iii) conservation, (iv) sustainable management of forests, and (v) enhancement of forest carbon stocks. The simplest and most commonly used methodological approach to quantify emissions and removals for a national GHG inventory presented in the IPCC Good Practice Guidance  [10]  is the combination of (i) the extent to which human ?  Figure 1 : Diagrammatic representation of the existing data and its potential input in the REDD+ implementation process. The central question is if commercial forest inventory data could be used to provide the necessary information (i) to establish a conservative estimate on Emission Factor (EF) and (ii) to report on EF at a tier 2 level. activities take place, which for REDD+ applies principally to forest area and forest area change (called activity data or AD) with (ii) coefficients that quantify the emissions or removals per unit activity, which for REDD+ applies principally to forest carbon stocks and forest carbon stock changes (called emission factors or EF). The basic equation is therefore Emissions = AD × EF. (1) A country will have to report on carbon stock changes (emissions and/or removals by sinks) only if these are human induced. In that respect the IPCC advises the use of the ""managed land"" concept as a proxy to discriminate human induced emissions. Only changes in managed land will have to be estimated and reported. The commercial forest inventory data are ideal in this sense, as they would be considered as ""managed"" land and cover important forest surfaces of many tropical forest countries. Producing the national GHG inventory can be done at three different levels of accuracy and methodological complexity which are called ""tiers."" Tier 1 is the basic method and uses default values obtained from the IPCC Emission Factor Database; tier 2 is the intermediate and improves on tier 1 by using country-specific data; finally tier 3 is the most demanding in terms of complexity and data requirements. Tiers 2 and 3 are generally referred to as the ""higher-tier"" methods and are generally considered to be more accurate. It is considered good practice to apply the higher-tier methods to key categories, unless the resource requirements to do so are considered prohibitive  [6] . Following the most recent IPCC guidelines  [6, 10]  and the REDD+ COP Decisions, the minimum objective of countries that wish to participate in a mitigation mechanism (such as REDD+) under the UNFCCC should be to compile a national GHG inventory with estimates of carbon stock changes with a known certainty and accuracy (tier 2 or tier 3 level). In order to meet these criteria, a country will need to have (i) country-specific estimates of EF, including the five IPCC carbon pools, (ii) multitemporal inventory data, and (iii) uncertainty estimates with any data reported. The IPCC indicates that a quantitative uncertainty analysis should be performed by estimating the 95% Confidence Interval (CI) of the emissions and removals estimates for individual categories and for the total data collection method. Furthermore, it is good practice that estimates respect the ""conservativeness principle,"" that is, when completeness or accuracy of estimates cannot be achieved, the reduction of emissions (for REDD+ based on forest carbon stock and forest carbon stock change estimates) should not be overestimated, or at least the risk of overestimation should be minimized  [11] . For a brief overview of the IPCC's methodological approach in relation to REDD+ and forest inventories specifically, we refer to  [12] . As indicated in the COP16 Decision (Decision 1/CP.16 III C Paragraph 73), REDD+ will be implemented in phases to allow countries to participate in the mechanism while taking account of their national circumstances. Most countries interested in REDD+ are currently in the first phase: the development of national strategies or action plans, policies and measures, and capacity building. Following this, two more phases will take place: (i) the implementation of national policies and measures and national strategies or action plans that could further involve capacity building, technology development and transfer and results-based demonstration activities and (ii) evolving into results-based actions that should be fully measured, reported, and verified (  Figure 1 ). As stated previously, the third aim of this paper is to evaluate if and how commercial forest inventory data can be used to support any of these phases, especially the last two. 
 Logging Context in Central Africa and Gabon. The key factor driving forest fragmentation and degradation, and thus the key to near-term management of forests in Central Africa and in particular Gabon, is now commercial logging. With a land area of approximately 26.8 million ha, Gabon is the least densely populated country in Central Africa with approximately 1.5 million inhabitants and an average of 5 persons per square kilometre  [13] . Gabon's forests, which cover an estimated 77% of its land surface, contain over 400 species of tree, with approximately 100 species suitable for commercial purposes. Commercial exploitation began around 1882, and in 1913 Okoumé (Aucoumea klaineana Pierre), Gabon's most valuable wood, was introduced to the international market. Forestry was the primary source of economic income until about 1968 when the industry was supplanted by crude oil as a source of foreign exchange. Gabon's small population, combined with high revenues from oil production and high operating costs, has sheltered its forest resources from demographic, agricultural, and industrial pressures  [14] . Gabon's tropical timber exports reached a peak of 1.9 million m 3 in 2007, declined to 1.8 million m 3 in 2008 and increased slightly in 2009. It is now the largest exporter of tropical hardwood of the region, and it is the International Tropical Timber Organization's (ITTO) third largest exporter of tropical logs (unprocessed/raw logs). However, Gabon's log exports are expected to plummet in 2010 following the implementation of the log export ban  [15] . 
 Methods 
 Study Sites. The field measurement data presented here originates from five different logging companies operating in the central area of Gabon (  Figure 2 ), totalling ten logging concessions. Each of the management inventories was undertaken by the same study bureau (Sylvafrica, Gabonhttp://www.onfinternational.org/en/onfi-abroad/sylvafric. .html). Hence the methodologies used across the concessions are as consistent as possible. 
 Two Different Data Sets Dataset 1: Commercial Forest Inventory Data. The Gabonese Forestry Code (art. 56) requires commercial logging companies to undertake an ""inventaire d'aménagement"" or ""management inventory."" As part of this Management Inventory (MI), companies are required to assess the floristic composition and structure of the forest in their concessions, for all species. Article 58 of the Gabonese Forestry Law 16/01 stipulates that the minimal level of accuracy required for a Forest Management Unit (FMU-Unité Forestière d'Aménagement (UFA)) equals 10% of the global number and volume of stems of the most important exploitable species at the time of the first rotation. The inventory method used by Sylvafrica is based on a systematic inventory of 0.3 ha plots (100 m × 30 m). Tree diameters are measured in the plots but not specifically noted. Rather, trees are placed in diameter windows of 5 cm, where the middle diameter of the diameter class is assigned to the tree, for example, 20 cm for the window 17.5 to 22.5 cm. Within the plots, three subdivisions are made. The first is a subplot of 0.075 ha (25 m × 30 m; Sp 1) where all trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) above 17.5 cm are, in principle, measured. In the second subplot of 0.105 ha (35 m × 30 m; Sp 2), all trees with a DBH above 37.5 cm are included and finally, in the third subplot of 0.12 ha (40 m × 30 m; Sp 3) all trees with a diameter above 57.5 cm are included (  Figure 3 ). An example of such a layout is presented for concession 1  (Figure 4 ). Only commercial tree species are measured in the 5 ha transect, hence this data is not used in our analysis.  Species were determined in the field using pilot names that were related to their scientific names using a database developed by Sylvafrica. Dataset 2: Ecological Data. In order to evaluate the accuracy of AGB estimates and account for smaller diameter classes (10-17.5 cm) in the commercial inventory plots, we used and analysed 25 permanent ""ecological plots"". These are located in concession 9, have an area of 0.25 ha (50 m × 50 m) and were measured in 2002. In contrast with the commercial forest inventory plots, no subplots were used in the permanent ecological plots. All trees above 10 cm were measured and species were identified carefully. 
 Classification of Forest Types. The data set extends over the dense forests of Gabon. The concession boundaries have been drawn based on administrative regulations and as such do not represent ecological zones and/or regions. Therefore, analysing the AGB of the forests by concession has little ecological relevance. In scaling up AGB estimates, it would be more useful to stratify the forests based on their floristic composition to provide more detailed information on the variability of its forest carbon stocks. Here we explore and demonstrate how such a stratification can be undertaken with commercial inventory data. To classify these forests into distinct forest types (FTs) using the percentage frequency/abundance for all families present in each plot, we applied agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) using XLSTAT. The clustering analysis was done at the family level rather than at the species level to avoid uncertainties of species identification during the inventory. Depending on the objectives, using a clustering analysis based on extensive field data can provide a better representation of the forests than existing general stratifications or phytogeographical classifications. An AHC analysis queries clusters without any previous understanding of the number of groups or their structure. For every iteration of the algorithm, the two nearest clusters are merged. AHC requires the definition of two elements which are (i) a measure to compute the distance between each pair of individuals and (ii) an agglomerative criterion that can be seen as a distance between two clusters. For the former we used Euclidean distance as a dissimilarity measure. For the latter we used Ward's method for agglomeration (which consists of fusing the two clusters that minimise the increase in the total within-clusters sum of squares). Different truncation levels were used, and finally three FTs were retained as lower truncation levels (using more FTs did not provide more ecological insight). 
 Estimating Aboveground Biomass Step 1: Allometric Equation and Input Variables. To calculate the AGB of the plots, we used the allometric equation for ""moist forest"" stands provided by Chave et al.  [16]  including the Correction Factor for the back transformation from the log-log to the exponential form (see  (7)  and  Table 4  in  [16] ): AGB est = ρ exp −1.562 + 2.148 ln DBH + 0.207(ln DBH) 2 −0.0281(ln DBH) 3 × exp σ 2 2 , (2) where σ is 0.356, ρ is wood density in g m −3 , and DBH in centimetres. The AGB estimate is then in kg, which is converted into Mg ha −1 . Average wood density of the species present in the field inventories was found at species level or genus level, as genus level has been found to be representative of species-level wood density  [17, 18]  using the wood densities in the Global Wood Density Database  [19]  and wood densities derived by Maniatis et al.  [18]  for 248 species. For the other 83 species where no representative information could be found, the average value of the 248 species was used (in this case 0.624 with a standard deviation of 0.153 g cm −3 ). with different area sizes and measuring DBH from different size classes, we applied a ratio-based correction, using Matlab to automate the process:  AGB Sp1 = dclass1Sp1+dclass2Sp1+dclass3Sp1, AGB Sp2 = dclass1Sp1 a 1 × a 2 + dclass2Sp2 + dclass3Sp2, AGB Sp3 = dclass1Sp1 where Sp is the subplot, a, a 1 , a 2 , and a 3 are the areas for the plot, subplot 1, 2, and 3, respectively. dclass1Sp1 is the biomass of all the trees that fall into diameter class 1 for subplot 1, dclass2Sp2 for the trees that fall into diameter class 2 for subplot 2, and so forth. The diameter classes are as follows: dclass1 = 17.5 − <37.5 cm (assigned tree DBH ranges: 20-25-30-35 cm); dclass2 = 37.5 − <57.5 cm (assigned tree DBH ranges: 40-45-50-55 cm); dclass3 ≥ 57.5 cm (assigned tree DBH 60 cm and above). Note our distinction between three broad diameter classes (defined in the previous sentence) and the diameter windows of 20.0 ± 2.5 cm, 25.0 ± 2.5 cm, and so forth. Step 3: AGB Calculations for the Ecological Plots. The AGB for the ecological plots is calculated as described in Step 1. Step 4: Evaluating Uncertainty on Tree-Level AGB Estimate. There are two main sources of error and uncertainty for the tree-level AGB estimate: (i) the measurement error (σ M ) and (ii) the uncertainty surrounding the choice of allometric equation (σ A )  [20] . When scaling from a tree AGB estimate to a plot AGB estimate, the measurement error declines with increasing number of trees sampled. The allometric equation uncertainty, however, can either be a precision error (individual trees have a form differing from the mean tree form) that declines with increased tree sample size or a systematic (accuracy) error that persists independent of sampling size (the mean tree form in the study area is different from that assumed in the allometric equation). We assume that the measurement and the allometric uncertainties are independent sources of variability. Monte Carlo simulations were used to simulate the parameters to calculate σ M and σ A  [21] . The errors in trunk diameter and density measurement all result in an error in estimating the AGB taken from an allometric model. We denote the standard error associated with the diameter measurement as σ D . We assume that the largest source of error here arises from the assignment of diameters into 5 cm windows, rather than any direct measurement error. As it was not possible to remeasure a subset of the trees, we took the ""noted"" diameter and assumed that the errors in diameter followed a centred normal distribution with a standard deviation of 2.5 cm (the error is assumed to be equal to the diameter windows). Errors for wood density mainly arise from misidentification of the tree or a variation of wood density within or among conspecific trees  [22] . In commercial forest inventories species are often determined approximately, and the use of pilot names may include several species. We used the individual tree wood densities and assumed that the errors in International Journal of Forestry Research 7 wood density followed a centred normal distribution with a standard deviation of 0.1 g cm −3 . 5,000 trees randomly selected from three concessions from the original dataset were used for the simulation for σ M using  (2) . For each tree, the error in diameter and wood density was simulated 1,000 times (assuming independent normal distribution of errors). In other words, we varied ρ and DBH at random for each tree 1,000 times. Tree AGB was calculated with the simulated diameters and wood densities (1,000 values). We also calculated the ""original"" AGB for each tree, in other words, the AGB of the tree using the original diameter and wood density value. To evaluate the error in tree AGB resulting from the allometric equation, we varied only ε (in (4)) assuming a centred normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 0.356 (residual standard error of the equation, see Chave et al.  [16] ). The same trees and number of simulations (1,000) were used as described above: (4) Step 5: Estimating AGB between 10-17.5 cm. Not accounting for smaller diameters can considerably underestimate plot level AGB. To correct for this, we used the data of the 25 permanent plots in concession 9. Equation (2) was used to calculate AGB. Wood density was treated as explained above. We estimated the percentage of AGB in trees from 10 cm to 17.5 cm to total plot AGB in order to be able to correct for the missing diameters between 10 cm to 17.5 cm in the inventory data. We did not estimate AGB for trees smaller than 10 cm. However, this could be done down to 2 cm DBH using biomass expansion factors such as the ones developed, for example, by Henry et al.  [23] . Step 6: Estimate of Plot Level AGB. To calculate the plot level AGB we applied (i)  (3)  and  (4) , (ii) the simulations described in step 4 on all trees for all plots, and (iii) the correction factor for the missing diameter classes resulting from step 5 in all plots. Hence, plot level AGB was simulated 1,000 times for all 2,240 plots using (4) through a Monte Carlo approach in Matlab (by varying epsilon, ρ, and DBH simultaneously). We regard these values as the most representative of their ""true"" precision and accuracy and therefore report these values. We also compare these values with the original AGB plot calculation by applying (i) (2) and (3) without random errors and (ii) the correction factor resulting from step 5 on all plots. 
 Statistical Analyses. Even though one could expect a normal distribution of AGB given that the overall plot size is greater than 0.25 ha  [20, 24]    were used with a pairwise comparison to test relationships. Uncertainties are reported at 95% Confidence Intervals. The minimum number of sampling plots (n) required to estimate AGB at a certain accuracy level for each of the concessions was calculated as follows  [25] : n = C × t e 2 , ( 5 ) where C is the coefficient of variation, e is the required accuracy, and t is the Student's t at the nominated probability level and the appropriate number of degrees of freedom (in this case 95%; two-tailed t = 1.960). 
 Results 
 Forest Types. Three FTs resulted from the agglomerative clustering analysis based on family abundance (  Figure 5 ).  Figure 6  shows how these are distributed over the concessions. The FTs can be described as follows using the In the dominant families in FT 1, the main species with relative proportions over 6% in the three dominant families are Santiria trimera (13%), Coula edulis (11%), Aucoumea klaineana (9%), and Diogoa zenkeri (7%)-together comprising 40% of the species in the three families. FT 2 is largely dominated by Okoumé (Burseraceae) (24% in itself of all species of the three dominant families) which is a pioneer species. The species with a relative abundance over 6% in the three dominant families of FT 3 are Santiria trimera (8%), Scorodoploeus zenkeri (7%), Julbernadia pellegriniana (7%), and Dialium angolense (6%)-together making up 29% of the species in the three families. Based on the species that compose the dominant families, FT 3 is probably the least disturbed forest. 
 AGB Calculations. For the 25 permanent plots of 0.25 ha 2,836 trees were measured. These plots had an average AGB of 485 ± 27 Mg ha −1 (note that, unless otherwise specified, with ± in the text we denote the standard error). The average percentage of plot AGB in trees between 10 cm-17.5 cm to total plot AGB is 16 ± 1 Mg ha −1 (4%). A correction of 4% of total plot AGB was applied to total plot AGB of the inventory plots to correct for these initially unaccounted small diameter classes. For the commercial inventory plots, 2,240 plots of 0.3 ha were measured, totalling 675 ha and 48,310 trees (value not adjusted for missing diameter classes). These plots are distributed over a total area of 1,374,414 ha spread across the country  (Figure 1 ). We find that σ M = 0.68 AGB and that σ A = 0.42 AGB . Therefore, the uncertainty of AGB estimation of a single tree is 110% of the estimated AGB, partitioned into 68% due to the measurement uncertainty and 42% due to the allometric model. At the stand level, the random aspect of measurement errors tends to cancel out, however. The precision of the allometry at the stand level is high; however the accuracy is lower. Furthermore, we observe that the simulated plot AGB is on average 3 Mg ha −1 (1%) lower than the ""original"" plot AGB (i.e., the simulations are slightly biased by 1%). We report the simulated AGB as they correct for the 5 cm diameter windows, uncertainties in wood density and the allometry and allow us to take the AGB variability better into account. The mean AGB for FTs 1, 2, and 3 are 333 ± 7 Mg ha −1 , 312 ± 7 Mg ha −1 and 324 ± 5 Mg ha −1 , respectively. The mean ""original"" and ""simulated"" AGB per concession and FT, together with the mean of all plot AGB, are presented in  Table 1 . No relationship was found between small tree AGB, medium tree AGB, and large tree AGB (AGB in diameter classes 1, 2, and 3, resp.) in the commercial inventory plots. There is a significant difference in AGB between FTs 1 and 2 and FTs 2 and 3 (P < .05), reflecting the floristic composition of the FTs as described above. In terms of average wood density there is a difference between all the FTs (P < .05). However, wood density is higher in FTs 1 and 3 than in FT 2  (Table 1) , again reflecting the floristic composition of the forest. This difference is not observed for DBH (  Table 1 ). The lower wood density could explain the lower AGB in FT 2. Taking the diameters above 17.5 cm for both the permanent and commercial forest inventory plots in concession 9, on average, the total number of trees measured is slightly lower (23%) in the inventory plots (187 ± 3 trees ha −1adjusted per plot by adapting equation  (3)  to diameter instead of AGB) than in the permanent plots (243 ± 2 trees ha −1 ). However, it appears that the range of the number of trees measured in the commercial forest inventories is much larger (9-443 trees ha −1 ) than in the ecological plots (164-328 trees ha −1 ).

Accuracy and Uncertainty. The number of plots that have been put in place for each concession is systematically higher than that requested to attain a 10% accuracy level, and in some cases even a 5% level (  Table 2 ). The numbers of plots put in place for the FTs are all higher than requested to attain than the 5% accuracy level. The uncertainty of the AGB in total and per FT is low  (Table 3 ).

 Discussion 
 Data Challenges for Emission Factors for REDD+. Our analyses show that commercial forest inventories are potentially useful for the estimation of the AGB forest carbon stock pool. However, we have shown that a number of factors limit their utility. The main practical challenges for a country to use these data to (i) produce conservative EF estimates for a phase 2 implementation of REDD+ and (ii) to report at a tier 2 on EF for phase 3 are the following. (1) A ""formal"" agreement between a government and the logging companies/study bureaus will have to be established for handover of the data. (2) The data will need to be in their ""raw format"" so they can be adequately analysed. (3) If different field methodologies have been used these will have to be harmonized and standardised. (4) Smaller trees (e.g., at least up to a lower limit of 10 cm DBH) need to be measured. If not, a suitable correction will need to be applied. (5) In many commercial forest inventories, the diameter is measured but not noted, and instead trees are placed in diameter classes (e.g., of 5 cm). (6) The data provide information on one carbon pool only (AGB). International Journal of Forestry Research (7) Information on forest carbon stock changes over time is lacking. (8) Plots are usually not permanent and not tagged making it difficult to revisit plots for additional measurements either to improve the estimates or to measure a carbon stock change after logging activities. (9) A country will have to report on its entire managed forest land, meaning on its different forest types. Commercial forest inventory data often only cover dense forests. Countries will still have to report other forest types and hence find or produce data on such other forests. 
 Forests and AGB. Forest stratification affects the values a country could report on of forest carbon stock and forest carbon stock changes. Many forest stratifications are coarse and often largely based on remote sensing data and analysis. We have shown that, with this dataset, it is possible to propose a forest stratification that reflects the floristic composition of the forest and can reflect forest ecology (e.g., FT 2 is indicative of a disturbed forest and is dominated by the pioneer species Okoumé). As they cover vast percentages of many countries' forest land, commercial forest inventory field data can be used to improve existing forest stratification maps  [28] [29] [30]  so that in the future they may be used as the basis for a more robust forest stratification to estimate forest carbon stock and carbon stock changes. In our case study of Gabon, we estimated uncertainties introduced by omitting small trees, by using 5 cm diameter window, by misidentification and through its effects on wood density and by variations in the allometry. We find that the inventory AGB estimates presented (324 Mg ha −1 ) fall within the upper range of studies that have been previously conducted for sub-Saharan tropical African forests (  [8]  Regarding the accuracy of the AGB estimates between the inventory plots and the ecological plots, we note that AGB in the ecological plots is higher (485 Mg ha −1 ) than in the inventory plots (324 Mg ha −1 ). This could be a result of two factors: (i) the implementation of the measurement method used by Sylvafrica (set up in this manner for very different purposes indeed) and (ii) the fact that the ""ecological"" plots we used for the analysis were consciously placed in ""undisturbed primary"" forest (with a distance rule of being at least 100 m to 150 m from roads) and may have a ""majestic forest bias"" in plot location. The former are assigned GPS coordinates in the office which the field teams are guided by for the actual field measurements. Measuring plots which are on steep slopes, rocky surfaces, near rivers, and so forth can result in a lower plot biomass and fewer trees measured. In order to really evaluate the accuracy of the differences in AGB values, the number of trees measured in different diameter ranges, and their effect on AGB, some ""pseudo-"" ecological plots would need to be randomly distributed over a large area, without targeting a specific forest type. Comparing the number of trees measured in the permanent plots to the inventory plots for the same concession (concession 9), the number of trees recorded in the inventory plots appears to be 23% less than the number recorded in the ecological plots on a per-hectare basis. These are mainly in the smaller diameter classes, although a few big trees could also make the difference. This could be due to two factors. First, during the measurements in the inventory plots, some trees may have been missed during the measurements (in addition to those not measured in the last two diameter windows). Second, the difference could simply be due to landscape/vegetation differences as is the case for biomass. As with many forest inventories, the diameter of the trees is not explicitly measured and noted, rather, only the diameter window is noted. If one assumes that the diameter distribution is exponential, taking the centre of the diameter window instead of the mean diameter in the window could result in a systematic overestimation of AGB  [33, 34] , the latter reporting a 3% overestimation. Due to the large number of plots that are put in place for commercial field inventory data, the accuracy of the AGB estimates appears to be better than 5% for all FTs. Similarly, the sampling uncertainty associated with the data is low. We observed that average wood density was significantly different for each of the FTs, with a higher wood density for FTs 1 and 3 (which are more indicative of a primary forest) than FT 2 (which is indicative of a more open and/or degraded forest), also resulting in a lower AGB in FT 2. Although a full ecological analysis is beyond the scope and purpose of this paper, this result merits some attention as it could suggest that wood density of the FTs is influenced by environmental variables and/or could reflect historic land use activities and changes. A more detailed ecological study is underway to test for relationships between wood density and variables such as soil type and historic land use in the Congo Basin Forest  [34] . 
 What Is Possible or Necessary to Use Inventory Data for REDD+? The main limitation to respond to tier 2 requirements for a third phase of REDD+ using commercial forest inventory data does not seem to be country-specific data or accuracy (remember the three requirements listed in Section 2.1)-rather, it is the lack of multitemporal inventory data and data on forest carbon stock changes that present the biggest challenge. Multi-temporal data has two main purposes: first to provide information on forest carbon stock changes due to anthropogenic activities and second to study forest dynamics. Quantifying forest carbon stock changes due to logging activities is important information for an REDD+ country to report on EF. In this respect, a formal collaboration with logging companies to measure forest carbon stock changes (for all relevant carbon pools) in the field would provide valuable data for carbon stock and carbon stock change estimates due to logging and different logging practices. In theory, one option would be that if a same concession has previously been logged and the previous field inventory can be found, a comparison of the two forest carbon stocks in the same concession could provide a forest carbon stock change estimate or at least a preliminary assessment. In practice, unfortunately, the obligations for management inventories in Central Africa are recent, and it is questionable if this could be done. Another challenge to respond to tier 2 requirements for a phase 3 is to obtain estimates for EF for the five carbon pools, of which AGB only represents one. To be able to provide conservative EF estimates for the second REDD+ phase, a country could use already established equations to estimate the carbon in the other four pools based on AGB. For example, allometric equations are often used to calculate the belowground biomass as a proportion of the aboveground biomass  [35] . However, in order to respond to tier 2 requirements and/or a phase 3, countries would have to produce data to calculate a dynamic EF for AGB and the other four carbon pools with associated known uncertainties and accuracies. The essence of the above is that, by knowing the error, accuracy, and uncertainty related to the AGB estimates, a country can make an informed decision on how conservative the values for forest carbon stocks will be that they report to the UNFCCC Secretariat for REDD+. Based on this data only, Gabon could, for phase 3, put forward a value of 324 Mg ha −1 for the forest carbon stock in the AGB carbon pool in its dense forests with a 5% accuracy. For a second REDD+ phase, Gabon could use a general value of 324 Mg ha −1 for its forests. In this phase, it is optional for the country to include accuracy and uncertainty estimates for EF. However, we suggest that it is good practice to do so when and where possible. This would allow the country to be conservative and accurate in this second phase using existing and readily available data, whilst giving itself the opportunity to improve these data, collect additional data to fill the gaps, and fully prepare the country for the third phase which will be reported and verified. 
 Conclusion Reliable AGB estimates for Central African and Gabonese forests that reflect the heterogeneity of the landscape are generally scarce. Tropical forest countries that wish to participate in a mitigation mechanism such as REDD+ will have to provide data in the near future (∼2012) on forest carbon stocks and forest carbon stock changes while following IPCC Guidelines and the relevant REDD+ COP Decisions. In this context, we set out three specific objectives in the introduction of this paper. The first one was to estimate AGB using existing commercial forest inventory data. We found that the fully corrected mean AGB in the FTs ranges from 312 Mg ha −1 to 333 Mg ha −1 in Gabon. Secondly, we evaluated the estimated corrected AGB in terms of accuracy and uncertainty. We demonstrate that although the variability in AGB estimates is high, due to the large number of plots in each FT, the estimates for the FTs and almost all concessions have 10% accuracy and a low uncertainty (± 10 to 13 Mg ha −1 ). Finally, we questioned whether the data could be used to report on EF at a tier 2 level (phase 3) and/or to estimate a conservative emission factor in phase 2 of a phased REDD+ implementation. We find that the data could be used to produce a very conservative EF estimate for a second REDD+ phase. If one was more confident about the accuracy of the AGB values and forest carbon stocks, this data could partially respond to tier 2 requirements for a phase 3. It is evident from our analysis that several potential REDD+ countries will face data quality and quantity challenges to report on EF for the MRV-able phase 3. On one hand, available ""ecological data"" might be both precise and accurate but can often not be regarded as representative of the forest types. On the other hand, inventory data may be less precise and less accurate, but can be considered as representative of the forest types. Either way, our analysis has shown some of the major caveats of using commercial forest inventory data and/or ecological data to estimate AGB to report on EF following tier 2 requirements for phase 3 of REDD+. Subsequently, it may be desirable and in the medium term more cost-effective for certain REDD+ countries to undertake targeted fieldwork to produce specific data on EF to report to the UNFCCC Secretariat (cf.  [12] ). With less than one year to go before 2012, REDD+ countries will have to evaluate and decide soon what the best approach is for them to be able to report on EF following tier 2 requirements. If they decide to collect additional data and/or implement national forestry inventories specifically for this aim, the key questions will be as follows: (i) what resources are available; (ii) what in-country capacity is available to do so; (iii) how much time will be needed; (iv) as a result of that, what data compromises will have to be made for what phases. The issues addressed in this paper also require some thought on how the scientific community could contribute towards optimizing existing data for REDD+ and how to help produce data in the appropriate format. In a first instance, there is a need for capacity building within this community to understand IPCC reporting requirements for REDD+ and how it may contribute to help REDD+ countries overcome these challenges. The scientific community could also provide tools to, for example, create a system to homogenise estimates between different commercial forest inventories, create decision tree rules to choose the most appropriate allometric equations and understand gaps and target methodological development to help REDD+ countries reach tier 2 reporting requirements for the MRV-able third phase of REDD+. In conclusion, we believe that our analysis has illustrated the opportunities and challenges to use commercial forest inventory data to report on EF in an REDD+ context under the UNFCCC and the urgency of acquiring suitable data in a suitable format.

We argue that social simulation of this practice of cooperation can help in understanding further this new way of doing science, building on existing experience in simulation of knowledge flows as well as pragmatic approaches in social sciences.

http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/14/4/12.html",22,20111104,Using Social Simulation to Explore the Dynamics at Stake in Participatory Research,,"1.1 Participatory research is increasingly popular at the interface between science and policy. Scholars consider that it might resolve concerns about the use and the relevance of research outcomes by policy makers, the access to relevant information, or the legitimacy of research outcomes and their transfer towards stakeholders  (Barreteau et al. 2012) . Participatory research has the same objectives of knowledge production as conventional research. "" The key difference between participatory and other research methodologies lies in the location of power in the various stages of the research process""  (Cornwall and Jewkes 1995) . In a participatory research, scientists share power on controlling the process at some stage with non-scientists: lay people or policy makers. The effectiveness of sharing power over a research process in practice depends on the implementation of rules meant to cope with the diversity of competencies among participants including scientists  (Levrel et al. 2009 ). Advocates of participatory research suggest it can overcome some limits of conventional research, particularly as far as complex systems and ""wicked problems"" are concerned  (Fischer 1993) . Learning of participants is not always an objective as such, but exchanging knowledge and various points of view are continuously used to argue for this kind of approach. 
 1.2 However, when participatory research is mentioned, there is not so much being said. Diversity of ways of doing it (or pretending so) is nearly as large as the scope of its expected benefits. This diversity is present on the timing of power devolution over the research process to non scientists, on the level of power devolution including the control over the use of the knowledge produced, on the setting for gathering participants  (Barreteau et al. 2010) . Even with focusing on a specific approach, companion modelling, within a quite cohesive group, one can find a great diversity in the practical details of its implementations  (Barreteau et al. 2011) .This is weakening perspectives of using such research stance in the future due to confusion or even disappointment with past experience among would-be participants. 
 Participatory research as an object of investigation 
 2.1 Scholars are very active in suggesting frameworks to describe participatory research methodologies, but these frameworks do not encompass complex dynamics. Furthermore, they focus on macro-conditions and neglect the micro-level relations among the people who hold the knowledge which is exchanged in these processes, be them scientists or non scientists. Interestingly,  Mertens and colleagues (2005)  explore the inter-individual level of conversations but re-aggregate data in various groups to point out the specific needs for a participatory research to reach all key actors. 
 2.2 As recommended by many authors, some scholars involved in participatory research projects have started to conduct reflexive works  (Etienne 2011; Simon 2004) . Large European projects provide good opportunities to conduct participatory research and reflexive analyses. However these reflexive analyses have mostly also focused on coarse grain level so far. They are rather at the scale of the whole process  (Steyaert et al. 2007 ). Among these, Steyaert and colleagues analyzed the production, the transformation and the flow of knowledge during the entire research process. They point out the necessity of political frames in order to make explicit the role of scientist in a participatory research: providing knowledge, but also facilitating, and sometimes setting the goals for the interaction, due to the overarching importance of scientists' knowledge. Further, an analysis of case studies have shown an asymmetry among disciplines in their capacity to lead such participatory process in multidisciplinary or transdisciplinary setting  (Charles et al. 2008 ). However, they did not go deeper into micro mechanisms to explain how knowledge is expressed, transformed, received, and interpreted. In a participatory process, stakeholders disclose potentially crucial information about themselves to others. This raises some ethical concerns regarding the intervention of scientists. Their work cannot be thought as a separate category of their object of work anymore due to their engagement in a participatory stance. The boundary between realm of management and realm of research is getting blurred. What is going through this boundary? How do interventions of one category modify relations on the other side? 
 2.3 As pointed out through the analysis of several participatory research dealing with adaptive water management on the basis of the FP6 integrated project NeWater, participatory research fits Ostrom's IAD framework  (Ostrom 2005) : knowledge happens to be a strategic shared resource which can take various status, specific participatory events can be analysed as action situations while a whole participatory process would be an action arena. Rules for driving knowledge production and knowledge use constitute the institutional framework, even though they are not always explicit. Using this framework has a triple benefit: (i) it makes explicit the overlapping between action arenas through sharing participants as well as the ambiguities about the status of knowledge as a shared resource, (ii) this framework is already used to understand the dynamics of water management as a shared resource, (iii) it is a framework which has already proved suitable for exploration by social simulation. Therefore even if it is not a framework coming from the field of Science and Technology Studies, we assume that it can help understanding the dynamics of knowledge production over the participatory border and its side effect on the management side. 
 An issue of knowledge flow 3.1 Representation of knowledge flows across this boundary is still a difficult question. Several works have already tried to represent pieces of knowledge as specific entities in the modelling of a system and its dynamics. The representation of knowledge flow processes has been developed in the field of innovation diffusions in the context of corporate businesses  (Sorenson et al. 2006 ). This field focuses on stakes or actors involved. Although authors in this field mention the importance of the topology of relations among actors, they do not explore topologies, as structured as those we can find in participatory settings. They rather explore either random interactions within the population, or the existence of social networks. This trend displays interesting exploration of simulation models with an agent based simulation architecture  (Pyka et al. 2007 ). Science studies provide interesting frames at a coarser grain. Steyaert and his colleagues propose a dual view on knowledge: a thing and a flow. However, they don't explicit their view on knowledge: how it is constituted, and how it is transformed at the nodes of the networks which serve of matrices for the flow  (Steyaert et al. 2007) . Also at the level of framing, with the ""Way of Knowing"" approach, Lejano and Ingram make the point of the interpretation of various pieces of knowledge within a political space in a dynamic way  (Lejano and Ingram 2009) . This means that current political context of a participant in a participatory research will frame his or her way of contributing and receiving what happens in a specific participatory event. 
 3.2 Representation of knowledge in the relation between scientist and policy makers is a little bit more characterised. In her comprehensive literature review, McNie describes knowledge according to 3 characteristics: salience, credibility and legitimacy. This means that knowledge produced by a scientist has to be delivered in the relevant scales and timing, suitable proofs of quality, and free of political biases (McNie 2007). 
 3.3 The other way to characterize knowledge is through its content. In a production oriented view, Sorenson and colleagues consider a piece of knowledge as a recipe, with ingredients, whose interactions make the final product when applying knowledge  (Sorenson et al. 2006 ). This entails considering the complexity of a given piece of knowledge, and thus the difficulty to transmit it without irremediable errors. 
 3.4 At a finer grain, models of knowledge are represented with abstract vectors made of topics, with a more or less complicated structure  (Parunak et al. 2009 ). In a recent agent based model of diffusion innovation, Pyka and colleagues consider a vector of ""kenes"", which are triplets made of domain of capacity, an ability to perform a project in that domain, and an expertise level in that domain  (Pyka et al. 2007 ). These models implement agents with short-term memory, in order to give more weight to the diffusion among actors. This environment can be refined, and some knowledge on others can be added: Parunak and colleagues add a representation of others to give preferences to agents in the selection of other agents to interact with  (Parunak et al. 2009 ). 
 3.5 Knowledge dynamics is then described through processes involving various sources of knowledge and/or processes involving observations on the ""real"" world. Once received, knowledge goes through a trial and error process  (Sorenson et al. 2006) . As far as innovation diffusion is concerned, knowledge is assessed according to what it made possible as new type goods. Hence, trial comes through the quality of the goods which may be produced according to the new pieces of knowledge acquired as well as to the financial benefits they may generate  (Pyka et al. 2007 ). At the other extreme of the range, opinion dynamics models consider only opinion of others: an agent will incorporate opinions of others if it turns out being the opinion of a majority  (Parunak et al. 2009 ). In this case the context, or the topology of the social system, is crucial to understand the subset of actors which will provide the opinions. Further, in their work regarding cognitive convergence, Parunak and colleagues consider a finite set of possible domain of opinions. They assume implicitly that actors who consider that a domain is not valuable know that this domain exists and that others may have a different opinion. This can't match systems with radical uncertainties  (Funtowicz and Ravetz 1993; Pellizzoni 2003)  such as those at stake in most participatory research situations. 
 Towards social simulation of knowledge flows in participatory research 
 4.1 Context plays also a role in reception of knowledge by policy makers at the science/policy interface. Jones identifies four conditions for an effective reception and integration of new knowledge: fitness to on going decision processes, compatibility with existing models and policy processes, accessibility for suitable policy makers, and receptivity of policy makers to research results  (Jones et al. 1999) . 
 4.2 This makes the issue of knowledge flows in participatory research an issue of situated action  (Conein and Jacopin 1994; Suchman 1987 ) and windows of opportunity  (Michaels et al. 2006) : the knowledge and the questions put into the group of participants by scientists have to meet all these conditions. Even if case studies are not specifically oriented towards a specific issue to sort out within an ongoing decision process, participants are embedded in decision processes besides their involvement in the participatory research. Within the structure analysed as a suite of action situations  (Ostrom 2005)  and the frame provided by the specific setting  (Dewulf et al. 2007) , participants can handle some parts of their tacit knowledge, while other parts remain out of ""hand""  (Johannessen et al. 2001) . In the situation of (inter)action, participants can be creative. Through the use of boundary objects, this creativity can grow among the collective, along 3 phases: seeding, evolutionary growth and reseeding  (Fischer et al. 2005 ). 
 4.3 Finally a key limit in borrowing from knowledge diffusion processes in corporate business sector relies to the pro-activity of participants. Innovation implies an active search from each participant. Diffusion of knowledge relies mainly on the quality of the communication channel, i.e. on the proximity (social or spatial) between both ends of communication. The existence of such proximity is crucial to facilitate the good understanding of the knowledge transmitted, as long as its complexity falls in a medium range  (Sorenson et al. 2006 ). This limit sets up some constraint for the modelling of knowledge diffusion in participatory setting: representation of action situation has to cover this attitude of active search of participants for new knowledge and the dynamics of proximity relations according to the evolution of interactions. 
 4.4 Therefore with our experience in social simulation and participatory processes, we suggest that the social simulation community takes this specific approach of knowledge production in participatory or collaborative settings as an object because of the ethical issues associated to it. What is the knowledge really produced, to the benefit of whom, and who could control the orientation of the process at tipping points. It can add to existing assessments of participatory research an understanding of their dynamics through ""micromotives"", those which are not necessary aiming at driving the participatory research process but which influence it because of their impact on the conditions for it to unfold. Existing social simulation of knowledge diffusion in business context, institutional frameworks to provide suitable categories at the interface of research and management, and behavioural patterns as situated action proposed by Science and Technology Studies trends constitute a theoretical basis to deal with social simulation of participatory research. Existing description of past participatory research such as those done by the Companion Modelling group (Etienne 2011) or recent EU projects can provide the empirical basis. These have actually started this work with an initial conceptual prototype of a companion modelling process for example  (Barreteau et al. 2011 ). However they are mainly based on a reflexive stance which needs now an external point of view to strengthen the formal description of a participatory research process. 			 http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/14/4/12.html"

 Background Tsetse flies (Diptera: Glossinidae) are the main vectors of trypanosomes (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae), which cause human and animal trypanosomiases in subsaharan Africa. These diseases have a considerable impact on public health and economic development  [1] , although there are recent signs of a decline in incidence of the human disease following WHO-supported interventions based on case detection and treatment  [2] [3] [4] . Vector control is an important complement to case detection and treatment, because reducing vector density can rapidly halt human trypanosomiasis transmission  [5, 6] . Vector control also remains the only strategy able to protect humans from acquiring a new infection  [7] . Tsetse populations may be reduced using a variety of techniques, including insecticide impregnated traps and targets, live-baits, sequential aerial spraying, and sterile male release  [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . However, in many cases when the control efforts have been stopped, the tsetse populations tend to recover due to flies surviving the initial interventions, or migrant flies coming from untreated regions, or both. This has fueled debate as to whether in some instances ""eradication"" (defined by FAO as the creation of a tsetse free zone) may be more cost-effective than ""suppression"" where tsetse densities are reduced to a level minimizing the risk of disease transmission. Decisions on eradication or suppression strategies will be facilitated when the population structure within the target region, in particular the degree of genetic isolation of the target population from adjacent populations is clearly understood  [14] . For isolated populations, eradication may be the most cost-effective strategy, as reported for Glossina austeni Newstead on Unguja Island, Zanzibar  [9] . But for most mainland populations of tsetse, the geographical limits of target tsetse populations are less easily defined. Application of techniques that can detect population isolation such as molecular or morphometric markers can guide decisions on the choice of control strategies  [15] [16] [17] . Human and animal trypanosomiasis transmitted by G. p. palpalis are known to be present in Ivory Coast  [4, 18]  and G. p. palpalis has been reported to occur within the city of Abidjan  [19, 20] . Due to its potential danger as a vector of human and animal trypanosomiasis, the Ivorian authorities now seek to control these tsetse flies in the affected area of Abidjan, which includes the Banco forest, the University of Abobo Adjamé and the zoological park. Tsetse have been found to be present in low to high densities in these 3 sites, and were found infected by various trypanosome species  [19] . To detect possible evidence of isolation between G. p. palpalis populations in the three affected areas within Abidjan, we used both genetic (microsatellite DNA) and phenetic (geometric morphometrics) markers on the same specimens, and compared these populations to G. p. palpalis populations from another area of southern Ivory Coast in the region of Aniassué. The idea was to assess the interest of the faster and much less expensive morphometric approach in providing relevant information about population structure. The expected outcome of this study was to help the national control program to decide which is the best strategy of vector control in the town of Abidjan: can these three localities be treated sequentially (i.e. are the tsetse populations isolated between the three sites), or should they be taken as one area comprising a single, panmictic population? 
 Results and discussion Microsatellite DNA markers Overall F is values were 0.12, 0.09 and 0.05 for Banco, University, and Zoo, significant at p<0.0001, p<0.001, and p<0.05 respectively. In Aniassué, F is was 0.15, p<0.0001. The heterozygote deficit was mainly due to two loci (PgP1 and B110) for the three populations of Abidjan (  Figure 1 ). This suggested locus had specific technical problems (e.g. null alleles or short allele dominance), because when these loci were removed from the analysis, F is values dropped to non-significant values (0.04, 0.00 and 0.03, respectively). Hence the null hypothesis of panmixia in Abidjan could not be rejected. In Aniassué, F is on these 5 loci was 0.18 (p<0.0001), indicating consistant heterozygote deficiency. The heterozygote deficiency found in Aniassué confirmed earlier observations on G. p. palpalis in the forested areas of Ivory Coast, which attributed such deficiency to a combination of null alleles and genetic structuring at local scale due to Wahlund effects  [21] . 
 Within sample analyses 
 Genetic differentiation between samples The mean F st value for the 5 loci among the four populations was estimated at θ = 0.017 (CI95: 0.011 < θ < 0.023), p<0.0001. For the Abidjan samples it was θ = 0.007 (CI95: 0.00150 < θ < 0.01184) and was not significant, meaning that most of the differentiation was due to differences between Aniassué and Abidjan. Looking at paired F st values between sites  (Table 1)  confirmed this, since the highest (and significant) values always included Aniassué. Within Abidjan, there was a slight but non-significant trend for the population of Banco to diverge (F st =0.01, p<0.05) from those of University and Zoo, whereas the latter two were genetically similar.  
 Geometric morphometrics Size: centroid size The specimens from Aniassué were significantly smaller compared to those from Abidjan, whereas within Abidjan there was no significant size difference between flies from the three sites (  Figure 2 ).  
 Shape variation The first two discriminant factors derived from the shape variables showed that the polygon representing the Aniassué population tended to separate from the Abidjan sites (  Figure 3 ). The reclassification tree, based on all three of the discriminant factors, clearly separated the Aniassué sample from those from Abidjan (  Figure 4) .    (Table 1)  were not significantly different, indicating an absence of shape differentiation, while the Mahalanobis distances from Aniassué were significantly larger (p<0.007) (  Table 1) . The validated reclassification scores confirmed this pattern, since Aniassué had the highest score (86%). However, in spite of the lack of significant differentiation within Abidjan, the reclassification score obtained for Banco (77%) was much higher than for the University (37%) and Zoo (33%), suggesting a relatively higher level of shape divergence in the Banco forest. Correlation between metric and genetic distances was high. Regression of the Mahalanobis distances on the genetic distances indicated that 79% of the morphometric variation could be explained by the genetic variation (  Figure 5 ).  
 Genetic and morphometric differentiation From an epidemiological point of view, our study aimed at knowing whether tsetse populations from three sites in Abidjan could be considered to be isolated from each other. Such information is relevant for designing an adequate tsetse control strategy. For example, an insecticide application could be sequential in case of separation between sites, working on each site separately without risk of reinvasion to the next, or it should simultaneously cover all three sites if no evidence for separation is found. We used a population genetics approach  [7]  to analyse possible separation between the three Abidjan populations, comparing genetic and phenetic markers. Thus, the study also tested the potential of geometric morphometrics as a possible surrogate for molecular markers. Both the phenetic (geometric morphometrics) and genetic (microsatellite loci) markers showed no evidence for differentiation between G. p. palpalis from sites within Abidjan, but both markers agreed in showing strong differentiation between individuals from Aniassué and those from Abidjan. 
 Within Abidjan At the scale of Abidjan, our data showed that males from the three sites showed no genetic differentiation, and accordingly had similar metric properties (size and shape). The microsatellite markers did not show any significant departure from the null hypothesis of panmixia, i.e. we did not observe any genetic differentiation between the 3 populations within Abidjan. There was however a slight, non significant trend for the population of Banco to diverge from the two others. A possible explanation is then a slow, on-going process for this population of Banco to have less genetic exchanges with the two others, due to urbanization which restricts tsetse movements. It may be possible, as observed in other studies in Burkina Faso, that the molecular markers used are not sensitive enough to detect it, since this is a recent, on-going phenomenon whereas what the molecular markers show is the result of a genetic history over several generations. This lack of sensitivity of molecular markers for recent genetic changes has already been observed in tsetse studies  [22] , and may be compensated by the use of morphometrics. This idea is reflected by the much higher shape-based reclassification score obtained for Banco (77%), compared to the two other sites (37% and 33%). This indirect evidence for some morphometric specificity in the forest might be due to an environmental effect (""forest"" versus ""city""), although in tsetse most of the pre-imago development is relatively protected from external influences as tsetse larvae grow in the uterus of their mother during the three first stages, buffering morphometric variations against external influences  [23] . Temperature and humidity do become influential factors at the time when pupae are in the soil. The effect has been studied for size (not shape), indicating that higher temperatures tend to result in smaller individuals  [23] , whereas increasing humidity tends to result in larger individuals  [24] . It has been shown that the size of G. p. palpalis in forested areas of Ivory Coast is governed by seasonal climatic effects  [25] . In Abidjan, no size difference was detected between sites, and given their proximity it seems likely that environmental factors acted uniformly on size. 
 Between Abidjan and Aniassué By contrast, both molecular (microsatellite loci) and morphometric (centroid size and shape variables) data showed significant differences between tsetse from Abidjan and Aniassué. This was expected due to the geographic distance between the two sites (186 km), to the differences of biotopes, and to the fact that the tsetse belt in South Ivory Coast is discontinuous as a consequence of anthropic pressure on habitats. The tsetse from Aniassué were smaller than those from Abidjan. This was in agreement with both the slightly higher temperature  [23]  and dryer conditions  [24, 26]  in Aniassué. The differences between G. p. palpalis from Abidjan and Aniassué also involved shape, which may reflect genetic variations  [23, 27] , especially when shape is allometry-free  [28] [29] [30] . This was confirmed by differences found using microsatellite DNA markers. The parallel between phenetic and genetic markers applied to natural populations is not uncommon  [30] ; for G. p. gambiensis, a similar parallel was observed in natural populations of different biotopes from West Africa  [31] , Guinea  [15] , Burkina Faso  [32]  and Senegal  [17] . Here, 79% of the variance in Mahalanobis distance could be ""explained"" by genetic variation (compared to 50% in study by  [17] ) study). This correlation does not imply a causal relationship, and could be attributed to both phenetic and genetic distances being related to geographical distances  [33] . The heterozygote deficits found in Aniassué confirmed earlier observations on G. p. palpalis in the forested areas of Ivory Coast, which attributed such deficits to a combination of null alleles and genetic structuring at local scale due to Wahlund effects  [21] . 
 Conclusions How can the knowledge of population structure help to choose a control strategy? Since microsatellite and morphometric markers did not show significant differentiation between tsetse from the three sites in Abidjan, there would appear to be no significant barrier to gene flow at this scale. From a control perspective, this means that intervention against tsetse in any one site is likely to face reinvasion from the other two. This is different from a similar study conducted on the Loos archipelago, Guinea, which showed that tsetse populations (G. palpalis gambiensis) were isolated from the mainland and structured according to the island  [15, 34] , which then allowed a sequential control strategy to be implemented  [16, 35] . Successful control of tsetse in Abidjan however, would require all three sites to be considered together  (Figure 6 ), either by deploying control measures simultaneously in all three sites, or by a continuous progression of interventions -for example using barriers of impregnated traps and/or targets between sites  (Figure 7 ) following the ""rolling carpet"" principle  [36] .   Figure 7  The ""rolling carpet"" principle. Eradication strategy in stages, site after site, but by creating barriers with traps or impregnated screens between Zoo and University (barrier C), University and Banco (barrier B), using the ""rolling carpet"" principle  (Vreysen et al., 2007) .

 Methods 
 Study area In Abidjan, the three study sites were the Banco forest (Banco), the University of Abobo Adjamé (University) and the zoological park (Zoo). The Banco forest is in the north-western part of the city of Abidjan, at 5°N latitude and 4°W longitude. East of Banco are two small relicts of the forest which have now been substantially degraded by urbanisation: the Abobo Adjamé University and the zoo of Abidjan. These three sites, although geographically close (less than 500 meters between sites), are separated by roads and urbanisation (  Figure 8 ). For comparison, another study site was chosen near the town of Aniassué, about 186 km from Abidjan, in the Department of Abengourou, where G. p. palpalis occurs along the Comoé river. This region is characterized by forest degraded by wood cutting, and also by food crops (banana, cassava) and old cocoa plantations. There is little temperature difference between Abidjan (from 24.2°C to 27.7°C) and Aniassué (from 24.3°C to 27.9°C), but relatively more variation in relative humidity (RH), which decreases from south (RH on average 90%) to north (RH between 60% and 70%). In both areas, there are two rainy and two dry seasons during a year  [37] . 
 Tsetse samples and microsatellite DNA markers Tsetse flies were caught using Vavoua traps  [38]  in April 2007 in Aniassué and in October 2007 in Abidjan. In total from Abidjan 111 individual tsetse were analysed using microsatellite DNA markers: Banco (25 females (F), 11 males (M)); University  (21 F, 17 M)  and Zoo  (21 F, 16 M) . From Aniassué, 30 individuals were analysed  (15 F and 15 M) . Seven microsatellite markers were used (preceded by ""X"" for X-linked loci): Pgp1, XPgp13, Pgp24  [39] , XB104, XB110, C102 (A. Robinson, FAO/IAEA, pers. com.) and GPCAG  [40] . The samples were processed for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and genotyping on a 4300 DNA Analysis System from LI-COR (Lincoln, NE) as described in  [34] . 
 Population genetics analyses on molecular markers Wright's F-statistics  [41] , the parameters most widely used to describe population genetic structure, were initially defined for a three-level hierarchical population structure (individuals, sub-populations, and total). In such a structure, three fixation indices or F-statistics can be defined. F is is a measure of the inbreeding of individuals (hence I) resulting from non-random union of gametes within each sub-population (hence S). F st quantifies the differentiation between subpopulations in the total population (hence S and T) as a measure of the relatedness between individuals resulting from non-random distribution of individuals between sub-populations, relative to the total population. F it is a measure of the inbreeding of individuals resulting both from non-random union of gametes within sub-populations, and from population structuring (deviation from panmixia of all individuals of the total population, hence I and T). These F-statistics were estimated by Weir and Cockerham 's unbiased estimators f (for F is ), θ (for F st ) and F (for F it )  [42] . The significance of the F-statistics was tested by 1000 random permutations in each case. The significance of F is was tested by randomizing alleles between individuals within sub-samples. The significance of F st was tested by randomizing individuals among sub-samples. 
 Geometric morphometrics analyses The tsetse specimens used for geometric morphometrics constituted a subsample of those on which the molecular analyses were done. Out of the 111 flies used for microsatellites, 55 had non-damaged wings allowing morphometric analyses. The analyses were conducted only on males, and focused on the right wing, which was generally the wing in best conditions. A total of 55 right wings of G. p. palpalis males (M) were used, i.e. 9 from Banco, 16 from University, 15 from Zoo and 15 from Aniassué. Wings were dry-mounted between two microscope slides and scanned at 1800 ppp at dimensions of 0.90 x 0.50 cm, using a multifunction scanner HP Deskjet F 2180. From this picture, the coordinates of 10 landmarks (LM) defined by vein intersections were recorded for each wing, by the same person in the same order (  Figure 9 ). Repeatability was estimated at better than 80% (discussed elsewhere:  [43] ). Raw coordinates were superimposed using the Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA)  [44, 45] , producing one variable for size and 16 variables for shape. The size variable was the isometric estimator known as centroid size (CS) derived from coordinate data and defined as the square root of the sum of the squared distances between the center of the configuration of landmarks, and each individual landmark  [46] . Statistical significance for size comparisons was estimated by 1,000 permutation tests  [47]  with Bonferroni correction. The 16 shape variables were the ""partial warps"" (PW). To circumvent the problem of small sample sizes relative to the large number of shape variables (16 PW), we used the first 6 principal components of the PW (relative warps, RW) as input for discriminant analyses, as these represented 84% of the total variation and had the highest discriminatory power  [48] . Mahalanobis distances  [49]  computed from these 6 RW were used to quantify shape divergence between groups (  Figure 4 ) and the statistical significance was estimated by 1000 permutation tests  [50]  with Bonferroni correction. Mahalanobis distances based re-classification scores were computed according to a validation procedure whereby each individual was assigned to its closest group without using that individual to help determine a group centre  [33] , although the computed shape variables did include that individual  [43]  (  Table 2) .  
 Software Collections of anatomical landmarks of the wings, general Procrustes analysis (GPA), multivariate and discriminant analyses, were performed using the CLIC package  [43] , freely available at http://www.mpl.ird.fr/morphometrics/clic/index.html. PHYLIP software with ""neighbor"" module  [51]  and NJPLOT  [52]  were used to build the classification tree. The F-statistics from molecular data were estimated with Genetix  [53]  and Fstat 2.9.3.2 (updated from  [54] ). The overall G-test was used to estimate the significance of F st with Fstat  [55] .         For the total sample (n = 141) of genotyped tsetse, the seven microsatellite loci displayed 17 (Pgp1), 17 (PgP13), 14 (PgP24), 25 (B104), 19 (B110), 7 (C102), and 9 (GPCAG) alleles, respectively. The mean number of alleles was 9.71 (Banco), 11 (University) and 10.85 (Zoo) in Abidjan, and 10.00 in Aniassué. Mean observed heterozygosities were 0.68, 0.76 and 0.77 for Banco, University and Zoo, respectively, and 0.70 in Aniassué (no significant difference).

In Cameroon, this vegetable has a place in the daily food menu of people and its annual consumption is about 90 000 tons/year. Despite the estimated production of 119,638 tons per year, Cameroon cannot always ensure its self-sufficiency in consumption of onions due to post-harvest losses that reach approximately 40% of total production [1, 2, 3]. These losses are due among others to the lack of infrastructure and appropriate technology for the conservation of onion, at its seasonal production and especially to its high perishability. In order to make the sector more efficient and reduce postharvest losses, efforts could focus on the development of processing technology, on stabilization of onions such as onion powder, for the sale and consumption throughout the year. But several questions arise about the effects of drying on functional properties, including its influence on their antioxidant properties. Indeed, several prospective studies and epidemiological studies confirmed the antioxidant power of onion which reflected its ability to reduce the incidence of several types of diseases related to oxidative stress [4-7]. Moreover, in recent years, several national research centers have focused their work in promoting and enhancing the therapeutic potential of many foods in the country [8]. 
 Figure 1 : 1 White to the laboratory, the onion bulbs were cleared of dry dandruff, roots and crown. Cleaning operation was done manually using a stainless steel knife. The bulbs were then trimmed and washed thoroughly cleaned from impurities (earth, fragments of dry dandruff 
 adjusted to 100 mL by addition of extracting solvent. Aliquots of 2.5 mL were transferred into 50 mL volumetric flasks and their volumes made up of water level in the spices was determined by the method of [15]. Following this method, 1g of sample was weighed in a 50 mL volumetric flask followed by the addition 25 mL of 1% HCl (in methanol). After 30 min of agitation, the mixture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm/min during 10 min and the supernatant collected and used for the assay of its tannin content. In short, 1 mL of extract was mixed with 5 mL of reactive reagent (50 g of vanillin and 4 mL of hydrochloric acid/in 100 mL distilled water) and the mixture incubated at 30°C for 20 min at ambient temperature, and the absorbance read at 500 nm. The amount of tannins was calculated from the calibration curve of tannic acid standard solutions, and 
 [ 16 ] 100 Ferric 16100 . 0.3 mL of solution of radical DPPH 10mM, 2.4 mL of ethanol at 99% and 0.3 mL of the sample extract were rigorously and quickly mixed. The scavenging capacity was evaluated by spectrophotometry at 517 nm. The trolox was used as positive control.DPPH (%) = [(ODcontrol-ODassay)/ (ODinitial)] x Iron Reducing Activity (FIRA)The antioxidant potential of the different spice extracts was also evaluated by their ability to reduce iron (III) to iron (II)following the method of [17].

 mg) of the value lower. This property is due to the high number of hydroxyl groups they contain in their aromatic constituents [27]. Recent studies conducted in Cameroon [12, 28] have shown that certain herbs and spices also have a strong reducing power. Drying causes a significant increase (P ≤ 0.05) in total reducing power, especially sun drying. This increase is seen more in varieties of white of Galmi and violet of Galmi. The same results were obtained by [29] in their work on the drying of garlic and could be explained by the appearance of aromatic compounds responsible for the strong smell of products derived from non-enzymatic browning and have antioxidant properties [30].

This analysis was conducted for the purpose of the linkages between the elements analyzed: antioxidant potential and radical-scavenging activity of onion samples determined by different methods. 
 fact that flavonoids constitute one of the largest groups of total phenolic compounds [37]. The PCA can also better visualize individuals (powdered samples of onions) on a shaft, which can be in the map reproduced in this plane axis, a sample relative to another. For this, samples presented with similar variables will be located very close together, unlike those who are different.Figure 1 shows the mapping of samples of onions in terms of F1 and F2 axis which explains 82.65 % of the results. Axis F1 alone explains 61.65 % of the results expressed, and the axis F2 explains 21.00 %. On this map, we can observe that the samples of onions VGS (violet of Galmi dried in sun) and VGV (violet of Galmi dried in the electrical ventilation) are close; it could mean they have similar variables. This reconciliation is also observed for samples of onions Gs (Goudami dried in the sun), Gv (Goudami dried in the electric ventilation) and BGs (White of Galmi dried in the sun). On the other hand, figure 2 brings out the correlation between the different variables analyzed. We can note the proximity of the variables between TN, TRP, ABTS and TPC and between Vit. C, FL, and DPPH. This closely materializes their inter-correlation. Furthermore, these variables analyzed are strongly correlated with the F1 axis and explains 61.65 % of our results.

 Figure 5 : 5 Correlation Circles of the Phenols and Antioxidant Variables on Varimax Rotated F1xF2 Plans CONCLUSION This study was aimed at evaluating the effect of drying on the antioxidant properties of three varieties of onion (Allium cepa L) grown in Maroua. It appears from this study that the antioxidant power varies from one variety of onion to another; White of Galmi showed the lowest power while Violet of Galmi showed the highest. We also noted that the drying of onion lowers its antioxidant in vitro, but the variety of Violet of Galmi better preserves the antioxidant activity after drying. However, despite the loss of certain bioactive compounds found during the drying, onion powder continues to have a significant antioxidant activity. As a result, onion powder would then be able to assist us in preventing the harmful effects of free radicals. Given these results, several efforts could be made in the popularization of cultivation of the onion Violet of Galmi which presented a strong antioxidant activity compared to the other two varieties of onions studied. Similarly, other studies need to be undertaken to complete this work and encourage the development of an efficient processing technology of onion drying in order to significantly reduce post-harvest losses.INPL, Nancy-Université, France. 
 Table 1 1 the fresh varieties (Table 1). The varieties Violet of Galmi and Goudami were the richest in flavonoids and this could be linked to their strong coloration. Indeed, the color of certain fruits and vegetables is attributed to flavonoids and intensity of this coloration is strongly correlated with the flavonoid content [21]. Analysis of variance shows a significant decrease (P ≤ 0.05) of the flavonoid content in all varieties after drying. This decline was more discernible during drying under the sun for violet of Galmi but was not significant for Goudami Galmi, there is a significant decrease (P ≤ 0.05) of the flavonoid content during drying and this decrease is more pronounced during drying by ventilation. The decrease in The amount of tannins determined by the method using vanillin varied significantly (P ≤ 0.05) between varieties of onion bulbs. The values ranged from 13.28 ± 0.43 mg (Goudami) and 22.52 ± 0.50 mg (violet of Galmi) per 100 g DM (Table 1). After drying, there is a decrease in tannin content in the varieties Goudami, Violet of Galmi dried under the sun and in the White of Galmi dried by ventilation. This decrease was not significant in the variety Goudami whatever the treatment. The temperature rise during drying can lead to a deterioration of tannins [22]. Similarly, hydrolysis and oxidation of tannins [23] that may occur during drying justify the decrease in tannin content observed in the onion powder. However, the increasing quantity of tannins found in varieties of white and violet of Galmi dried under the sun and by electrical ventilation respectively may be due to the hydrolysis of tannins complexed. In effect, the tannins come in two forms in foods: a free form and complexed form with other polymers. It should be noted that enzymes shows the measured levels of total 

phenols using Folin-Ciocalteu method. Total 

phenols ranged from 280.11 ± 6.28 mg 

(White of Galmi) to 982.03 ± 5.57 mg 

(violet) per 100 g dry matter (DM) for the 

fresh varieties, 208.92 ± 6.02 mg (White of 

Galmi) to 948.42 ± 3.20 mg (violet) per 100 

g DM for varieties dried by electrical 

ventilation and 312.42 ± 14, 12 mg (White 

of Galmi) to 852.75 ± 9.20 mg (violet of 

Galmi) per 100 g dry matter for varieties 

dried under sun. In general, the analysis of 

variance shows a significant decrease (P ≤ 

0.05) in total phenolic content of purple 

varieties (Violet of Galmi and Goudami) 

after drying, this decline was more 

pronounced 
with solar drying. In fact, 

during drying, the temperature favors 

decomposition (enzymatic and chemical) 

reactions in the food resulting by loss of 

some phenolic compounds by volatilization 

and thermal decomposition. This mechanism 

might be the main reason that could explain 

the decrease in total polyphenol content 

during drying, as suggested by [20] in his 

work on grain fruit drying. Moreover, with 

the variety White of Galmi, there is a 

significant decrease (P ≤ 0.05) in total 

phenolic content during drying by 

ventilation. But a significant increase (P ≤ 

0.05) during the solar drying was observed. 

This increase could be due to the formation 

of phenolic compounds by the reactions of 

non-enzymatic browning (NEB) during 

drying. Indeed, the chemical composition of 

the plant and the drying temperature could 

be important factors contributing to the 

increase in total polyphenol obtained during 

drying [20]. 

Flavonoids 

The levels of flavonoids measured ranged 

from 67.67 ± 2.45 mg (White Galmi) to 

358.60 ± 0.31 mg (violet) per 100 g DM for

relationships between different variables. 

With this, it appears that the methods used 

to determine the antioxidant capacity 

correlated positively and significantly. There 

is a correlation between ABTS and TRP (R 2 

= 0.643, P ≤ 0.05), DPPH and PRT (R 2 = 

0.542, P ≤ 0.05). These results are consistent 

with those of [12] who have found a good 

correlation between the TRP and ABTS 

methods (R 2 = 0.93, P ≤ 0.05), DPPH and 

 
 Table 5 and 5 Figures 4 and 5 were used to 

highlight the contribution of each sample on 

different axes (F1 and F2). Only samples 

with at least 11.11% of contribution of each 

axis are considered significant. However, it 

appears from this table that the samples 

BGV (94%), BGs (40.20%) and contribute 

more negatively to the construction of the 

F1 axis, in contrast to VGF samples 

(75.60%), VGV (33.20%) which are 

contributing positively. On the F2axis, the 

samples were BGF (62.10%) and Gf 

(58.80%) and contribute more negatively

Using a Wild Synthetic and QTL Mapping for Plant Morphology,,"Introduction Wild relatives of crop plants are sources of useful agriculturally interesting traits that can be tapped to improve the cultivated species  [1, 2] . Historically, the transfer of traits from wild to cultivated species was reported to be a labor intensive and timeconsuming process that required several backcrosses and was often unsuccessful  [3, 4] . The advent of map-based molecular markers and the related quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping approach allowed the development of new molecular breeding strategies to efficiently exploit the positive alleles remaining in the wild species. The development of interspecific introgression line (IL) libraries monitored by molecular markers allows the representation of the entire wild species genome in a set of lines each of which carries one or few wild donor segments in the genetic background of a cultivated species  [3, 5] . These lines are especially useful for mapping complex traits, as they are permanent populations that can be phenotyped in several environments. Moreover, the effects of the alleles of the wild donor parent are evaluated in a homogeneous cultivated genetic background that reduces the interactions between donor alleles  [6, 7] . Finally, the introgression lines are useful starting points for breeding  [2]  and for mapping genes underlying QTLs  [6, 8] . Since the pioneering work in tomato  [9] , several interspecific introgression line libraries with different names but the same genetic construction have been produced for many crops: Chromosome Segment Substitution Lines (CSSLs) for rice  [5, 6] , Backcross Inbred Lines (BILs) for lettuce  [10] , Backcross Recombinant Inbred Lines (BCRILs), Introgression Lines (ILs), Near Isogenic Lines (NILs) or QTL-NILs for tomato and barley  [9, [11] [12] [13] [14] . Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is an allotetraploid (2n = 4x = 40) tropical legume that is native to South America and has an AB genome. The speciation of cultivated peanut was associated with a change in ploidy level (diploid to allotetraploid), creating reproductive isolation from its wild relatives. This speciation process superimposed with domestication has contributed to the narrow the genetic basis of cultivated peanut. Peanut wild relatives have long been identified as important sources of interesting traits such as disease resistance  [15, 16] . However, the genetic barrier between wild and cultivated peanut species caused by ploidy differences has hampered the use of wild diploid relatives in peanut breeding programs. Nevertheless, disease resistance genes have been successfully transferred from wild diploid peanut species to cultivated tetraploid species  [17] [18] [19] . In the last decade, tremendous efforts have been invested in the development of molecular tools for genetic studies in peanut. Thousands of Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers have been developed and used for genetic map construction and QTL mapping, mainly in intraspecific crosses  [20, 21] . In peanut interspecific cultivated6wild crosses, molecular markers have been used as to evaluate the extent of wild chromosome introgressions into the genetic background of cultivated species a posteriori  [22] , or to identify introgressed wild genomic regions that carry disease resistance genes  [4, 23] . However, there has been little progress with respect to the integration of molecular markers during the process of alien gene transfer in peanut breeding programs. Thus, there is still a gap to fill by systematizing the use of molecular markers during alien gene transfer and, more generally, by developing permanent interspecific QTL mapping populations such as CSSLs in peanut. We have recently developed an SSR-based genetic linkage map using a BC 1 F 1 population derived from the cross between the cultivated Fleur11 variety and the synthetic allotetraploid (A. ipaënsis6A. duranensis) 4x  [24] . We have also produced an advanced-backcross QTL (AB-QTL) population from the same cross and identified several wild alleles that contribute positive variation to complex traits  [25] . Here, as a follow-up to these studies, we report the development of a CSSL population. As a first example of the utility of this population, we have mapped several QTLs involved in peanut morphology. The potential of this CSSL population for deciphering the molecular basis of complex traits is also discussed. 
 Materials and Methods 
 Plant Material The parents of this study were the synthetic wild allotetraploid [A. ipaënsis KG30076 (diploid BB genome)6A. duranensis V14167 (diploid AA genome)] 4x  [26]  used as the donor parent and the cultivated Fleur11 variety used as the recurrent parent. This synthetic allotetraploid, which combines the A and B genomes of the most probable wild ancestor of cultivated peanut was kindly provided by EMBRAPA in the framework of the Generation Challenge Program (GCP) consortium. Selected agro-morphological characteristics of the wild diploid parents A. ipaënsis and A. duranensis and the cultivated Fleur11 variety are shown in  Table 1 . A BC 4 F 3 population was produced by four successive backcross generations of selected BC s individuals (from BC 1 F 1 to BC 4 F 1 ) to the Fleur11 variety followed by two generations of selffertilization (from BC 4 F 1 to BC 4 F 3 ). All crosses were performed under greenhouse conditions at the Centre d'Etudes Régional pour l'Amelioration de l'Adaptation à la Sécheresse (CERAAS, Senegal) between 2006 and 2010. The Fleur11 variety was used as female parent to produce the F 1 , BC 1 F 1 and BC 2 F 1 generations and as male to produce the BC 3 F 1 and BC 4 F 1 generations. The day before each crossing experiment, the plants used as female parent were manually emasculated. The crosses were performed early in the morning from 6 am to 10 am by capping the pollen sacs of the flowers of the male parent on the pistils of the female parent. Flowers that had not been pollinated were removed manually. The crossing scheme and the timeline used to generate the CSSL population are shown in  Figure 1 . 
 DNA Isolation At each generation, 3 to 30 seeds from selected BC n (depending on the number of seeds available and on the number of wild chromosome segments to be derived from each individual) were sown in large deep pots in the greenhouse. One seed was sown per pot. Young leaves were harvested from 10-15 day old plants and immediately stored at 4uC on ice before drying. DNA was extracted from 20 mg of dried leaves following a slightly modified mixed alkyltrimethylammonium bromide (MATAB) protocol  [27] . Briefly, leaves were ground in quartz sand using a mortar and pestle or using a Mixer Mill (MM301, Retsch) and dissolved in 750 mL of MATAB buffer at 74uC. The samples were incubated for 20 minutes at 74uC and cooled for 5 minutes at room temperature. Then, 750 mL of chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (CIA) (24:1) was added to each sample. All samples were homogenized by gentle shaking before centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 minutes. The supernatant was collected and the DNA was precipitated with 600 mL of isopropanol. After centrifugation, pellets were washed with 300 mL of 70% ethanol, air dried and dissolved in 500 mL of Tris-EDTA.  
 Microsatellite Analysis An SSR-based genetic linkage map based on 88 BC 1 F 1 individuals was produced previously  [24] . A framework map of 115 SSR markers that amplified 147 loci was derived from this map. Compared to the initial map, the framework map offered regular coverage of all of the linkage groups, with an average of one marker per 12 cM. These 115 SSR markers were used to genotype individuals in each backcross generation. PCR amplifications were performed in a MJ Research PTC-100 TM thermocycler (Waltham, MA, USA) or in an Eppendorf Mastercycler using 25 ng of DNA in a 10 ml final volume comprising of buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mM KCl, 0.05% w/v gelatin, and 2.0 mM MgCl 2 ), 0.1 mM of the M13tailed primer, 0.1 mM of the other primer, 160 mM of dNTPs, 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, USA), and 0.1 mM of IR700-or IR800-labeled fluorescent M13 primer (MWG, Germany). Touchdown PCR was performed as follows: initial denaturation at 95uC for 1 min; 10 cycles of 94uC for 30 s, Tm (+5uC, 20.5uC/cycle) for 1 min, and 72uC for 1 min; 25 cycles of 94uC for 30 s, Tm for 1 min, and 72uC for 1 min; and a final elongation step at 72uC for 8 min. IR700 or IR800-labeled PCR products were diluted 7-fold and 5-fold, respectively, subjected to electrophoresis in a 6.5% polyacrylamide gel and then sized using the Infra-Red (IR) fluorescence scanning system of the Li-COR sequencer (LI-COR, USA). Images were analyzed using the Jelly 0.1 software (Rami, unpublished) and exported as a data table. 
 Marker-assisted Selection of Individuals at Each Backcross Generation All 115 SSR markers of the framework map were used to genotype a total of 88, 192, and 565 individuals in the BC 1 F 1 , BC 2 F 1 and BC 3 F 1 generations respectively. At each generation, the genotyping data were used to select the individuals used to produce further backcross generations. Selection was performed using the CSSL-finder software  [28] . To identify a minimum subset of individuals providing an optimal coverage of the cultivated peanut genome with chromosome segments from the wild donor, we selected for individuals with multiple target wild chromosome segments of 30 cM length each, forming contiguous overlapping segments between successive lines, and with the best possible recovery of the genetic background of Fleur11. Using these criteria, 22 individuals were selected and backcrossed in the BC 1 F 1 generation, 58 in the BC 2 F 1 generation, and 80 in the BC 3 F 1 generation. In the BC 4 F 1 generation, 807 individuals were genotyped. The genotyping of these individuals was performed in two steps. Because genotypic data were available for the 80 BC 3 F 1 individuals chosen for developing the BC 4 F 1 generation, the chromosomal regions that segregated in BC 4 F 1 individuals were known. Based on this information, foreground selection was first applied to confirm the presence of the target wild chromosome segments in the BC 4 F 1 individuals; 459 individuals were selected. Background selection was then performed on this subset of individuals at specific regions that still contained undesirable wild segments. A new genotypic dataset that summarized the genotypic information produced in the BC 3 F 1 generation and those from the foreground and the background selection produced in the BC 4 F 1 generation was computed. New criteria were added to CSSLfinder to allow redundancy between individuals (i.e., multiple individuals carrying a wild chromosome segment that covers the same genomic region) and to derive only one target wild chromosome segment per line. Finally, using these new criteria, we selected 100 of the 459 BC 4 F 1 individuals for self-fertilization. In the BC 4 F 2 generation, 1180 individuals were genotyped using the foreground selection approach that allowed the identification of 877 individuals carrying a target wild chromosome segment. Background selection was then performed on this subset of individuals. The selection of a final subset of BC 4 F 2 individuals to be self-fertilized was performed manually. We first selected individuals that carried a unique homozygous or heterozygous target wild chromosome segment in a homogeneous Fleur11 genetic background. This first set of lines did not offer sufficient coverage of the genetic map. In order to cover all regions, we also selected individuals that carried one homozygous or heterozygous target wild chromosome segment and only one other heterozygous wild undesirable chromosome segment elsewhere in the genome. We finally selected among the other plants that had multiple wild chromosome segments, the best individuals with three, four or five segments that covered the genomic regions that had not yet been included. A total of 140 individuals were selffertilized to produce the BC 4 F 3 generation. In the BC 4 F 3 generation, 1078 individuals were genotyped using the foreground selection approach, which allowed the identification of 718 individuals that carried homozygous target wild chromosome segment. Background selection on this subset of individuals allowed the final selection of the 122 BC 4 F 3 individuals that were used as our final CSSL population. 
 Phenotyping A subset of 86 CSSLs was selected to provide a minimum set of lines with optimal genome coverage. Six lines could not be included in the phenotyping experiment due to limited seed quantities (12CS_117, 059, 080, 083, 061 and 066) leading to small uncovered regions in linkage groups A06, B04, B07, B08 and  This recording is well adapted for germplasm description but more difficult to use for QTL mapping because of the qualitative nature of the resulting data. Therefore, in our study, the GH trait was represented by the ratio of the length of the creeping part of a given lateral branch to the total length of the lateral branch. This phenotyping method yielded quantitative values that were more suitable for QTL mapping analyses. Main stem height (PH) was measured from the cotyledonary axil to the terminal bud. Finally, plant spread (PS) was measured as the distance between the widest branch tips. All morphological traits were recorded at 55-60 days after sowing. 
 Statistical Analysis Introgression analysis. The frequency of homozygous cultivated Fleur11 and heterozygous wild/cultivated genotypes at each locus was determined for all lines and for the selected lines at each backcross generation (BC 1 F 1 , BC 2 F 1 , BC 3 F 1 and BC 4 F 1 ). The observed homozygous/heterozygous segregation ratio was compared with the expected 0.5, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.0625 ratios in BC 1 F 1 , BC 2 F 1 , BC 3 F 1 and BC 4 F 1 , respectively, using a chi-square test. The percentage of wild genome at each generation was estimated using the ratio of the total length of the introgressed wild segments to the total length of the genetic map. The total length of the introgressed segments was calculated as the sum of consecutive intervals having heterozygous or homozygous wild genotype plus half the size of each flanking interval with a recurrent parent homozygous genotype. Graphical genotypes were drawn using a script written in R (R Development Core Team, 2010). QTL mapping. Basic statistical analyses were performed for each trait. For QTL detection, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was first performed with the SAS software to estimate the genotype and replicate effects on each trait following a standard linear model with genotype, replication, block and interaction effects, as follows: Y ijk~m zG i zr j zb jk ze ijk with Y ijk = the observed value for a given trait, m = mean value of the population, G i = genotype effect, r j = replicate effect, b jk = block within replicate effect and e ijk = residual error. When the analysis revealed a significant difference between genotypes, a Dunnett's multiple comparison  [29]  of differences between the CSSLs and Fleur11 was conducted using the GLM procedure in SAS software. We accepted a QTL in a wild chromosome segment when the trait value of a given line was significantly different from that of Fleur11 (P,0.05). QTLs with effects in the same direction on overlapping or flanking segments between contiguous lines were considered to be the same. The relative effect of a wild introgression in a given line was calculated using the least square means (LSMEANS) output of the GLM procedure as follows: RE~L sMean(IL){LsMean(Fleur11) LsMean(Fleur11) |100 
 Results 
 Population Development The F 1 hybrids between the cultivated Fleur11 variety and the synthetic wild allotetraploid (A. ipaënsis KG300766A. duranensis V14167) 4x exhibited a good level of fertility. The rate of success of  Table 3 . Genotypic features of the progeny of each generation. the hybridization in the backcross experiments was also high, ranging from 75% to 80%. However, individuals resulting from inadvertent self-fertilization, identified by molecular analysis, were observed in some cases. Fleur11 is a short cycle variety, and the interval from sowing to the appearance of the first flowers was 21 days on average. The short duration between sowing and flowering required us to limit the number of individuals to be genotyped per backcross family at each generation. On average, 9.6 individuals (min = 3, max = 30) were genotyped per family and per generation. A wide range of phenotypic variation for traits related to growth habit, pod and seed shape and size was observed between the families in the first backcross generations. We were careful to avoid selection based on plant phenotype during all the process of development of the libraries. However, as we advanced in the backcross generations, most of the families exhibited a phenotype similar to that of the recurrent parent, indicating a progressive recovery of the genetic background of the cultivated variety. Heterozygosity and reduction of the wild genome representation in successive backcross generations. When considering all lines, the observed number of heterozygous loci at the backcross generations BC 1 F 1 , BC 2 F 1 , BC 3 F 1 and BC 4 F 1 was significantly (P,0.01) higher than expected (  Table 2 ). This could be due to the limited number of lines that were genotyped at each generation. The strategy of population development using marker assisted selection allowed us to significantly (P,0.01) reduce the number of heterozygous loci in BC 2 F 1 and BC 3 F 1 generations. This strategy had no significant effect in BC 1 F 1 , due to the low number of lines (22) that were selected, or in BC 4 F 1 , because the heterozygous loci were mainly the target wild chromosome segments. The residual heterozygosity in the CSSLs population was 0.14%. The average donor genome contribution decreased drastically from BC 1 F 1 to BC 4 F 1 (24.6% to 3.0%) and remained stable from BC 4 F 1 to BC 4 F 3 (3.0% to 2.3%), during the fixation of target wild chromosome segments  (Figure 2 ). Number and size of the introgressed segments; genome coverage. Marker assisted selection was applied over six generations, from BC 1 F 1 to BC 4 F 3 , allowing the selection of a set of 122 CSSLs with fixed target wild chromosome segments. The average number of wild donor chromosome segments varied from 17 in BC 1 F 1 to 1.5 in the CSSL population  (Table 3) . Among the 122 CSSLs, 72 lines carried one unique donor segment, 37 lines carried two segments, ten lines carried three segments, one line carried four segments and two lines carried five segments. The estimated length of the wild donor segments varied slightly in the different backcross generations and was, on average, 39.2 cM in the CSSL population  (Table 3) . Among the 122 CSSLs, 42 lines were selected to provide redundancy in some regions of the genome in which several QTLs of agronomic interest had been mapped in a previous study  [25] . This was for example the case for LGs a04, a07, a09, b05, b06 and b10  (Figure 3 ). These lines could be considered potential NILs for these genomic regions. In the CSSL population, most of the target wild chromosome segments overlap, except those between successive lines in LGs a03, a06, a07 and a08 and in LGs b03, b07 and b09  (Figure 3 ). The introgressed segments in the whole CSSL population covered 92.1% of the genetic map. Detailed introgression information for each of the 122 CSSL lines is given in supporting information  Table S1 . 
 Phenotypic Analysis Phenotypic measurements were performed on a subset of 80 CSSLs. Three quantitative traits (GH, PH and PS) and one qualitative trait (YF) were evaluated. The plant growth habit (GH) was measured as the ratio of the length of the creeping part of a given lateral branch to the total length of the lateral branch. The values of the ratio were 0 for an erect growth habit, between 0.16 and 0.5 for decumbent phenotypes, and greater than 0.5 for procumbent phenotypes. The values of the PH and PS traits varied from 7.0 cm to 24.07 cm and from 31.0 cm to 80.4 cm, respectively  (Table 4) . For each trait, the mean of the CSSL population was similar to the mean of the recurrent Fleur11 parent (  Table 4 ). The coefficient of variation for the PS trait was higher in the CSSL population than in Fleur11 (18.0% versus 11.0%). 
 QTL Detection For all traits combined, Dunnett's test revealed a total of 28 lines with significant differences from Fleur11  (Table 5) . Among these lines, fifteen had one unique wild chromosome segment, eleven had two wild segments and three had three wild segments. In cases for which a given line had more than one wild segment, it was not obvious how to assign the QTL to a single chromosome segment. We were, however, able to resolve most of these cases by comparison with lines having overlapping segments and similar phenotypes. When the QTL assignment on a single chromosome segment was still ambiguous, QTLs were considered putative in all segments and consequently not assigned. Finally, with these adjustments, 42 QTLs were detected for all traits. In the following paragraphs, we detail the QTL detection per trait. Growth habit (GH). A total of 20 lines had a significantly different GH compared with Fleur11. The analysis of the line6trait associations allowed the identification of 14 genomic regions containing QTLs. Eleven QTLs were unambiguously mapped to nine linkage groups: a01 (two QTLs), a03 (two QTLs) and LGs a05, a06, a07, b04, b05, b06 and b11 (one QTL each)  (Figure 4) . For two QTLs, the most likely locations were proposed. The lines carrying these QTLs (12CS_104 and 12CS_033) have a procumbent phenotype and carried each a single wild introgression on LGs a10 and b10  (Figure 4) . On LG a10, the wild chromosome segment of line 12CS_104 fully overlaps with that of 12CS_078 and on LG b10, the wild chromosome segment of line 12CS_033 fully overlaps with that of 12CS_014. However, 12CS_078 and 12CS_014 have an erect GH. If we assume that the estimated size of the segments could differ from their real size, because the precise site of recombination is unknown, the most likely locations of the QTLs on LG a10 and b10 are within the regions upstream of the wild segments. The assignment of the remaining QTL was more complicated. For instance, line 12CS_084 carried two wild segments, one of which is located on LG a01 and overlaps with the QTL-carrying segment in line 12CS_016. Thus, these two lines could carry the same QTL. Another wild segment is located on LG a08. This segment partly overlaps with the segments in lines 12CS_101 and 12CS_039. However, these lines have erect GHs. The QTL conferring spreading GH could also be restricted to the non-overlapping region on LG a08. Therefore, this QTL has been considered putative in the a08 linkage group. In most of the lines, wild alleles at the GH QTLs conferred a decumbent phenotype (ratios between 0.16 and 0.5). However, four lines 12CS_022, 12CS_104, 12CS_047 and 12CS_033, contain wild segments on LG a05, a10, b06 and b10 that conferred a procumbent phenotype  (Table 5) . Interestingly, 12CS_022 partly overlaps with 12CS_012, 12CS_009 and 12_CS_116, which each have decumbent phenotypes. These results suggest that two QTLs with different effects could be responsible for GH in these regions, one conferring a procumbent phenotype and the other conferring a decumbent phenotype. Alternatively, these lines might share one common QTL but differ at one additional QTL that could be responsible for growth habit differences. Plant height (PH). A total of 18 lines had main stem height significantly different to that of Fleur11. The analysis of the line6trait associations allowed the identification of 15 genomic regions containing QTLs. Thirteen QTLs were located on ten linkage groups: two QTLs on LG b02, two QTLs on LG b06, 2 QTLs on LG b10 and one QTL each on LGs a01, a03, a05, a07, b03, b05 and b09  (Figure 4) . Two QTLs on LG a02 and a08 were considered as putative. The wild alleles at PH QTLs on LG a01, a03, a05, a07, b05 and b09 were associated with a shorter main stem height, while the two QTLs on LG b02 and one QTL on LG b03 and were associated with an increase in the main stem height  (Table 5) . Two QTLs with opposing effects were also mapped on LG b06 and b10, respectively. Plant spread (PS). A total of 20 lines had plant spread values significantly different from that of Fleur11  (Table 5 ). The line6trait associations allowed the identification of 12 QTLs in 10 linkage groups. Two QTLs were mapped on LG a01, two on LG b06 and one QTL each on LGs a03, a05, a06, a10, b04, b05, b10 and b11  (Figure 4) . The plant-spread QTLs co-segregated either with plant growth habit QTLs or with plant height QTLs. At all QTLs the wild alleles were involved in increasing plant spread. As observed for GH, several lines that have overlapping chromosome segments had also different plant spread. This was the case for successive lines on LG a05 (12CS_022, 12CS_012, 12CS_009 and 12CS_016) and successive lines on LG b10 (12CS_033 and 12CS_014). These results suggest that QTLs with different effects or more than one QTL were responsible for differences in plant spread in these LGs. Flower color (YF). Two lines, 12CS_009 and 12CS_016, had yellow flowers while Fleur11 had orange flowers. These two lines are successive with contiguous overlapping segments on LG a05  (Figure 4 ). Thus the genomic region involved in flower color is restricted to the overlapping region between the fragments on LG a05. 
 Discussion 
 Population Development The CSSL population we have developed offers broad coverage of the genome of cultivated peanut especially in the context of the large genome size (c. 2800 Mb/1C and 20 linkage groups). The level of coverage of the donor genome of our CSSL population compares favorably to that of sets of introgression lines (IL) in other crop species. In tomato, Eshed and Zamir  [9]  reported the development of 50 ILs providing a complete genome coverage using the wild species Lycopersicon pennellii as donor. In two other studies of tomato IL development, the level of genome coverage was 85% and 97.6%, using L. hirsutum  [11]  and L. lycopersicoides  [30] , respectively, as donors. In barley, 86.6% genome coverage was reported in a set of 59 ILs developed from the cross between the wild species Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum and a spring barley cultivar  [31] . Lower levels of genome coverage have also been reported. In peanut, a set of 46 ILs covering 30% of the peanut diploid genome has been developed from a cross between the allotetraploid cultivated species A. hypogaea and the wild diploid species A. cardenasii  [22] . In wheat, a set of 97 ILs covering 37.7% of the donor genome has been produced from the cross between a synthetic hexaploid genotype and a Chinese cultivar  [32] . In the present study, most of the CSSLs (62.3%) contained a single wild fragment in a homogeneous cultivated genetic background. For the lines that contained more than one fragment, additional backcrossing efforts will be necessary to derive lines that harbor unique wild chromosome segments. 
 QTL Mapping In the present study, as a first demonstration of the utility of the CSSL population, four traits were evaluated in a subset of 80 lines. The line6trait associations allowed the identification of a total of 42 QTLs. Among these QTLs, 37 have been unambiguously assigned to a given genomic region notwithstanding the presence of few additional wild chromosome segments in some lines. Probable locations have been proposed for 2 additional QTLs. This was the case for the GH QTLs on LGs a10 and b10, for which the uncovered regions upstream the wild chromosome segments in lines 12CS_104 and 12CS_033 were proposed as the most probable locations of the QTLs. Among the whole CSSL population (122 lines), one line having wild chromosome segments that cover the QTL region on LG b10 has been identified. This line will be used to confirm the location of the QTL. Finally, three QTLs were putatively assigned to different genomic regions. Additional backcrossing efforts will be necessary for the lines carrying these QTLs to eliminate supernumerary wild chromosome segments and clarify the QTL positions. Growth habit is a complex trait governed by several QTLs with different effects. Peanut growth habit has long been studied, mainly in cultivated6cultivated crosses, and one to four genes have been proposed as responsible for this trait  [33] . Geniccytoplasmic interactions involving at least two cytoplasm types and two genes have also been described  [34] . In our recently published study, six QTLs for growth habit have been mapped in an interspecific AB-QTL design involving the same parents as those used in the present study  [25] . In the present study, we mapped 14 QTLs, five of which were common with those mapped in the previous study. The difference in the number of QTLs mapped in the two studies may be related to the higher efficiency of QTL detection using the CSSL population. Indeed, in the AB-QTL population, some QTLs, especially those with smaller effects, were likely masked by QTLs with greater effects. Different numbers of mapped QTLs between population types (CSSL versus AB-QTLs) have also been reported in tomato  [9]  and in rice  [35] . In summary, a greater number of QTLs are involved in peanut growth habit in interspecific crosses than in intraspecific crosses. Moreover, in the CSSL population, we observed that lines might have different wild segments carrying QTLs but similar phenotypes. Analyzing these results in an evolutionary context and assuming that the wild species (A. duranensis and A. ipaënsis) used in this study are the most probable ancestors of cultivated peanut  [36, 37] , raises new questions about the evolution of cultivated peanut during its domestication. Which QTLs/genes involved in GH have been maintained in the cultivated species? Which ones have been lost? Are similar phenotypes explained by the same or different QTLs? Mapping GH QTLs in intraspecific crosses involving various cultivated varieties and comparing them with QTLs mapped in the CSSL population will shed new light on this issue. QTL effects vary between lines with overlapping wild chromosome segments. In the present study, QTLs with effects in the same direction but of different magnitudes as well as QTLs with opposite effects have been detected in successive lines with overlapping wild chromosome segments. For example, this was the case for the successive lines 12CS_022, 12CS_012, 12CS_009 and 12CS_016, which have different GH effects on LG a05 and for the successive lines 12CS_047, 12CS_050 and 12CS_069, which carry PH QTLs with opposite effects on LG b06 (  Table 5 ). The lines 12CS_047 and 12CS_050 have spreading GH with reduced PH, while 12CS_069 has erect GH with increased PH. Interestingly, on LG b06, the line 12CS_076 carries a wild chromosome segment that overlaps with those of 12CS_047, 12CS_050 and 12CS_069  (Figure 4 ). This line has spreading GH and PH similar to that of Fleur11. The PH phenotype of 12CS_076 could be caused by QTLs with opposite effects in this LG corresponding to segments of lines 12CS_050 and 12CS_069. Surprisingly, the relative effect of the GH QTL is of lower magnitude in line 12CS_076 than in 12CS_047 or 12CS_050  (Table 5 ). This result suggests that the QTL involved in increased PH could also have a pleiotropic effect on GH. Assuming that the QTLs involved in main stem height increase have antagonistic effects on those involved in spreading GH, one could expect that the introgression of these QTLs in cultivated runner-type peanut will modify their growth habit. This could be further confirmed by the introgression of wild segments carrying QTLs involved in increasing PH into the genetic background of a runner-type peanut variety. 
 Conclusion In this study, we produced a population of 122 CSSLs with the aim of broadening the gene pool of cultivated peanut. This population has been efficiently used to dissect the genetic architecture of several morphological traits. Plant growth habit for example, which has long been described as a simple trait governed by one to four genes, was found to be affected by several QTLs with different effects. Our findings confirm the efficiency of the CSSL population type for QTL mapping. This CSSL population is a public resource, available upon request, and it will be helpful to the peanut scientific community to better understand the molecular bases of the variation of agriculturally interesting traits.

 B10. The introgressions represented by the final subset of 80 lines covered 88.7% of the genetic map. A field trial involving the 80 selected lines and Fleur11 used as control was conducted from September to December 2011 at the Centre National de Recherche Agronomique (CNRA) in Bambey (14.42uN and 16.28uW), Senegal. The experimental design was an alpha-lattice design with 6 replicates and 6 blocks per replicate. The blocks contained 15 rows of 3 meters each. The 80 CSSL and Fleur11 plants (represented 10 times in each replicate) were arranged in rows of 10 plants. The spacing was 30 cm between plants and 50 cm between rows. Flower color (YF) (orange versus yellow) was rated visually. Peanut growth habit (GH) is usually recorded on a 1-6 scale based on the IBPGR and ICRISAT (1992) descriptors.

In humans, RVF can take different forms  [1] . Most human cases are characterized by a 'dengue-like' illness with moderate fever, joint pain, and headache. In its most severe form, the illness can progress to hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, or ocular disease with significant death rate. In livestock, it causes abortion and high mortality of newborns and thus induces important direct and indirect economic impacts. Since the first isolation of RVFV in Kenya in 1930  [2] , major RVF outbreaks have been reported in Egypt in 1977-1978  [3]  and 1993  [4] , in the Senegal River Valley in 1987  [5, 6] , in Madagascar in 1990  [7]  and 1992  [8] , and in northern  Kenya and Somalia in 1997 , 1998 . In 2000, RVF cases were reported for the first time outside the African continent, in Saudi Arabia and Yemen  [10] . Recently, a new wave of RVF epidemics occurred in 2006 and 2007 in East Africa (Kenya, Somalia and Tanzania)  [11, 12] , in Sudan in 2007  [13] , in Madagascar in 2008  [14] , and in Southern Africa in 2010  [15] . Two main modes of transmission of RVFV are suspected: i) a direct transmission from infected ruminants to healthy ruminants or humans, (ii) an indirect transmission through the bites of infected mosquito vectors  [16] . The respective contribution of these different transmission routes remain unevaluated  [17] . However, it is assumed that the transmission by the bite of infected mosquitoes is the main infection mechanism during interepizootic periods  [18] . The number of mosquito species potentially involved in RVFV transmission is very large (more than 30 species), with the main vectors belonging to the Aedes and Culex genera  [19] . Because mosquitoes are highly dependent on environmental conditions, the distribution in space and time of RVF is also related to climatic and landscape features. Until now, the ecological areas associated with RVFV transmission were either irrigated or flooded areas located in bushed or wooded savannas of semi-arid areas  [20] , although a recent study on RVF outbreaks in Madagascar showed possible transmissions in a temperate and mountainous region  [17] . In semi arid areas, natural water bodies which are generally full during the rainy season allow the development of Aedes and Culex species  [20, 21] . Based on this, climate based models have been developed to predict RVF outbreaks in Eastern Africa  [22, 23] , and a strong correlation was found between extreme rainfall events and RVF outbreak occurrences in the Horn of Africa  [24] . In West Africa, there is strong evidence that the disease is endemic  [18] : different RVF outbreaks were reported in ruminants since the severe outbreak in the Senegal River basin in 1987  [25, 26, 27, 28] , and RVFV was isolated from mosquitoes  [21, 29]    (Figure 1a) . However, using a statistical approach, the correlation found in East Africa is not valid in the semi-arid regions of West Africa  [30, 31]  where the drivers of RVFV transmission dynamics remain poorly understood. There, temporary water bodies (ponds) constitute the main oviposition sites of different mosquito species  [32, 33]  and mosquito population dynamics are assumed to mainly depend on water availability and on pond dynamics, themselves driven by rainfall  [34] . In this study, we use a mechanistic modelling approach to better understand the dynamics of RVF transmission in Northern Senegal, in relation to the population dynamics of its two main mosquito vectors in Senegal, Aedes (Aedimorphus) vexans arabiensis  [21, 33]  and Culex poicilipes  [29] . These two species are considered as the main RVF vector in the area because i) they were proven experimentally to be competent for RVF virus transmission  [35, 36, 37] ; ii) they were frequently found infected in nature and are the most abundant species in our field site  [21, 38] ; iii) their interaction with the RVF vertebrate hosts (sheep, goats, and cattle) is very important  [39] . The dynamics of the two vector species is modelled by combining a hydrological model of the dynamics of the water bodies, with mosquito population models describing different stages of the mosquito life cycle. Once calibrated and validated on recent rainfall, pond water levels, and entomological data, the combined model can be used to simulate the evolution of the two species' populations during the period 1961-2003, using only rainfall data as input. The comparison of model simulations with recorded prevalence rates and RVF outbreaks in the region is then analyzed and discussed. 
 Methods 
 Study area The study area is an agropastoral zone of northern Senegal  (Figure 1b) . It is representative of the Ferlo region and is characterized by a complex and dense network of ponds that are filled during the rainy season (from July to mid-October). These water bodies are focal points where humans and livestock have access to water during the rainy season and are also the main breeding sites for Aedes vexans arabiensis and Culex poicilipes mosquitoes. 
 Hydrologic model overview We used a hydrologic pond model that simulates daily spatial and temporal variations (surface, volume, and height) of temporary ponds in arid areas  [40] . The model consists in a daily water balance model taking into account the contribution from direct rainfall, the runoff volumes of inflows and the water loss through evaporation and infiltration. The relation between water volume, surface and height of a given pond depends on the 3D shape of that pond and is modelled by two volume-depth and area-depth empirical equations. Parameters of the model were estimated using detailed bathymetry of representative ponds of the study area and remotely sensed data such as a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and a very high spatial resolution Quickbird image. The model was calibrated and validated with field data (water height data and shape profile) collected during the rainy season 2001 and 2002 in the Barkedji area. The application of the model to the ponds (98) of the study area gave fair results both for water height and water area predictions. The comparison of simulated and observed water areas show significant correlations with a coefficient of determination (r 2 ) of 0.89. More details of the hydrologic model are given in  [40] . In this study, two sets of rainfall data were used as model input: i) daily rainfall data recorded during the rainy seasons (July-December) 2002 and 2003 with an automatic meteorological collector located in Barkedji village (  Figure 1b) ; and ii) daily rainfall data recorded from January 1961 to December 2001 by the Linguère meteorological station located 30 km from Barkedji (  Figure 1a ). The output of interest of the hydrologic model for modelling mosquito population dynamics is S P t , the water surface of any pond P at time t. 
 Bioecology of Aedes vexans and Culex poicilipes mosquitoes The mosquito life cycle involves aquatic (egg, larva, and pupa) and aerial (adult) stages. It begins with an egg, which hatches as a larva. Depending on the species and environmental conditions, hatching may occur immediately or may be delayed. The larvae then mature through four stages before entering pupation. After pupation, the mosquito emerges as an adult (imago) at the surface of water. Adults rapidly mate after emergence and females then seek a blood meal necessary for developing their eggs. Following 
 Author Summary Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonotic disease that affects domestic livestock and humans. During inter-epizootic periods, the main infection mechanism is suspected to be through bites by infected mosquitoes, mainly of Aedes and Culex genera. In East Africa, RVF outbreaks are known to be closely associated with heavy rainfall events, unlike in the semi-arid regions of West Africa where the drivers of RVF emergence remain poorly understood. This study brings mechanistic insight to explain why reported RVF outbreaks in Northern Senegal cannot be correlated directly to rainfall. This is done through the use of a rainfall-driven model of RVF vector populations that combines a hydrological model to simulate daily water variations of mosquito breeding sites, with mosquito population models capable of reproducing the major trends in population dynamics of the two main vectors of RVF virus in Senegal, Ae. vexans and Cx. poicilipes. Results show that RVF occurs during years when both species are present simultaneously in high densities. Simulations of interannual variations in mosquito populations successfully explained the dates of RVF outbreaks observed between 1961 and 2003. egg development of about three days, females lay eggs on specific humid surfaces (oviposition sites), proceed to a new blood meal, and perform a new gonotrophic cycle, which corresponds to the period between 2 successive egg layings. The bioecology of Ae. vexans and Cx. poicilipes differs. Cx. poicilipes eggs are deposited directly on water surfaces and immediately proceed through development into larvae; they do not survive dessication. In contrast, Ae. vexans females lay their eggs on the soil just above the current water level  [33] . To hatch, the eggs must first dry out for a minimum number of days before being submerged in water. Moreover, in dry Sahelian regions, Cx. poicilipes populations may survive unfavourable conditions of the dry period as adults in dormancy (diapause) whereas Ae. vexans survive as eggs in desiccated mud, that will hatch during the next rainy season  [33] . 
 The mosquito population model In the context of data scarce regions, we developed a simple model that captured the main features of Ae. vexans and Cx. poicilipes dynamics at the scale of a pond. The sole dynamic input was the water surface area of pond P at a daily time step t, written as S P t . Only female mosquitoes are modelled and the two mosquito populations of each pond are assumed independent. We followed the theoretical framework proposed by Porphyre et al.  [41]  for Cx. poicilipes populations, and we extended this model to better take into account specificities of the bioecology of Ae. vexans. The dynamics of the number of adult female mosquitoes of pond P, time step t, M P t , is described by: M P tz1~M P t {a t :M P t zs P (T):x P t (T):E P t{T M P t {a t :M P t if tvT diapause otherwise ( , ð1Þ where a t is the daily mortality rate, T the developmental period, i.e. the elapsed time during which a newly hatching egg undergoes its development until the emergence of an adult, E P t the number of hatching eggs in the pond P, time step t, and T diapause the date when mosquitoes enter into diapause. The production rate of new adults from a pool of hatching eggs is expressed as the product of the mosquito production capacity of the breeding site, s P (T), and of the availability function of the pond P, x P t (T). Production rate. From a pool of hatching eggs at earlier time t-T, a proportion w(T) survives the maturation and transformation stages up to the time of emergence t, with w(T) the pre-imago survival probability depending on the developmental period T and the daily larval survival rate c: w(T)~c T ð2Þ Simultaneously to the maturation and transformation phases, the breeding site (pond P) undergoes changes from a surface S P t{T to S P tjt{T , where S P tjt{T represents the smallest surface during the developmental period that still contains stages susceptible of leading to emergence of adults: S P tjt{T~m in S P t 0 À Á , for t{Tƒt 0 ƒt ð3Þ Thus, at time t, only a fraction S P tjt{T . S P t{T of surviving pupa w(T) have a chance b of giving rise to emergence of adults, out of which a proportion k are females. As a result, the production rate of new mosquitoes from a pool of hatching eggs is given by s P (T):x P t (T)~kb w(T)S P t t{T j . S P t{T ð4Þ With s P (T)~kb w(T) ð5Þ and x P t (T)~S P t t{T j . S P t{T : ð6Þ Culex poicilipes hatching eggs. Considering the very high rate of hatching eggs of Culex mosquitoes  [42] , the number of hatching eggs E P t is calculated as the number of eggs laid by the female mosquitoes at time t on pond P. Let t be the length of the gonotrophic cycle. At each time step t, only a fraction 1=t of the adult female mosquito population oviposits, with l eggs laid per female. The success of oviposition at pond P is derived from the fraction f P t S P t S P max of the pond surface available for mosquito laying, f P t~f (d,S P t ) being a scaling factor to take into account that females only oviposit at a given inner distance d from the pond border. Considering E max the maximum egg density, the number of Cx. poicilipes hatching eggs is calculated as: E P t~m ax( l t f P t S P t S P max M P t ; E max f P t S P t ) ð7Þ Aedes vexans hatching eggs. As for Cx. poicilipes, the number of eggs laid by Ae. vexans female mosquitoes in the humid surface surrounding the pond depends on the number of female mosquitoes M, the number of eggs laid by female l, and the length of the gonotrophic cycle t. But the number of hatching eggs from a pool of eggs laid by Aedes female mosquitoes at time t-k, Eh P t{k , will be null if k is less than the minimum desiccation period T d or if the eggs were submerged in water before achieving the minimum desiccation period. Moreover, the eggs will only hatch at time t if DS P t~S P t {S P t{1 , the pond surface variation between t and t-1, is positive. In that case, the potential hatching surface is S P t {S P t{t 0 , with t' defined such as S P t{k ƒS P t{t 0 for 1ƒkƒt 0 and the dynamics of the Aedes hatching eggs E P t is described by: E P t~0 if DS P t w0 P t 0 k~1 Eh P t{k otherwise 8 > < > : ð8Þ with Eh P t{k , the number of hatching eggs from a pool of eggs laid by Aedes female mosquitoes at time t-k, being derived from the number of eggs laid using a normal distribution to describe the distribution of the eggs around the pond.

Parameters and variables of the model are summarized in  Table 1 . 
 Initial conditions and simulations The hydrologic model and both Cx. poicilipes and Ae. vexans models were run for two ponds in the study area, Niaka and Furdu  (Figure 1b) . The two ponds were considered representative of the water bodies in the area, Niaka (363 525 m 2 ) being a large pond located in the main stream of the Ferlo Valley, and Furdu (9 603 m 2 ) being a smaller pond located outside the main stream  [40] . The initial Cx. poicilipes adult population was defined proportionally to the pond perimeter covered by vegetation, with an initial density of adults of 1 adult.m 21 . The initial number of Ae. vexans eggs was defined proportionally to the pond surface, with an initial density of 1000 eggs.m 22 . Simulations started June 1 st , at the beginning of the rainy season. The date of diapause was October 1 st , according to  [46] . 
 Sensitivity analysis A sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the robustness of the mosquito population model. We used the OAT (one-factor-ata-time) Morris's method  [47] , as revised by  Campolongo (1999) , allowing the estimation of the two-factor interaction  [48, 49] . The input parameters and their ranges based on the literature data were used in the analysis. When information was unavailable, the parameters space variation was defined using nominal values 610% and a uniform distribution. Three outputs have been tested for each species: (1) the cumulated annual abundance, (2) the maximum abundance, and (3) the date of the peak of abundance. 
 Calibration and validation We used field mosquito collection data during two periods,  1991-1996 and 2002-2003 [21,33] , in an area surrounding Barkedji village to 1) calibrate and 2) assess the goodness of fit of the population dynamics models using the coefficient of determination to measure how well the predicted Ae. vexans and Cx. poicilipes abundance values fit with a set of observed mosquito data. The latter were collected at Furdu and Niaka ponds near Barkedji village, every 20 days during the 2002 and 2003 rainy seasons  (Figure 1b, Table 2 )  [34] . The mean number of Culex and Aedes collected per trap over the consecutive nights of a trapping session (between 5 and 9 days) was calculated. The mosquito population model was calibrated for the two species using 2002-2003 Furdu entomological data collection. The parameters identified as most sensitive by the sensitivity analysis were calibrated. The calibration was then performed with a systematic exploration of the input parameters space  (Table 3) . Other parameter values were Between 1991 and 1996, mosquitoes were collected each year monthly between July and November in the Barkedji area with different kinds of traps at different locations  [21]    (Table 2) . We computed the mean number of Cx. poicilipes and Ae. vexans collected per CO 2 light trap and per night over the different locations. We used only one type of trap to avoid any trap related bias in the measure of mosquito abundance. CO 2 light traps collections were used because those traps were used evenly each year. The degree of association between observed and simulated abundances for each mosquito species was assessed by calculating the crosscorrelation coefficient. 
 Simulation of Aedes vexans and Culex poicilipes populations from 1961 to 2003 Once validated, the models were run over a 63-year period, from 1961 to 2003, using rainfall historical records provided by the meteorological station of Linguère. As output, we considered the dynamics of each mosquito species expressed in relative values, as well as the product of the two temporal series. The latter index expresses the synchronicity of the Ae. vexans and Cx. poicilipes populations and higher values are obtained when the two mosquito populations are both abundant at the same time. It is subsequently referred as the Index of Simultaneous Abundance (ISA). Finally, we compared and discussed the outputs of the model with the occurrence dates of RVF outbreaks or seroconversion rates reported in Northern Senegal and Southern Mauritania between 1987 and 2003 (  Figure 1a ) and with the annual prevalence rates recorded between 1989 and 2003 by the FAO sentinel herd system  [50] . 
 Results 
 Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis (SA) allows identifying the key parameters of the population dynamics models for Ae. vexans and Cx. poicilipes species  (Figure 2) . Overall, the SA showed that the development period T and daily larval survival rate c, which are both linked to the larval stage, are the parameters with the most effects on model outputs for the two species. Other parameters identified as influential for Cx. poicilipes were Emax and l, two parameters concerning the oviposition, whereas the other key parameters for Ae. vexans, Q and Td, were related to the desiccation phase. These eight parameters were thus more accurately estimated through the calibration process. 
 Calibration and validation The T, c, Emax, l, Q and Td parameter values were estimated from model calibration for Cx. poicilipes and Ae. vexans species on the Furdu pond (  Table 2 ). The comparison of Cx. poicilipes and Ae. vexans observed abundances in 2002-2003 with outputs of the model showed that the model, driven only by rainfall data, reproduces well the major trends in the intra-and inter-annual population fluctuations  (Figure 3) . With cross-correlation values of 0.78 for Culex, to 0.52 for Aedes, the results of the simulations regarding the dates of the peaks and the proportion of abundance are consistent with entomological field data. When considering Ae. vexans populations, for both years the model reproduces well the first abundance peak of catches occurring at the beginning of the rainy season (July), generally after the first effective rainfall  [33] . Moreover, the model simulates well the dates of maximum abundance at the end of the rainy season for Cx. poicilipes in 2002 and 2003. Finally, the model is able to correctly simulate the relative levels of abundance between the two years for the two species (higher Cx. poicilipes and Ae. vexans densities in 2003 than in 2002)  (Figure 3 ).  The comparison of observed and simulated mosquito abundances from 1991 to 1996 confirmed the capacity of the model to assess the inter-annual variability of Cx. poicilipes populations  (Figure 4 ). For instance, the year of highest abundance of Cx. poicilipes observed during this six years period (1993) was clearly identified by the model. However, it failed to simulate the high abundances of Ae. vexans populations observed in 1991 and 1996  (Figure 4) , suggesting that the model would only detect very high inter-annual variations in Ae. vexans abundances, like between the years 2002 and 2003. The cross-correlation coefficient values were fair (cor = 0.43 for both species). Finally, considering both population dynamics, the model reflects well the temporal interval between Ae. vexans and Cx. poicilipes dynamics, the former appearing at the very first rain, while the latter is stronger at the end of the rainy season, taking over from the declining Ae. vexans population. 
 Simulation of Aedes vexans and Culex poicilipes populations from 1961 to 2003 The modelled dynamics of Ae. vexans and Cx. poicilipes populations depict a high inter-annual variability over the studied period (  Figure 5 ). Simulations put into evidence that the abundance of both species vary greatly between years. Moreover, the model shows that the peak of abundance of Ae. vexans populations generally occurs before the peak of Cx. poicilipes populations, depicting Aedes-before-Culex population cycles. Vari-ations of the ISA reveal the variations in the temporal lag between Ae. vexans and Cx poicilipes populations. The two major RVFV circulation events in northern Senegal and southern Mauritania were recorded in 1987  [25]  and 2003  [28] . For these two years the model predicted high ISA values of Ae. vexans and Cx. poicilipes populations. According to this index, 1989 and 1993 also appear as years of simultaneous abundant mosquito populations (  Figure 5 ). This is in agreement with the results of several sero-surveys conducted in the area. Serosurveys in small ruminants performed after 1988 showed an active transmission of RVFV till 1989  [26] . In October 1993, active RVFV transmission was detected in several locations of southern Mauritania, in association with an increase of abortions in small ruminant populations  [26]    (Figure 1a) . That same year, RVFV was isolated from Ae. vexans and Ae. ochraceus species, and from one sheep in Barkedji village  [27] . Between 1993 and 2003, no epizootic event was observed but virus circulation was detected in 1998 from Cx. poicilipes populations  [29] . 
 Discussion The results of our modelling approach are consistent with those of previous studies  [21, 29, 34, 51] , which argue that the two vector species Ae. vexans and Cx. poicilipes play a major synergistic role in RVFV transmission in Senegal, and that the years of high virus circulation levels coincide with years of high abundances of both mosquito species. In  Figure 5  it can be seen that since 1961, years   of RVF outbreaks do not coincide with years of highest total rainfall. Previous studies have shown that in West Africa, Ae. vexans and Cx. poicilipes abundance and total rainfall were not correlated  [30, 31] . Rainfall variability was suggested to be more important than total rainfall for explaining mosquito populations, as the amount of Ae. vexans and Cx. poicilipes generation depends on the alternation of rainy and dry periods  [33] . Our results come in support of these findings and suggestions, by providing evidence that present knowledge on the hydrology of temporary ponds and on mosquito population dynamics, as formalised in a model, is able to explain a large part of the observed mosquito abundance temporal variability. According to the yearly simulations, exceptionally high Aedes population densities were present in 1987 and 2003 (  Figure 5 ). This result strengthens the hypotheses that RVFV may either be introduced by transhumant herds at the beginning of the rainy season or transmitted vertically in Aedes populations (which would explain the maintenance of the virus during interepizootic periods  [21, 27, 28] ), and would be amplified by Aedes populations, relayed by the Cx. poicilipes species  [33] , when both species are present abundantly at the same time. To a lesser extent, the same pattern can be observed in 1993 (  Figure 5 ). Due to the limited number of animals monitored, the RVF surveillance system showed limited capacities to correctly detect RVFV circulation and may have failed to detect animal cases  [18, 28] . In 1993, RVF outbreaks were reported in Mauritania  [26] , whereas according to the surveillance system based on sentinel herds, only one sheep specimen was found infected in Barkedji in Senegal  [27] . As confirmed by observation data  [21] , the small simulated Ae. vexans population may explain why no clinical cases were reported that year in Barkedji, suggesting again that the Ae. vexans population does play a major role in the amplification of the virus. In 1987, the modelled mosquito abundances were the highest for the 1961-2003 period. In 1989, the Ae. vexans and Cx. poicilipes ISA was also very high, although no outbreak was detected. This can be explained by the probably high immunity rate of the ruminant populations following the 1987 outbreak, when animals may have been infected but remained asymptomatic cases. Moreover, since 1987 no other epizootic event led to an epidemic. Thus, although the simulated inter-annual variations in mosquito populations may explain the dates of RVF outbreaks observed between 1961 and 2003, others factors may drive the transition from an epizootic to an epidemic event. One strong possibility is the date of the Eid al-Kabir celebration, which favour very high ruminant concentrations  [52, 53]  and numerous contacts between humans and potentially viremic animals. Moreover, the cooccurrence in time of the Ae. vexans populations and the arrival of transhumant herds in the study area at the beginning of the rainy season may be crucial for the amplification of RVFV: if there are only few domestic ruminants available at the emergence of Ae. vexans populations, the virus will not spread. Given the huge and dramatic socio-economic impacts of RVF, as well as its increasing global importance, there is an urgent need to develop appropriate mathematical tools for disease forecasting  [18] . Our modelling approach which integrates presently available knowledge on RVF vector biology, is a first step towards the development of a climate-based early-warning system in Senegal which could allow prediction of at-risk periods for RVF, but certainly not the epidemic extent which is driven by human factors  [54, 55] . Our results highlight that rainfall, as main driver of the hydrologic dynamics of the main breeding sites of RVF vectors, is a predictive factor of RVF in the studied area. In this respect, RVF in East and West Africa present very similar transmission processes, with water availability driving mosquito populations of the Aedes and Culex genera which have almost the same breeding sites and trophic behaviour  [21] . More improvement on the model itself can be sought, as different simplifications have been made to develop a simple and robust model in a context of data poor areas. Improvements of the hydrological model have been discussed in  [40] . To model the mosquito population dynamics, we considered water availability as the main constraint driving the population dynamics. Nevertheless, other variables, such as temperature, humidity, and vegeta- Total rainfall per year is represented in blue.

Gray bars indicate prevalence rate in sentinel herd as reported by the RVF surveillance system  [56] . Stars indicate years with reported RVF outbreaks in Northern Senegal and Southern Mauritania: 1) In 1987, the RVF epizootic led to an epidemic among humans exposed to diseased animals, where more than 200 human deaths were recorded together with many abortions in livestock  [25] ; 2) In 1993, an increase of seroprevalence rates in livestock along the Senegal River was recorded  [26] ; 3) In 2003, five RVF outbreaks were reported in the Senegal River valley by the national RVF surveillance network, and high seroconversion rates were reported in small ruminants in Barkedji, Ferlo region  [28, 57] . doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0001795.g005 tion cover, could be taken into account in the mosquito population model. These variables might impact the survival rates of mosquitoes in aquatic and aerial stages, as well as the RVFV development. Moreover, values of the different parameters, such as the date of diapause, could be better estimated from entomological data relative to Ae. vexans and Cx. poicilipes in Senegal. 
 Concluding remarks For the first time, mechanistic insight is provided in this study to explain why reported RVF outbreaks in Northern Senegal cannot be correlated directly to rainfall, as it is the case in East Africa. This is done through the use of a rainfall-driven model of RVF vector populations that combines a hydrological model to simulate daily water variations of mosquito breeding sites, with mosquito population models capable of reproducing the major trends of population dynamics of the two main vectors of RVFV in Senegal, Ae. vexans and Cx. poicilipes. Results show that RVF occurs during years when both species are present simultaneously in high densities. These occur when the rainfall temporal patterns result in water variations in the pond that are favourable for the reproduction of both mosquito species, i.e., abundant rains occurring at regular intervals throughout the rainy season. The combined model can now be used in simulation studies for identifying which rainfall patterns would result in the simultaneous abundance of both species (high ISA), so that operational real-time rainfall-based monitoring systems can be developed.

Today, the area of citrus cultivation is primarily found between the latitudes of 40°N and 40°S, and global citrus production has reached 122 M tonnes  [1] . The production of sweet orange, the leading varietal type, approaches close to 69 M tonnes  [1] . Small citrus fruits (mandarin-like) are preponderant in China and very important in the Mediterranean Basin where Clementine is the main cultivar. Despite controversial Citrus classifications, most authors now agree on the origin of cultivated citrus species. Scora  [2]  and Barrett and Rhodes  [3]  were the first to suggest that three primary Citrus species (C. medica L.citrons, C. reticulata Blancomandarins, and C. maxima L. Osbeckpummelos) were the ancestors of most cultivated citrus. The differentiation between these sexually compatible taxa can be explained via the foundation effect in three geographic zones and by an initial allopatric evolution  [2, 4] . Other cultivated species (referred to hereafter as secondary species) such as C. aurantium L. (sour orange), C. sinensis (L.) Osb. (sweet orange), C. paradisi Macf. (grapefruit), C. clementina hort. Ex Tan. (Clementine) and C. limon Osb. (lemon) originated later through hybridization and a limited number of sexual recombination events among the basic taxa. Molecular marker studies  [5] [6] [7] [8]  generally support the role of these three taxa as ancestors of cultivated Citrus. Furthermore, some of these studies  [8] [9] [10]  highlighted the probable contribution of a fourth taxon, C. micrantha Wester, as the ancestor of some limes [C. aurantifolia (Christm.) Swingle]. In general, Citrus species are diploid with a basic chromosome number x = 9  [11] . Citrus species have small genomes. While estimating citrus genome size by flow cytometry, Ollitrault et al.  [12]  found significant genome size variation between citrus species. The largest and smallest genomes were C. medica (average value of 398 Mb/haploid genome) and C. reticulata (average value of 360 Mb/haploid genome), respectively. C. maxima had an intermediate genome size, with an average value of 383 Mb/haploid genome. Interestingly, the secondary species presented intermediate values between their putative ancestral parental taxa, C. sinensis (370 Mb), C. aurantium (368 Mb), C. paradisi, (381 Mb) and C. limon (380 Mb) per haploid genome. As mentioned previously, most modern cultivars have an interspecific origin and their genomes can be considered mosaics of large DNA fragments inherited from the basic taxa  [7] . These cultivars are generally highly heterozygous  [6, 7] . The C. maxima and C. reticulata gene pools contributed to the genesis of most of the economically important species and cultivars including sweet and sour oranges, grapefruits, tangors (mandarin × sweet orange hybrids), tangelos (mandarin × grapefruit hybrids) and lemons  [6, 7, 9] .  Barkley et al. and  Garcia-Lor et al.  [10, 11]  estimated the relative contributions of primary species to modern cultivars. Some discrepancies have been observed between these studies, and the detailed interspecific genome organization of cultivated secondary species and modern cultivars is still largely unknown. As a foundational step towards deciphering the phylogenetic structures of citrus genomes and the molecular bases of phenotypic variation, a reference whole genome sequence of a haploid derived from Clementine was produced and is currently being revised by the International Citrus Genome Consortium (ICGC)  [13, 14] . The Clementine mandarin is an interspecific hybrid that was selected one century ago in Algeria by Father Clement as a chance offspring among seedlings of the 'Mediterranean' mandarin (C. reticulata)  [15] . Since that time, the Clementine has been vegetatively propagated by grafting. In a recent large SNP diversity survey, Ollitrault et al.  [8]  confirmed that the Clementine is a 'Mediterranean' mandarin × sweet orange hybrid (tangor). This conclusion is in agreement with the hypothesis of Deng et al. and Nicolosi et al.  [9, 16]  The supposed parental relationships between Clementine, sweet orange, pummelo and mandarin are summarized in  Figure 1 . The Clementine genome size is estimated to be 367 Mb/haploid genome  [12] . The ICGC identified the construction of a saturated genetic map of Clementine as an essential prerequisite to improve the sequence assembly of the haploid Clementine reference genome. Compared with other crops, genetic mapping in citrus is relatively less well developed. The partial genetic maps built with codominant markers C. reticulata (primarily SSRs)  [17] [18] [19]  encompass around 150 markers, while maps based on dominant markers such as AFLPs,  [20]  SRAPs, ISSRs, and RAPDs  [21]  include slightly more than 200 markers. Moreover, few of the mapped markers have been published in GenBank (or other public nucleotide databases). Within the last 15 years, the citrus community developed Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers with reference sequences that were deposited in public databases. While a limited number of SSR markers were obtained from genomic libraries  [6, [22] [23] [24] , the implementation of large EST databases allowed the development of many more SSR markers  [25, 26] , and additional markers have been developed from Clementine BACs end sequencing (BES;  [27] [28] [29] ). From the same Clementine BES database, Ollitrault et al.  [30]  developed 33 Indel markers to contribute to Clementine genetic mapping. Despite these international efforts, the number of available heterozygous SSRs and Indels in Clementine was still insufficient to establish a saturated Clementine genetic map. SNP markers are well adapted for high throughput methods for marker saturation. Ollitrault et al.  [8]  took advantage of the Clementine BES database  [27]  to identify SNPs heterozygous in Clementine, and a GoldenGate SNPs array was developed. Interestingly, 63% of the validated SNP markers were heterozygous in the sweet orange. Therefore, these SNPs can be used for comparative mapping between the Clementine and sweet orange. The primary goals of the present study were: (i) to establish a saturated reference map of Clementine using codominant markers with sequences available in public databases; (ii) to perform comparative mapping between sweet orange, pummelo and Clementine; and (iii) to localize the crossover events that produced the sweet orange gamete that contributed to the Clementine genome, and those involved in the gamete formation that gave rise to the haploid Clementine  [13]  used for the citrus reference whole genome sequence  [14] . The clementine reference map and the pummelo map were established from two interspecific hybrid populations ('Chandler' pummelo × 'Nules' Clementine -CP × NC (156 hybrids) and 'Nules' Clementine × 'Pink' pummelo -NC × PP, (140 hybrids)) with 1166 codominant markers. The sweet orange map anchored with the Clementine map was established by genotyping 582 segregating SNP markers from 147 progeny from crosses between sweet orange and trifoliate orange (SO × TO). This study also yielded information regarding the magnitude and distribution of segregation distortion within the different crosses. 
 Results 
 Polymorphism and allele calls for the SNP markers For all SNPs, genotyping was visually confirmed, taking advantage of the distribution of the segregating progenies relative to the parental positions. This observation was conducted individually for each plate of 96 genotypes. Plate/marker combinations with unclear clustering of genotypes were removed from the analysis. No differences were found between the different sweet orange parents or between the trifoliate orange parents of the SO × TO progenies. Therefore, all individuals resulting from the different crosses were considered as single family. For the selected data, the markers were assigned to different categories based on the observed segregations, the detection of null alleles and, finally, the type of segregation assumed according to the JoinMap nomenclature  (Tables 1 and 2 ). The observed segregation within a progeny permitted identification of the null alleles in terms of homozygosity (00) or heterozygosity (A0) in the parents (  Figure 2 ). These two configurations of null alleles were found for 0 and 31 markers in the Clementine, 69 and 19 in Chandler, 78 and 17 in Pink, 0 and 72 in sweet orange, and 128 and 0 in trifoliate orange, respectively  (Table 2  and Additional file 1). Markers with A0 × BB and A0 × 00 configurations were treated as < lm × ll > and the reciprocal configurations were treated as < nn × np >. Markers with the AB × A0 configuration were analyzed as < lm × ll > by considering (i) BA and B0 hybrids as < lm > genotypes, (ii) the undistinguishable AA and A0 as < ll >; thus, considering only the segregation of the AB parent. Reciprocal configurations were treated as < nn × np >. Considering all markers (with and without null alleles), the first category consisted of markers heterozygous in one parent and homozygous in the other (classified as < nn × np > or < lm × ll > in JoinMap). These markers represented the majority of the useful markers (with 606 < nn × np > and 6 < lm × ll > in CP × NC, 8 < nn × np > and 644 < lm × ll > in NC × PP and 1 < nn × np > and 572 < lm × ll > in SO × TO). These markers were only mapped for the heterozygous parents. As SNP markers are diallelic, the only other conformation encountered was < hk × hk >, where the two parents displayed the same heterozygosity. These markers were not frequent, and 29, 24 and 9 markers with such a configuration were observed for CP × NC, NC × PP and SO × TO, respectively. Considering our strategy to develop independent maps for each parent, the lack of information when assigning the parental allele for each hybrid (only possible for the homozygous hybrid and, thus, only half of the population) and the relatively low number of markers with this < hk × hk > conformation, these markers were removed from the mapping analysis. 
 SSR and Indel genotyping The genotyping of the CP × NC population was performed in the framework of the ICGC. SSR analysis was performed by six international groups (University of California at Riverside; University of Florida; University of Cukurova-Turkey; IVIA-Spain; INRA-France and CIRAD-France, with the collaboration of INRAM-Morocco). The genotyping of the NC × PP was performed at CIRAD and IVIA. Homozygous or heterozygous null alleles in the parents were assumed from the observed SSR segregations. These two configurations of null alleles were found in 2 and 10 markers in Clementine, 9 and 4 in 'Chandler' and 10 and 5 in 'Pink' , respectively (  Table 2  and Additional file 1). Loci containing null alleles were treated as previously described for SNP markers. With multiallelic SSRs, six allelic configurations were possible. AA × AB or CC × AB were treated equally as < nn × np > by JoinMap, and the two reciprocal configurations were assumed to be < lm × ll >. Fully heterozygous configurations with four alleles (AB × CD) or three alleles (AB×BC) were coded < ab × cd > and < ef × eg >, respectively. Among the SSRs successfully genotyped, the five JoinMap configurations (nn × np, lm × ll, hk × hk, ef × eg, and ab × cd) were encountered for 130, 34, 1, 43 and 70 markers in CP × NC and 24, 79, 3, 19 and 26 markers in NC × PP progenies, respectively. As for SNPs, the very few markers with the hk × hk configuration were removed from the analysis. The nn × np and lm × ll markers were mapped for the male or female parents, respectively. The fully heterozygous markers (< ef × eg > and < ab × cd >) were mapped for the two parents and, therefore, allowed anchoring of the male and female parent maps. Only four Indel markers displayed homozygous null alleles in 'Chandler' pummelo  (Table 2  and Additional file 1). No heterozygous null alleles were indicated in 'Nules' Clementine, 'Chandler' or 'Pink' pummelos. For Indels, the five JoinMap configurations (nn × np, lm × ll, hk × hk, ef × eg, and ab × cd) were encountered for 20, 2,  these matrices were analyzed using JoinMap 4. The linkage group numbering was performed according to the sweet orange genetic map established by the US citrus genome working group (Mikeal Roose; personal communication). The main results of the individual mapping analyses are given in  Table 3 , and detailed results are presented in Additional file 2. 'Nules' Clementine genetic map The reference Clementine genetic map was obtained in two steps. In the first step, male and female Clementine data were analyzed separately. Male Clementine map: Among the 872 segregating markers, 869 (606 SNPs, 240 SSRs and 23 Indels) were distributed into nine linkage groups (LGs) while three markers remained ungrouped. Most of the LG conserved their integrity until LOD=10. Only LG8 was disrupted in three sub-groups at LOD 9.The three sub-groups corresponded to three regions of LG8 separated by relatively wide intervals without intermediate markers. When mapped individually they displayed conserved order and very similar distances compared with the entire LG8. The map spanned 1164.26 cM. The Clementine male gametes exhibited 57% of the markers deviating from the expected Mendelian ratio (with a 0.05 probability threshold). Skewed markers were grouped within several parts of the genome. The skewed markers were unequally spread throughout the linkage groups with relatively low frequencies in LG2 (3.6%) and LG8 (13.5%), but with very high frequencies in LG4 (71.6%), LG5 (83.1%), LG7 (74.5%) and LG9 (85.6%). This distribution of segregation distortions is detailed below in comparison with the other parents. Female Clementine map: Among the 788 markers successfully genotyped, 783 (642 SNPs, 122 SSRs and 21 Indels) were grouped in nine LGs, while five remained ungrouped. Most of the LG conserved their integrity until LOD=10. Only LG8 was disrupted in two sub-groups at LOD=8 corresponding to two regions of le LG8 separated by a relatively wide interval without marker. When mapped individually the sub-groups displayed conserved order and very similar distances compared with the entire LG8.The map size was 923.5 cM. The frequency of skewed markers (13.0%) was much lower than that observed among male gametes. Skewed markers were mainly concentrated in LG5 (33.3%) and LG9 (24.1%). Despite the high frequency of skewed markers in the male Clementine map, the colinearity between the male and female maps was highly conserved (Additional file 3). Therefore, the reference Clementine map was established by joining the two data sets for each LG, including all markers present in at least one map. Nine hundred and sixty-one markers (677 SNPs, 258 SSRs and 26 Indels) were grouped into nine linkage groups totaling 1084.07 cM (  Figure 3  and Additional files 2 and 4). The proportion of skewed markers remained high (46.1% for p < 0.05). The LG size ranged from 87.5 cM (LG9) to 186.3 cM (LG3). LG7 and LG8 possessed a relatively low density of markers with an average of 0.45 and 0.52 markers/cM, respectively. On average, nearly one marker/cM was found on the other LGs. Each LG exhibited a heterogeneous density of markers (  Figure 4 ). A few gaps larger than 10 cM were observed without mapped markers, and more gaps between 5 cM and 10 cM were observed without markers (  Figure 3 ). These gaps were distributed, respectively, as  Table 3  Main parameters of the six genetic maps inferred from three segregating progenies  N  LG 1 LG 2 LG3 LG 4 LG 5  LG8  (3, 4)  and LG9 (0, 6). On M D Size M D Size M D Size M D Size M D Size LG9, a special feature was observed, in which 55 markers were mapped within a 5-cM interval. 'Chandler' pummelo genetic map Among the 158 segregating markers, 151 (141 SSRs, 5 SNPs and 5 Indels) were successfully mapped in nine linkage groups (Additional files 2 and 5). One hundred and nine of these markers were common with the Clementine map. The level of segregation distortion was low (13.2%) and was mainly observed on two LGs (LG2: 34.6% and LG8: 37.5%). The total size of the map was 828.6 cM. 'Pink' pummelo map Only 84 segregating markers were available for Pink pummelo mapping. Eighty-one (67 SSRs, 7 SNPs and 7 Indels) were mapped in nine linkage groups (Additional files 2 and 6). Fifty-two of these markers were shared with the Clementine map. The level of segregation distortion was similar to the Chandler pummelo map (15.9%), but affected other LGs, mainly LG6 (42.9%) and LG9 (50%). The map spanned 633.9 cM. 
 Sweet orange map The sweet orange map was only based on SNP markers. Among the 572 segregating markers, 569 were mapped in nine linkage groups, with a total size of 669.6 cM (Additional files 2 and 7). Most of the LG conserved their integrity until LOD=10. However three LG (2, 3 and 5) were disrupted in two sub-groups at LOD 9, 6 and 10 respectively. As for male and female clementine these disruptions corresponded to relatively wide interval without intermediate markers. the sub-groups displayed conserved order and very similar distances compared with their relative entire LGs. Four hundred and eighteen of these markers were in common with the reference Clementine genetic map. Segregation distortion was relatively frequent (26.9%) and was particularly clustered in LG5 (50%) and LG9 (72.9%). 
 Genetic map comparisons Analysis of colinearity between the different genetic maps Synteny, considered as the collocation of marker in the same chromosome, was completely conserved between all of the parental genetic maps. The linear order of the common markers was also highly conserved between LG1 LG2 LG3 LG4 LG5 LG6 LG7 LG8 LG9  parents (  Figure 5 ), with only a few cases of inverted order in small intervals. However, the genetic distance between markers appeared to be unequal between parents. Sweet orange in particular displayed smaller distances between shared markers than Clementine. To avoid bias due to the different number of loci analyzed, new genetic maps of sweet orange and Clementine (male, female and consensus) were constructed using only the data generated from the 418 SNP markers that were successfully genotyped in the NC × PP, CP × NC and SO × TO progenies. The results (Additional file 8) confirmed that the genetic distances were generally lower (except for LG4 and LG9) in the sweet orange map than in the Clementine reference map. Moreover, differences were confirmed between the male and female Clementine maps for LG3, LG4, LG7, LG8 and LG9, with systematically lower distances in the female map. Interestingly, markers with very strong linkage localized in the very high marker density area of LG9 for the Clementine and sweet orange maps were much farther apart in 'Chandler' and 'Pink' pummelos (  Figure 5 ). Location of crossover events in the sweet orange gamete at the origin of Clementine and in the Clementine gamete at the origin of the haploid Clementine used for the reference citrus whole genome sequence For each linkage group, the haplotypes of sweet orange and Clementine were inferred from SNP marker phases given by JoinMap. The origin of Clementine from a 'Mediterranean mandarin' × sweet orange hybridization was proven by Ollitrault et al.  [8] . Homozygous markers in sweet oranges and Mediterranean mandarin were used to identify the haplotype of Clementine inherited from sweet orange. Comparison of this haplotype with the two sweet orange haplotypes allowed the identification of nine recombination break points, one each in LG1, LG7 and LG9, and two each in LG3, LG4 and LG5  (Figure 6a ). The two Clementine haplotypes were compared with the genotyping data of the haploid Clementine used by the ICGC to establish the reference citrus WGS haploid sequence. This permitted the identification of eight recombination break points, one each in LG1, LG7 and LG8, two in LG 5 and three in LG3 (  Figure 6b ). Interestingly, LG2, LG4, LG6 and LG1 LG2 LG3 LG4 LG5 LG6 LG7 LG8 LG9 LG9 appeared to have been entirely inherited from 'Mediterranean' mandarin without recombination. 
 Comparative distribution of segregation distortions To compare the location of the genome areas affected by segregation distortions in the different parental maps, a rough location in the reference Clementine maps was estimated for markers (i) mapped in sweet orange but not in Clementine, (ii) mapped in 'Chandler' pummelo but not in Clementine or sweet orange and, finally (iii) for markers only mapped in 'Pink' pummelo. These location estimates were performed by applying tendency curve equations of the location in the reference Clementine map (y axis) according to the location (x axis) for the parent map, where additional markers were mapped. An example of such a location is presented in Additional file 9b. The estimated locations of all markers in the framework of the Clementine reference map are given in the ""synthesis"" column of Additional file 2. The values of the X 2 conformity test of the observed segregation against the 1:1 Mendelian hypothesis are represented along the linkage groups for all of the parental maps in Additional file 9a. Skewed markers appeared to be concentrated in specific areas for the different parents. However sporadic occurrences of a non-distorted marker within a cluster of distorted markers (CiC5563-02), or vice versa (e.g., marker CID5573) are observed in the Clementine reference map. Such exceptions can be explained by the inclusion of these markers with missing data, of probable non random origin, affecting the real segregation ratio. The patterns of segregation distortion are consistent with the local selection of gametes that differ in terms of the probability of contributing to the next generation. Male Clementine presents the higher proportion of skewed loci. In LG1 and at the initial part of LG5, these distortions seem to be shared with female Clementine and sweet orange, although at a lower intensity than in male Clementine. Shared areas of skewed loci were also observed for male Clementine and sweet orange at the end of LG5 and in the middle of LG9, where high marker density was observed. In these two regions, the magnitude of sweet orange distortions was higher than in the male Clementine. The very severe level of segregation distortion observed in the middle of LG3 for male Clementine is shared at a much lower level with sweet orange. The skewed loci of male Pink pummelo in LG6 and LG9 were observed in areas common with male Clementine. Distortions that were observed in Chandler in the initial part of LG2 were not observed in the other parents. The identification of the Clementine haplotypes inherited from 'Mediterranean mandarin' and sweet orange allowed determining at each locus which allele was inherited from both parents of Clementine. Therefore, it was possible to determine which parental alleles (mandarin versus sweet orange) were favored for the skewed areas of the male and female Clementine segregations  (Figure 7) . No systematic tendency was observed. For male Clementine, the skewed segregations were globally in favor of sweet orange alleles for LG1, LG5 and LG7, while the skewed segregations favored mandarin alleles in LG3, LG8 and LG9. Interestingly, in LG6 and more markedly in LG4, a transition from positive selection for sweet orange alleles to positive selection for mandarin alleles was observed when moving from one end of the LG to the other. For LG1, LG2 and LG9, similar patterns of allele segregation were observed in female and male gametes (but generally with a lower distortion magnitude in the female). In LG4 and LG5, the patterns between male and female Clementine were very different, with significant distortion in opposite directions. In the second part of LG4, the mandarin alleles were favored in male Clementine, while sweet orange alleles were significantly favored in female Clementine. In the first part of LG5, mandarin and sweet orange allele were favored respectively in the female and male Clementine. 
 Discussion 
 A first reference genetic map for Citrus The reviews of citrus genetic mapping performed by Ruiz and Asins  [31] , Chen et al.  [19]  and Roose  [32]  underlined that most of the earlier citrus genetic maps were based on intergeneric hybrids between Citrus and Poncirus. This was due to the importance of Poncirus trifoliata for rootstock breeding. Most of these studies suffered from relatively low numbers of analyzed hybrids and from the dominant nature of the markers (RAPD, AFLP) without sequence data on the mapped fragments. Several of the more recent maps were generated using co-dominant markers, particularly SSRs  [17] [18] [19] . However, the number of mapped markers was insufficient to establish the nine linkage groups corresponding to the nine chromosomes present in haploid citrus. Some recent studies also focused on the genetic mapping of Citrus varieties  [17, 20, 21, 33] . The map of Gulsen et al.  [21]  was the first C. clementina map, while Bernet et al.  [17]  mapped Chandler pummelo and Fortune mandarin, a C. clementina × C. tangerina hybrid. None of these maps encompassed enough markers with published sequences to establish a reference citrus map useful to be combined with whole genome sequence data. The current reference Clementine map, established from Clementine male and female segregation, includes 961 co-dominant markers (677 SNPs, 258 SSRs and 26 Indels) spread among nine LG. The map spans 1084.1 cM, with an average marker spacing of 1.13 cM. This is a substantially higher marker density than reported in previous citrus maps, in which nine LG were obtained. Omura et al.  [34]  established a genetic map spanning 801 cM with 120 CAPS markers. Sankar and Moore  [35]  published an 874 cM map including 310 markers (mostly ISSR and RAPD). Carlos de Oliveira et al.  [20] ) established an 845 cM map with 227 AFLP markers and more recently using 215 markers (mostly SRAP) Gulsen et al.  [21]  produced a 858 cM map. The marker density in the current reference Clementine map varied along the genome. The density was particularly low in some regions of LG7 and LG8, with three gaps over 10 cM between markers in each of these LGs. The SNP markers are the most numerous markers on the Clementine map and were randomly selected. Therefore, these low marker density areas probably reveal highly homozygous regions of the Clementine genome. WGS data for the diploid Clementine will be very useful for developing targeted markers within these ""no marker"" regions. At the opposite extreme, high density areas were observed in some LGs. As described by Lindner et al.  [36]  and Van Os et al.  [37] , some of these high marker density regions may be associated with centromeric locations with large physical distances, possibly corresponding to low genetic distances. Another hypothesis is that some areas with high marker density correspond to portions of the genome in interspecific heterozygosity. Indeed, Clementine is considered to be a hybrid between Mediterranean mandarin and sweet orange  [8, 9, 16] . As sweet orange is thought to have originated as a result of interspecific hybridization between C. maxima and C. reticulata gene pools  [6, 7, 9] , some parts of the Clementine genome may represent interspecific heterozygosity (C. maxima/C. reticulata). Garcia-Lor et al.  [38]  showed that the SNP/kb frequency was approximately six times higher between C. reticulata and C. maxima that it was within C. reticulata. Thus, randomly selected LG1 LG2 LG3 LG4 LG5 LG6 LG7 LG8 LG9 P=5% P=5% P=5% P=5%  Figure 7  Distribution of the segregation distortions for female and male Clementine, along the reference Clementine genetic map. The x axis represents the location on each linkage group (LG) and y axis represents the excess of the mandarin allele relatively to Mendelian segregation (y = frequency of mandarin allele minus 0.5). Blue represents male Clementine segregation; red represents female Clementine segregation. The discontinuous lines represent the threshold for significant distortion (p < 0.05). markers should be six times more frequent (by physical distance unit) in those parts of the Clementine genome involved in interspecific heterozygosity. Despite the heterogeneity of marker dispersion, the distance to the nearest mapped marker is less than 5 cM in most locations of the Clementine genome. Moreover previous published diversity studies done with the mapped SSRs (5, 23-26, 28), InDels  (30)  and SNPs (8) gave accurate information of their transferability and polymorphisms, at individual locus level, within and between the principal varietal groups. Therefore, this marker framework will be very useful for marker-trait association studies based on linkage disequilibrium, such as QTL analysis, bulk segregant analysis, or even genetic association studies in the mandarin group, where strong diversity was observed for the mapped SNP markers  [8] . This map is being used to facilitate the chromosome assembly of the reference whole genome citrus sequence based on a haploid Clementine genotype  [13, 39] . Linear marker order is highly conserved between species, but genetic distances are variable between sexes and species The citrus genetic maps based on dominant and mainly cross-specific markers (such as RAPD, AFLP and ISSR) do not permit genetic map comparisons. Multi-allelic codominant markers, such as SSRs, are more powerful for such applications  [30] . Chen et al.  [19]  and Bernet et al.  [17]  successfully used SSRs for citrus map comparison at the interspecific and intergeneric levels. In the present study, the main genotyping effort concerned SNPs. Eight hundred and thirty-six SNP markers were genotyped in the three populations. Most of these markers were mined from Nules Clementine BAC end sequences  [8, 27]  and, as a result, were heterozygous for Clementine. The development of the GoldenGate SNP markers from the Clementine sequence without information on the interspecific variability in flanking areas resulted in numerous homozygous null alleles in pummelo as described by Ollitrault et al.  [8]  and in trifoliate orange. Heterozygous null alleles for 72 markers were found in sweet orange, expanding the number of markers mapped in this species. The selected SNP markers were not efficient for pummelo or trifoliate orange mapping due to the very low number of heterozygous loci in these species. Moreover, the biallelic nature of SNP markers limited the establishment of two anchored maps (male and female) from a single cross. Therefore, comparison between Clementine and pummelo was still primarily limited to common multiallelic SSRs (109 between Clementine and Chandler pummelo and 52 between Clementine and Pink Pummelo). With sweet orange and Clementine maps being developed from different populations, the 418 common heterozygous SNPs allowed more substantial anchorage of the two maps. The conservation of synteny was complete between the species, with no discrepancy in marker localization on the different linkage groups between the maps. Furthermore, the linear order of markers also appeared to be highly conserved between C. clementina, C. sinensis and C. maxima. This is in agreement with the conclusions of Bernet et al.  [17]  following their comparative study of partial maps between three species (C. aurantium, C. maxima and P. trifoliata) and Fortune mandarin, a Clementine-derived mandarin hybrid. In the present study, small localized inversions of marker orders were observed between maps, particularly in dense markers areas. Bernet et al.  [17]  concluded that similar results, for local ordering changes in the integrated maps, resulted from the inclusion of markers with missing data, and eventually different levels of distorted segregations between populations. It is also possible that small genotyping errors concerning the markers located in these dense regions disturbs the mapping order  [40, 41] . The fine mapping of such regions will require larger populations than the ones genotyped in this study. For this reason, these local inversions are not detailed in the results of this study since artifactual origins were quite probable. Chen et al.  [19]  also concluded that colinearity at the intergeneric level was highly conserved between genetic maps of C. sinensis and P. trifoliata. However, they also observed some inversions between shared loci that might reveal chromosomal rearrangement events, such as translocations or inversions. Considering the data of this study and the two previous comparative mapping studies, marker colinearity appears highly conserved at the intrageneric level (Clementine, mandarin, pummelo, sweet orange and sour orange), but also between Citrus and Poncirus. This global conservation of citrus genome organization will allow reasonable inferences of most citrus genome sequences via mapping NGS re-sequencing data to the haploid Clementine reference genome sequence. Variations in LG sizes were observed between the current male Clementine and female Clementine maps. These variations were confirmed when the new maps were exclusively built using the markers shared between the three populations used for the implementation of the Clementine and sweet orange maps. Several LGs were longer in the male Clementine map than in the female one. This was observed in LGs with significant and extensive segregation distortions in the male haplotype populations compared with the female populations, and this was also observed in LG2, where very similar patterns of low skewed loci were observed. From simulated data, Hackett and Broadfoot  [41]  found that segregation distortion (due to gametic selection) alone had very little effect on marker order or map length. As discussed below, the observed distortion in Clementine probably results from gametic rather than zygotic selection. Therefore, it is probable that the longer LGs observed within the male Clementine map do not result from biased estimations due to segregation distortion, but instead reflect differential recombination rates. Such heterochiasmy between sexes is frequent in plants and animals  [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . According to species, recombination should be higher in male or in female gametes  [43] . Despite the fact that heterochiasmy was documented early in the last century  [44] , there is still no consensus as to which of the several proposed hypotheses may explain its occurrence  [45] . The various models were reviewed by Lenormand and Duteil  [46] . Based on a large survey in animals and plants, these authors concluded that sexual heterochiasmy is not influenced by the presence of heteromorphic sex chromosomes; rather, it should result from a male-female difference in gametic selection. However, in this study, the citrus observations do not fit their global model considering as Trivers  [47] , that higher gametic selection in one sex reduced recombination in that sex to preserve the favorable gene combinations that confer reproductive success. Indeed, we found (see discussion on segregation distortion below) much more significant segregation distortion, and therefore probable gametic selection, for Clementine male gametes than for female gametes. The citrus data is more in agreement with models that suggest that the sex experiencing the more intense selection, or otherwise having the higher variance in reproductive success, should show more recombination (as reported by Burt et al.  [47] ). Important differences in LG lengths were also observed between Clementine (male and female) and sweet orange for LG1, LG2, LG3, LG5, LG6 and LG8. The LGs for sweet orange were systematically shorter. The literature on plants and animals shows that the impact of structural heterozygosity on recombination frequency is variable. Different situations have been discussed by Parker et al.  [48] . It is well established that sequence divergence at the interspecific level has an inhibitory effect on sexual recombination  [49] [50] [51] [52] . Chetelat et al.  [52]  observed a strong reduction in the recombination rate in a mapping population of an interspecific F1 tomato hybrid of Lycopersicon esculentum × Solanum lycopersicoides. The authors concluded that the high DNA sequence divergence between L. esculentum and S. lycopersicoides is a better explanation of reduced recombination than structural reorganization. Previously (and also in tomato), Liharska et al.  [53]  showed that the amount of recombination in a defined genetic interval decreased as the proportion of foreign chromatin (introgressed from close relatives of L. esculentum) increased. The authors also mentioned that, as the donor of the foreign chromatin became more distantly related, the level of observed recombination was lower. As the Clementine is a mandarin × sweet orange hybrid, and sweet orange arose from mandarin and pummelo gene pools (with a higher proportion of C. reticulata;  [7, 9] ), it is highly probable that sweet orange contains more genome regions of interspecific heterozygosity (C. reticulata/C. maxima) than the Clementine. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that the lower LG sizes, and the associated lower recombination rates observed in sweet orange compared with Clementine, are associated with the relative interspecific patterns along the genome of these two species. The area of LG9 that displays substantially greater marker density in Clementine and sweet-orange suggests limited recombination within a large genome portion. Thus, two set of markers were common between the Clementine map and the two pummelo maps (MEST308, CIBE6092 and MEST065 for Pink pummelo and mCrCIR07F11, JI-AAG03, MEST 308 and CIBE6092 for Chandler pummelo). Interestingly, in the pummelo maps, these markers cover 26.5 cM and 30 cM, respectively, compared with an area concentrated within 2 cM in the Clementine map. It appears that both Clementine and sweet orange are strongly affected by a similar recombination limitation in LG9 for which they display equivalent map sizes. Haplotype analysis of sweet orange and diploid Clementine shows that the Clementine haplotype transmitted by sweet orange was inherited primarily from one of the sweet orange haplotypes, and only a small telomeric fragment was likely to be transmitted from the other sweet orange haplotype. Further genome analysis along with cytogenetic and mapping studies will be necessary to explain the different recombination patterns observed between species. Extensive segregation distortions are observed in specific linkage group areas particularly when Clementine is used as the male parent Distortions from expected Mendelian allelic segregations were observed for all mapped parents of the segregating progenies. The highest rate was recorded for male Clementine with 56% skewed loci (p < 0.05). This percentage is more than four times higher than that of female Clementine (13%), which was equal with the estimate of female 'Chandler' pummelo. Male 'Pink' pummelo displayed a slightly higher level of distortion than female 'Chandler' pummelo (16%), while sweet orange (mainly from female data) displayed an intermediate level (27%). Distorted loci were also observed in most of the previous citrus mapping studies  [17, 20, [54] [55] [56] [57] . Bernet et al.  [18]  also reported a higher percentage of skewed loci in the male parents compared to the female parents in a reciprocal cross between 'Chandler' pummelo and 'Fortune' mandarin. Since most segregation distortions affect the allele frequencies without disturbing the genotypic frequency equilibrium (non significant F value-Wright fixation index; data not shown), it is probable that gametic selection was the main factor causing skewed segregation. Bernet et al.  [17]  reached the same conclusion from supporting biological data on parental fertility. Upon cross pollination with compatible parents, the proportion of fertilized ovules is much greater than the proportion of successful male gametes. Therefore, it appears logical that gametic selection is likely to be much more pronounced in male gametes than in females ones. This can result from several mechanisms such as gamete abortion, pollen competition or, the citrus gametophytic incompatibility system  [58] . The pattern of X 2 conformity test values, as well as the excess of mandarin alleles along the linkage groups, suggests that the presence of a small number of loci under relatively strong selection pressure on each chromosome is more likely than selection at multiple loci. Similar patterns were observed in tomato  [52] . Identical areas of skewed loci were observed between Clementine and sweet orange in several linkage groups (LG1, LG3, LG5 and LG9). Modern sweet orange varieties arose from an interspecific hybrid prototype that has undergone vegetative propagation or propagation from seeds containing nucellar embryos over a several thousand year period. Besides favorable mutations and stable epigenetic variations that have been selected by man and the environment, it is probable that without the filter of sexual reproduction, the sweet orange genome accumulated unfavorable mutations in a heterozygous status. Some of these unfavorable mutations were likely transmitted to Clementine, as attested by the high proportion of weak progeny obtained from Clementine × sweet orange hybridization (our unpublished data), which should affect both sweet orange and Clementine segregations. Interestingly, the gametic selections have the same orientation for male and female Clementine in the genomic regions where sweet orange segregations are also skewed (LG1, end of LG5, and LG9). In other genome regions, male and female Clementine segregation distortions appeared disconnected. A very strong selection is observed in the middle of LG3 for the male Clementine, without significant skewing in the female. The male and female distortions appeared totally opposite at the end of LG4 and in the first part of LG5. The gametophytic incompatibility system described in citrus  [58]  could be a factor for male gametic selection. However, this may lead to a complete exclusion of one allele for the concerned locus and therefore, a very high distortion for the linked marker locus. This pattern was not observed in the present study. The gametophytic incompatibility system was also excluded as an explanation for the segregation distortion observed in the reciprocal crosses between 'Fortune' mandarin and 'Chandler' pummelo  [17] . Some of the more extremely unequal allelic ratios (70/30) for the male Clementine occurred in areas without significant distortion (or even opposite selection) in the female. Such differences between male and female selection may partly explain the inconsistent results observed for trait segregation in the reciprocal crosses. Thus, it is difficult to infer genetic control from observed trait segregations without concomitant marker segregation analysis. This is particularly true if major genes controlling the studied trait are heterozygous in the male parent. QTL analysis may also be affected as described by Xu  [59] . Haplotype structure of the diploid Clementine and the haploid Clementine used for the implementation of the citrus whole genome reference sequence Clementine is thought to have been selected as a chance seedling from a 'Mediterranean' mandarin by Father Clement just over one century ago in Algeria. The mandarin female parentage was confirmed by mitochondrial genome analysis  [10] . The 'Granito' sour orange was initially considered to be the male parent  [15] . However, molecular studies demonstrated that the Clementine was more likely a mandarin × sweet orange hybrid  [8, 9, 16] . The marker phase analysis performed from the Clementine and sweet orange mapping data confirmed this hypothesis, and allowed the identification of the haplotype structures of the mandarin and sweet orange gametes that produced the Clementine. Nine recombination break points between the two sweet orange haplotypes (one each in LG1, LG7 and LG9, and two each in LG3, LG4 and LG5) were identified for the sweet orange gamete that produced the Clementine. The implementation of a reference citrus whole genome sequence has been the primary focus of the ICGC for the last 5 years. Polymorphism in a whole genome sequence complicates the assembly process. Assembly contiguity and completeness is significantly lower than would have been expected in the absence of heterozygosity  [60] . Commercial citrus varieties are characterized by high heterozygosity levels  [6, 7] . The comparison of blind versus ""known-haplotype"" assemblies of shotgun sequences obtained from a set of BAC clones from the heterozygous sweet orange  [61]  led the ICGC to establish the reference sequence of the citrus genome from a homozygous genotype. A haploid plant derived from the Clementine was selected due to its immediate availability and preexisting molecular resources  [26, 27, [62] [63] [64] . The selected haploid was obtained by induced gynogenesis after in situ pollination with irradiated pollen  [13] . The haploid Clementine was genotyped using the markers mapped in diploid Clementine and sweet orange. This permitted the constitution of the haploid genome to be determined according to the mandarin and sweet orange haplotypes constitutive of the diploid Clementine. Eight recombination break points were identified between the two Clementine haplotypes (one in LG1, LG7 and LG8; two in LG 5 and three in LG3). LG2, LG4, LG6 and LG9 appear to have been entirely inherited from the 'Mediterranean' mandarin haplotype without recombination. Overall, a very large fraction of the genome of the haploid Clementine used for WGS was inherited from the 'Mediterranean' mandarin. 
 Conclusions Five parental genetic maps were established from three segregating populations that were genotyped using SNP, SSR and Indel markers. A first medium density reference map (961 markers for 1084.1cM) of citrus was established by joining male and female Clementine segregation data. Despite the heterogeneous dispersion of markers, this constitutes a good framework for further marker-trait association studies, and it has been used to enable the chromosome assembly of the reference whole genome citrus sequence  [39] . The Clementine map was compared with two pummelo maps ('Chandler' map: 151 markers for 828.6 cM; 'Pink' map: 81 markers for 633 cM) and a sweet orange map (569 markers for 669.6 cM). The linear order of the markers appeared to be highly conserved at the interspecific level. This should allow for reasonable inferences of most citrus genome sequences via mapping NGS re-sequencing data in the haploid Clementine reference genome sequence. Important variations between the Clementine and sweet orange map sizes were observed, as well as variations between the male and female Clementine maps. This suggests variations in recombination rates. The smaller length of the sweet orange map is likely related to the higher interspecific heterozygosity within the sweet orange genome. Skewed segregations are numerous in the male Clementine map, underlining the potential extent of deviation from Mendelian segregation for characters controlled by heterozygous loci in the male parent. Genetic mapping data confirmed that the Clementine is a hybrid between the 'Mediterranean' mandarin and sweet orange. Nine recombination break points were identified between the two sweet orange haplotypes for the sweet orange gamete that contributed to the Clementine genome. The genome of the haploid Clementine used to establish the citrus reference sequence appears to be have been primarily inherited from the 'Mediterranean' mandarin haplotype of the diploid Clementine. 
 Materials and methods Segregating progenies and DNA extraction Clementine and pummelo genetic mapping Two inter-specific segregating populations between C. clementina and C. maxima were used to establish the genetic maps. One hundred and fifty-six hybrids of 'Chandler' pummelo × 'Nules' Clementine (CP × NC) were produced and grown at CIRAD/INRA (Corsica), while 140 hybrids of 'Nules' Clementine × 'Pink' pummelo (NC × PP) were obtained at IVIA. Total DNA was extracted from fresh leaves according to Doyle and Doyle  [65] . In addition to the interspecific hybrids, total DNA was extracted from the parental lines: diploid 'Nules' Clementine (IVIA-22), 'Chandler' pummelo (ICVN 0100608) and 'Pink' Pummelo (IVIA-275). DNA was also extracted from the haploid Clementine selected for the whole genome sequence implementation and 'Mediterranean' mandarin (IVIA-154), the assumed female parent of Clementine. 
 Sweet orange genetic mapping One hundred and forty seven intergeneric hybrids between sweet orange and trifoliate orange (Citrus sinensis × Poncirus trifoliata; SO × TO) were used for sweet orange mapping using SNP markers shared with the Clementine map. These hybrids were obtained at UF-CREC (Florida) and previously used for sweet orange and trifoliate orange mapping using SSR markers  [19] . The different crosses used were: (i) 56 hybrids of C. sinensis cv Sanford (Sa) × P. trifoliata cv Argentina (Ar), (ii) 40 hybrids of C. sinensis cv Fiwicke (Fi) × P. trifoliata cv Flying Dragon (FD); (iii) 15 hybrids of C. sinensis cv Ridge Pineapple (RP) × P. trifoliata cv Flying Dragon (FD), (iv) seven hybrids of C. sinensis cv Fiwicke (Fi) × P. trifoliata cv Argentina (Ar); (v) six hybrids of C. sinensis cv Ruby (Ru) × P. trifoliata cv Flying Dragon (FD), (vi) five hybrids of C. sinensis cv Ridge Pineapple (RP) × P. trifoliata cv DPI0906 (Ps), (vii) five hybrids of C. sinensis cv Ruby (Ru) × P. trifoliata Argentina cv (Ar), and (viii) 13 hybrids of P. trifoliata cv Flying Dragon (FD) × C. sinensis Ridge cv Pineapple (RP). Due to the nature of C. sinensis intraspecific evolution (somatic mutations but not sexual recombination), molecular polymorphisms between sweet orange cultivars is very rare  [8, 19] . Therefore, after confirming the lack of polymorphism between parental sweet oranges at the marker loci, all of the hybrids were considered to be derived from a single sweet orange genotype for the mapping analysis. Prior to DNA extraction, the ploidy level of all hybrids was estimated by flow cytometry, and only diploid hybrids were used. Genomic DNA was isolated from tender leaves using the CTAB method as described by Aldrich and Cullis  [66] . 
 Markers A total of 1166 markers were used to genotype the progenies. Of these markers, 837 were SNPs, 301 were SSRs and 28 were Indels. Ranger (BMA, Rockland, ME, USA) polyacrylamide gel attached to a LI-COR IR2 4200LR Global DNA sequencer dual dye system. Alleles were sized manually by comparison with 50-350 bp size standards (LI-COR), and then scored manually from gel image files. More details can be found in Barkley et al.  [6] . 
 Indels Indel markers were genotyped by Capillary Gel Electrophoresis (CEQ™ 8000 Genetic Analysis System; Beckman Coulter Inc.) using wellRED oligonucleotides (Sigma W ) as described by Ollitrault et al.  [34] . Data collection and analysis were performed with GenomeLab™ GeXP software, version 10.0. 
 SNPs All SNP markers were genotyped on a GoldenGate array platform according to the standard Illumina GoldenGate assay instructions (www.illumina.com). More details can be found in Ollitrault et al.  [8] . Two genotype controls ('Nules' Clementine and 'Chandler' pummelo) were repeated twice in each plate. The data were collected and analyzed using the Genome Studio software (Illumina). The automatic allele calling was visually checked for each marker/plate and corrected if necessary. 
 Linkage analysis and genetic mapping The two-way pseudo-testcross mapping strategy was used to determine the linkages in the different F1 populations from the two heterozygous parents as previously described  [72]  and used in previous mapping studies in citrus  [17, 19, 73] . Each progeny was analyzed with Join-Map 4.0  [74] . The genotyping data were coded according to the ""CP"" population option adapted for such two-way pseudo-testcrosses with no previous knowledge of the marker linkage phases. In the first step, JoinMap was used to establish male and female gamete populations, which were analyzed separately. Segregation distortion was tested by χ2 conformity tests against the Mendelian segregation ratio of 1:1. Linkage analysis and marker grouping were performed using the independence LOD and a minimum threshold LOD=4. Phases (coupling and repulsion) of the linked marker loci were automatically detected by the software. Map distances were established in centiMorgans (cM) using the regression mapping algorithm and the Kosambi mapping function. Given that missing observations have much less negative impact on the quality of the map than errors, several authors recommend identifying suspicious data and treating them as missing observations  [75, 76] . In high density genetic mapping, a genotype error usually manifests itself as a singleton (or a double cross-over) under a reasonably accurate ordering of the markers. A singleton is a locus whose phase is different from both the marker phases immediately before and after. A reasonable strategy to deal with genotyping errors is to remove singletons by treating them as missing observations, and then refine the map by running the ordering algorithm  [75, 76] . For the Clementine map in which a relatively high number of markers was genotyped, singletons were automatically checked after a first mapping round and replaced by missing data using an excel page routine. The Clementine maps were established from these cleaned data. Distorted markers were not removed from the analysis because they were very frequent for some parents. Moreover, using JoinMap, each grouping of linked loci was based upon a test for independence in a contingency table. Since the test for independence is not affected by segregation distortion like the LOD score used by other methods of linkage analysis, a lower incidence of spurious linkage is expected  [74] . The linkage maps were drawn using the MapChart program  [77] . The circle plot diagram used to compare the marker order in four genetic maps was performed using Circos software (http:// circos.ca/). Clementine and sweet orange haplotypes were drawn with GGT 2.0 software  [78] . Figure 1 1 Assumed parentage relationships between C. reticulata, C. maxima, C. sinensis and C. clementina.

 Jatropha curcas as a ""Miracle Tree"" The physic nut shrub, Jatropha curcas (Euphorbiaceae), has been considered as a ""miracle tree"", particularly as a source of alternate fuel, since seed oil can be used as a substitute to diesel oil  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Besides its production for this use (which ""boomed"" in recent years), the shrub is grown as live hedges to combat erosion, or as live fences to protect market gardens from domestic animals  [8] . This adds to the more or less traditional use of the shrub for other purposes, particularly as medicines, in many parts of the world  [9] . 
 Biocidal Effects of J. curcas Extracts Besides effect on human pathogens  [10, 11] , various extracts of the plant have been reported to have insecticidal/acaricidal or molluscicidal/anthelminthic activities on vectors of medical or veterinary interest or on non-agricultural pests. These encompass mosquitoes  [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , mites  [18, 19] , cockroaches  [20] , houseflies  [21] , termites  [22] [23] [24] [25] , and water snails hosts of human or cattle parasites (especially schistosomes)  [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Toxicity of extracts of other species of Jatropha (e.g., J. gossypifolia or J. podagrica) has also been reported  [35, 36] . Among J. curcas extracts, the main biocidal action has been ascribed to the phorbol ester (tetracyclic diterpenoid) fraction  [37, 38]  from seed oil. Six phorbol esters (Jatropha factors C1-C6) have been characterized from J. curcas seed oil with the molecular formula C 44 H 54 O 8 Na, as intra-molecular diesters of the same diterpene, 12-deoxy-16-hydroxyphorbol. Biocidal, including insecticidal activity of phorbol esters is due to the stimulation of the cellular target protein kinase C (PKC). Toxic phorbol esters are also found in other genera of the Euphorbiaceae family, particularly Croton and Euphorbia  [39] . This fraction has also been reported as a promising candidate for use as a plant-derived protectant of a variety of crops, from a range of pre-harvest and post-harvest insect pests. On the other hand, the physic nut tree is also subject to damage by several pests  [40] [41] [42] [43] , but these insects are often specialists which are adapted to the toxicity of their host plant. Some specialists, such as the aposematic Pachycoris klugii (Hemiptera) may even sequester phorbol ester as chemical defense means against predators  [44] . A few varieties of J. curcas, which have been selected by plant breeders, do not accumulate phorbol esters; the seed oil is no longer toxic to animals  [37] . Seeds also contain a toxic lectin (a peptide) which however does not appear in the pressed oil  [37] . The aim of this review is to take stock of all reported work on the insecticidal effect of physic nut (particularly J. curcas) and its extracts (particularly the oil and its phorbol ester fraction) on crop pests, and analyze the reasons for the lack of practical applications of the acquired knowledge, notably its translation into commercial products. 
 Insecticidal Activity of J. curcas Extracts (Particularly Phorbol Esters) on Pre-and Post-Harvest Crop Pests 
 Crops Studied There are 10 crops on which J. curcas extracts have shown potential for protection against insect pests  (Table 1) . Field crops encompass cotton  [45, 46] , cowpea  [47, 48] , maize  [49] , musk melon  [50] , okra  [51] , rice  [50, 52, 53] , and sorghum  [54] . Stored crops encompass bean seeds  [55] , cowpea seeds  [56] , maize grain  [57] [58] [59] , mungbean seeds  [46] , potato tubers  [60, 61] , rice grain  [62, 63] , and wheat grain  [64] . It should however be noted that not all studies involved relevant control/blanks to make sure that reported effects were due to the extracts, and not the solvents (e.g.,  [50] , as opposed to  [47] ).  
 Crop Pests Studied There are 37 insect pest species against which J. curcas extracts have been employed, and have shown biological activity (  Table 2) .   [47, 48]  Coleoptera were the most represented, with 13 species in six families, encompassing mainly stored grain-feeding beetles  [22, 46, [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [62] [63] [64] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] 80] , flea beetles  [51, 65, 72]  and a flower weevil  [81] . Lepidoptera were the second most represented order, with 12 species in seven families, encompassing stem boring and leaf-feeding caterpillars  [50, 52, 72, 74, 75, [77] [78] [79] , fruit or head-feeding caterpillars  [45, 46, 49, 50, 54, 66, 72, 76] , and the potato tuber moth  [60] . They were followed by sap-feeding piercing-sucking Hemiptera, with 11 species in five families  [46] [47] [48] 53, 54, 66, 72, 73, 78] . Two studies showed activity on a flower thrips  [47, 48] , and one a grasshopper species  [82] . 
 Types of Extracts and of Effects Extracts that were studied and showed biological activity against insect pests of crops were mainly oil extracts, particularly phorbol esters (  Table 3) . Range of biocidal/biostatic pathways is quite broad  (Table 3) , encompassing contact toxicity on all developmental stages, ingestion toxicity, feeding deterrency and repellency  (Table 3) .  Table 3 . Types of extracts evaluated and types of effects highlighted in reported studies. 
 Type of extract Reported type of effect Reference 
 Aqueous extract Contact toxicity and partial chemo-sterilizing effect; delayed molting; morphogenetic lethal effect after topical application; chronic toxicity  [66]  Leaf extracts inhibition of oviposition, anti-feedent and insecticidal effects  [58]  Dry seed powder acetone extract Contact toxicity, ingestion toxicity  [  Cessation of growth and development  [72, 79]  Oil and phorbol esters Contact toxicity, ingestion toxicity, ovicidal effects and reduction of development/fertility of progeny  [54]  Phorbol esters Stomach toxicity and antifeeding activity  [78]  Phorbol esters Contact toxicity; reduction of food consumption, relative growth and food conversion efficiency  [77]  The most studied pest family has been that of Noctuidae, with 10 studies on 5 species (at par with Aphididae, but with only 4 studies on the latter). Noctuid caterpillars were either leaf feeding, stem boring, or fruit boring species, and were studied mainly in the laboratory, although some field tests on Helicoverpa armigera were conducted on cotton  [22]  and musk melon  [50] . For H. armigera on cotton, synthetic insecticides were more effective than Jatropha oil (at the dose of 800 mL ha −1 ) at the start of treatment, as the oil affects only insect growth and its effect is therefore slower. On musk melon, a 70% reduction of infestation over the control was observed with a concentration of 0.5 mg mL −1 of methanol extract of Jatropha oil (dosage per ha not known). As concentrations of phorbol esters in one of the studies on H. armigera  [54]  were actually mistakenly reported in g mL −1 instead of mg mL −1 , in all laboratory studies, effective concentrations either for contact or ingestion deterrency/toxicity effect were consistently in the range between 0.1 and 1 mg mL −1 of phorbol esters (or their equivalent in oil). However, one should be cautious concerning the efficiency of such extracts under field conditions, as translated by the little numbers of actual field tests. In addition, species with cryptic caterpillars like stem borers, particularly Sesamia calamistis, which does not have any wandering larval stage, and fruit worms (e.g., Helicoverpa spp.) are more difficult to control than leaf-feeding species. Foliar spraying targeting the latter (e.g., Spodoptera frugiperda) may on the other hand result in phytotoxicity on the crop (namely leaf burns), not necessarily due to phorbol esters per se, but to the oil or adjuvants in some formulations  [22, 47] . 
 Lack of Development of Biocidal (Particularly Crop Pest Insecticidal) Applications of J. curcas Extracts and Potential Explanations Since the first records of Jatropha oil biocidal activities on crop insect pests, almost thirty years ago, such extracts have not been widely used, despite the ""boom"" in the development of the crop in the tropics for biodiesel purpose during recent years, and increased public awareness of adverse environmental impacts of synthetic chemical insecticide use. Phorbol esters activate PKC  [39] . PKC is involved in several cellular signaling pathways. Some of them are active in cancer cells. If PKC is activated in cancer cells, their growth can be stimulated. Because of this property toxicologist classify phorbol esters as ""co-carcinogens"" or tumor-promoting. This term is somewhat misleading to the non-toxicologists, because it is easily mistaken for a carcinogen which can cause cancer. It should be remembered, that also estrogens, which are the active ingredients of anti-baby pills, have been classified as co-carcinogens because they stimulate growth of hormone-dependent cancer cells. The co-carcinogenic property of phorbol esters should not be an apriori ""no-go"" for a registration. Such a lack of use was also reported for other plant-derived insecticides, deterrents, and repellents  [83, 84] . The main barriers to commercialization for botanical insecticides include: sustainability of the botanical resource, standardization of chemically complex extracts, and regulatory approval. The latter process is as cumbersome and expensive for a botanical insecticide as for a synthetic compound. Because it is difficult or even impossible to obtain patents for such phorbol ester extracts, agrochemical companies are not inclined to spend large amounts of money for toxicological tests and efficacy trials that are required for registration and approval as biopesticides. 
 High Variability of Phorbol Ester Content and Difficulty of Extraction High variability of phorbol ester content and hence of insecticidal activity among physic nut cultivars/ecotypes  [37]  may be an explanation. This however can be solved by extraction/concentration, but this is not easy to achieve at the village level  [75] . The analysis of phorbol esters requires sophisticated laboratory equipment such as HPLC and LC-MS  [37, 72] , which is often lacking in tropical countries or in agricultural laboratories. Therefore, the selection of high-yielding varieties is difficult and labor-extensive. Furthermore, most emphasis in breeding of physic nuts was on the selection of varieties which were low on phorbol esters so that they could be used for animal or human consumption. 
 Non-Relevance of Application on Stored Grain Another reason for the lack of development of pesticide uses might be the relevance of the application of such toxic extracts  [39]  on stored grain aimed at human consumption (  Table 1 ). The fact that most studies refer to such post-harvest pests as Callosobruchus maculatus or Sitophilus zeamais (  Table 2)  is probably just an indication that these pests are easier to study than field pests, and that use of botanicals on stored produce is a traditional practice, more than on field crops. On the other hand, human toxicity is mainly ascribed to the curcin protein which occurs in the seed meal but not in the oil. Seed oil also contains hydrogen cyanide. While phorbol esters, as co-carcinogenic (and not carcinogenic per se) compounds  [39] , are considered as less of a problem, although concentrated solutions are irritant to skin and eyes. Another problem could be toxicity of the extracts against germinating plants (phytotoxicity). At least, if cereal grains are used as seeds, their germination is not affected ruling out a phytotoxic effect of phorbol esters at this level  [57] . 
 Lack of Studies under Real Conditions On both storage and field pests, studies were mainly conducted under laboratory conditions, so that potential field problems such as efficiency and persistence under natural conditions, phytotoxicity on crops (either of the oil, or of adjuvants in phorbol ester formulations  [22, 47] ), and environmental fate, remain to be studied. The problem of decomposition of phorbol esters and other toxic compounds in the field (from UV light and/or microbes) needs further evaluation before insecticidal or molluscicidal oil extracts can be widely used. This fact may actually also be a partial explanation to their lack of use. On the other hand, recent results showed that phorbol esters are biodegradable in the soil  [85] . Further to the case of storage pests, this is another instance of conflicting effects between biological/biocidal activity against pests and persistence/innocuity for humans and the environment. Biodegradability and low persistence in the soil are a plus regarding human health and pollution, but a minus regarding bioactivity on soil pests (e.g., nematodes, on which there are several reports of bioactivity of Jatropha extracts, particularly oil seed cake  [86] [87] [88] ). A trade-off/balance has therefore to be found. Regarding effects on non-target arthropods, low toxicity of extracts of other species of Jatropha was reported on beneficial insects or mites, namely predators  [89, 90] , while conflicting results were obtained with J. curcas extracts on parasitoids  [70] . On the other hand, in a field study, the better cotton yield with Jatropha oil treatment over farmer conventional practice was ascribed to the innocuity of oil for natural enemies  [22] . In any case, further to studies on evaluation of toxicity to natural enemies of insect pests, such studies on other beneficial insects like pollinating insects and honeybees are still needed  [91] . 
 Conclusions 
 Prospects for the Development of J. curcas Extract Uses for Crop Protection All the studies discussed indicate that extracts from Jatropha spp. (and particularly J. curcas) leaves, seeds and oil are repellent, deterrent or toxic, either by contact or ingestion, to several agricultural insect pests. The extracts involved mainly contain toxic diterpenes (particularly phorbol esters). While the development of Jatropha cultivation for its mere insecticidal properties is unlikely, insecticidal compounds such as phorbol esters can be valuable by-products wherever the plant is grown as live-hedges or garden fences, or for biodiesel. As a biofuel (biodiesel), Jatropha has the highest potential in isolated or land-locked countries (e.g., small islands or Sahelian countries), where it has a clear comparative advantage over imported fossil fuels. As mentioned above, in these contexts, phorbol ester extracts could be obtained as a rather cheap by-product of biodiesel production and would be available in developing countries which cannot afford to buy expensive agrochemicals. Furthermore, these nonrenewable chemical plant protection products are under threat of being banned anyway, due to their documented adverse effects on human health and the environment. The extraction of the phorbol ester fraction of the seed oil of J. curcas using for example methanol as a solvent, does not affect its biodiesel properties  [92] , so that a small part of oil could be enriched with phorbol esters and used as a plant-derived insecticide. Such a ""detoxification"" could also help other uses, including as edible oil. Actually, such an ""enrichment"" would probably be the best trade-off  [31] , since these compounds are protected from heat when they are in oil, while their shelf-life is considerably reduced when they are extracted  [93] . It should however be noted that such extraction/enrichment processes are not possible at the farmer level since it involves the use of solvents e.g. methanol, but could still be done at the village level at a semi-centralized scale (e.g., that of the village power plant)  [75] . 
 Potential for Combination of Jatropha Extracts with Other Control Options in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) or Agroecological Strategies In view of its at least partial effects on crop pests, application of Jatropha oil or its phorbol ester fraction could be complementary with other control methods such as impregnated nets  [94] . Actually, such a technique should be cost-effective on high-value crops such as vegetables or ""concentrated"" products such as or stored produce. Furthermore, the reported antifungal properties of Jatropha extracts  [95] [96] [97] [98] [99] [100] [101]  could make it for the potential increased fungal infection risk due to microclimate alteration (higher humidity) under such nets. Another option would be to combine the biocidal activity of Jatropha extracts and the use of trap plants, in a ""push-pull"" strategy, as we discussed earlier  [54] . The phorbol ester fraction could also be combined with other botanical pesticides (see  [83]  for a review) that attack different molecular targets in pest organisms. Phorbol esters mainly activate PKC  [72]  and related signal transduction pathways. Their combination with a neurotoxin (e.g., nicotine, lupin alkaloids:  [83] ) might result in a synergistic efficacy. In synergistic combinations the dose of the individual component can be reduced, thus minimizing adverse effects, while delaying the emergence of resistant pest strains. On the other hand, due to its documented toxicity on water snails hosts of human or cattle parasites  [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] , or agricultural pests  [22] , more studies should be conducted on molluscicidal activity on slugs and land snails which are major pests of crops in conservation agriculture  [102] , where risk of phytotoxicity and leaching is low, the product being applied on the (thick) mulch  [103, 104] . Broadly speaking, based on the existing literature and in view of the likely development of Jatropha cultivation in the tropics, the study of the insecticidal effects of its seed oil, particularly phorbol esters, and their evaluation in real conditions, should be given priority, rather than screening of novel active bioactive substances.

Because the camel has developed various adaptive mechanisms for living in the desert, its rearing is regarded like a constant resource for sustenance in the arid lands. Without camel, the rural life in these areas will be abandoned  (Abbas et al., 2000) . In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) where less than 1% of the lands are suitable for cultivation  (Hussain and Al-Saati, 1999) , the camel population is estimated to stand at more than 830000 heads (Ministry of  Agriculture, 2006)  and is considered as a national socio-cultural heritage. The camel population is regularly growing by 5.2%/year (source: FAOstat, 2010) since 1961, date of the first FAO official statistics. The camel population represented more than 50% of the total livestock unit in the country which is one of the highest in the world (source: FAOstat, 2010). Thus, the camel production is still central in the livestock economy of KSA. The life of Saudi Arabians still living in rural areas is effectively closely connected to the camel which was domesticated in the Arabian Peninsula thousands of years ago  (Uerpman and Uerpman, 2002) . The camel has played and will continue to play an effective and pivotal role in the history and society of KSA. Nowadays, the camel farming systems are changing due to the urbanization, climatic changes and growth of the economy of KSA  (Auty, 2001) . Thus, traditional Bedouin way of life is probably changing. To understand how the camel farming systems are adapting and changing, the achievement of farm typology is a current tool used by the researchers and development institutes  (Djurfeldt, 1996) . A typology is a method to get an image of the diversity of farming systems in a determined zone. In the present study, a typological analysis of the current situation in some regions of KSA was achieved by focusing on structural aspects (herd composition) and functional aspects (moving strategies, feeding practices, diseases prevention practices, links to market). The objective of the present study was to determine the main current farming systems devoted to camel in different regions of KSA in order to underline the farm diversity and the probable changes in camel utilization. 
 Materials and Methods To achieve the typology several methods could be used, by segmentation, by expert's knowledge or by automatic classification using a questionnaire with closed questions. The segmentation method is based on the hierarchy of identification keys as described by  Breiman et al. (1984) . The method by expert's knowledge is based on the aggregation of farms around poles defined by experts having a good a priori knowledge of the existing systems  (Perrot, 1990) . The method by automatic classification is based on statistical analysis of typological questionnaire using clustering method  (Späth, 1980) . The convenient identification keys being not known and in absence of identified experts on camel farming systems, the method based on automatic classification was used in the present study. 
 Data collection The data were collected by interviews based on questionnaires with close questions. The interviews were conducted from February 2009 to July 2010. The farmers were chosen randomly by the Ministry of Agriculture from several regions. A number of 218 camel owners were interviewed. They belonged to different tribes coming from 7 regions: Skaka (n=70 farms), Arar (n=20), Tabuk (n=35), Al-Qaseem (n=25), Hail (n=30), Tabarjal (n=25) and Dammam (n=13). The questionnaire included four page data form and was filled out for each camel farm. The interview took approximately 45 to 95 min per farmer. The questionnaire included 59 questions and was divided into the following five sections: -Section 1 contained 8 questions regarding information on camel owner identity and its activities (status, place of living, number of herds) -Section 2 contained 15 questions regarding the descriptions on the herd (number of camel, types and age of the camel, presence of other species…). -Section 3 contained 20 questions focused on breed description (coat color, size…). -Section 4 contained 4 questions only regarding informations on feeding and moving strategy (period and areas of moving, production system…) -Section 5. Included 12 questions regarding informations on diseases (prevention for ticks, internal and external parasites, vaccinations…). 
 Statistical analysis The questionnaire included quantitative and qualitative data. In order to get homogenous data for multivariate analysis, the data preparation involved five steps. 1. Univariate description of the variables (distribution of quantitative variables, number of modalities of qualitative variables). Variables with imbalanced modalities were discarded. The quantitative data were transformed into qualitative variable with modalities according to the distribution of the quantitative values  (Snrka and Koeszegi, 2007) . 2. Estimation of fecundity rate and mortality rate according to the known number of birth and dead animals within one year, reported to the number of adult females and the total number of animals respectively. For this estimation, we used the method proposed by  Lesnoff et al. (2011) . 3. Building synthetic variables describing similar topic. For example, herd composition included several questions on the presence or not of different species. After identifying the main combinations of data by cluster analysis, a new variable was created entitled ""animals present in the herd"" with two modalities: (i) pure camel herd or (ii) camel herd associated to small ruminants and/or cow. Similar approach was achieved for breed composition of the camel herd, camel diet (combination of different foods), camel marketing (selling and/or buying animals), and combination of practice diseases prevention. Finally, from the 59 questions in the previous questionnaire, a total of 31 variables were retained in the final multivariate analysis  (Table 1) . 4. Multivariate analysis of group of variables: four groups of variables were analyzed, i.e. (i) farmer's data, (ii) herd data, (iii) management practice data (feeding, fattening, moving, marketing) and (iv) disease prevention data. After automatic classification using the method of Ascending Hierarchical Classification (AHC) on Ward distance  (Tuffery, 2010) , types of farmer, herd, practice and disease prevention practices were identified. The principle of the method of automatic classification (or clustering) was based on the identification of homogeneous groups of individuals (clusters) in the population (here, camel herds). Two camel herds belonging to the same group were somehow close to each other (similar structures or practices). At reverse, two camel herds belonging to different groups are somehow far from each other (they have different structures and/or practices). The classification consists to build a partition of the population into homogenous clusters (having low within variability), different one from other (having high between variability). Each retained cluster, identified by the convenient cutting of a dendrogram (graphic expressing the dissimilarity between clusters or classes) would represent a ""type"". The convenience of the cutting was estimated when the gain in between-cluster variance is not significant. The retained clustering is expressed by the total between-cluster variance explained by the model. The interpretation of the types was achieved by analyzing the contribution of the different variables to the class. Only variables with significant contribution (assessed by Chi square test) at P >0.05 were retained for the final interpretation. 5. Final multivariate analysis of a data table including the types of farmers, types of herd, types of practices and types of diseases prevention practices, identified in the previous step. A final typology was proposed and interpreted, notably by calculating some quantitative data (number of camels, buying rate, selling rate, fecundity rate, and mortality rate) in each types and by testing the difference with variance analysis (ANOVA). For all the statistical analysis used (ANOVA, AHC, chi square test), the software XLstat© was used (Addinsoft, 2007: http://www.xlstat.com).   
 Results The whole camel owners' population (n=218) corresponded to a camel population of 14394 camels, representing approximately 8% of the official number of camel in the involved regions of the country (based on FAO statistics). The herd size was 66 ± 89 on average. Among the present sampled camel population, the main breed was Waddah (55.6%) followed by Shual (17.1%), Majaheem (12.4%), Homor (10.5%) and Sofor (4.6%). The marketing rate was on average 16.8% (sold and buy) with a selling rate (number of sold camel/total number of camels in the herd) of 10.1%, but with a high variability between farmers. The annual mortality rate was on average 16.6 ± 20.9% (all age classes) and birth rate (number of birth reported on number of expected pregnant females) was 96.4 ± 90.6%. For the last 12 months, the fecundity rate (number of birth reported on the total number of adult females) was estimated to 45.2 ± 32.7%. The four groups of variables (farmer, herd, management practices and disease prevention) were analyzed separately. At the end, 4 typologies were obtained. 
 Types of farmers After classification of data describing the farmer (variables 1 to 5), 5 types of farmers were identified explaining 74.9% of the total variance between-classes  (Figure 1 ). According to the contribution of the different variables to the clusters, the types of farmers could be summarized as follow: (1) urban camel owner having camel as hobby and working in security field (n=67); (2) pure camel farmer living in desert (n=80); (3) Urban camel farmer having camel as hobby and working in public sector (n=20); (4) retired farmer with one or several herds partly in desert (n=36); (5) shepherd or supervisor from different origin (n=15). 
 Types of herd As for farmers, 5 types of herd were identified after classification of data (variables 6 to 12) describing the herds  (Figure 2 ). The retained model into 5 clusters explained 46.2% of the betweencluster variance. According to the significant variables contributing to the classes, the types of herds could be described as follow: (1) medium camel herd with different breeds, low fertility and commercial use (n=56); (2) camel herd of different size with more similar breeds widely involved in camel market and high turn-over (n=62); (3) small camel herd poorly market integrated (n=40); (4) Majahim small camel herd more or less market integrated (n=20); (5) Waddah small camel herd with good fertility rate (n=40).  
 Types of management practices With similar method involving data describing the farmer's practices (variables 13 to 22), 4 types of practices were identified explaining 40.7% of the total between-classes variance (  Figure 3 ). The classes were interpreted according to the 8 significant variables as follow: (1) Farmer moving, no fattening animals and distributing green fodder without supplement (n=58); (2) Farmer moving, practicing late fattening and well integrated to market (n=42); (3) Farmer moving, practicing early fattening but well integrated to market (n=87); (4) No moving camel, no fattening, but branding young animals, distribution of barley and selling animal to market (n=31).   
 Types of prevention practices After classification of data describing the practice of disease prevention (variables 23 to 31), 6 types of practices were identified explaining 75.1% of the total between-classes variance (  Figure  4 ). Only 6 variables contributed significantly to the classes and could be interpreted as follow: (1) Low health management (n=78); (2) High health management (n=49); (3) Traditional health treatment (n=16); (4) No health management (n=32); (5) Parasite management mainly (n=25); (6) Traditional prevention against parasite (n=18). The use of traditional medicine or ethnoveterinary medicine (mainly by using desert plant) rather than medicine from the market was more common for treating camel parasites as mange or ringworm. 
 Camel farm types In the last step, a global classification of the camel farms described by their 4 different clusters identified in the previous steps was achieved, and gave a balanced dendrogram including four main classes divided each into two sub-types explaining 70.2% of the total between-classes variance. Those types could be interpreted as follows (  Figure 5 ):  Figure 5 . Dendrogram (dissimilarity tree) obtained after from final cluster analysis of the data table where the camel owners are described by their types of farmer, herd, practice and disease prevention, and convenient level of cutting according to the optimal between cluster-variance (----) giving eight types of camel farms. The first type contained pure camel farmers living more or less exclusively by their camel rearing. They are divided into 2 sub-types:  Type 1a (16.1% of the camel farms): Pure camel farmers having big herd, living in desert and regularly moving, using green fodder sometimes added with mineral and vitamin, no fattening practice (2/3 of the cases) or late fattening (1/3 of the cases), more or less integrated to market, with low health management. They can be regarded as pure camel farmers having big herd with traditional way of life more or less integrated to market.  Type 1b (17.4%): Moving pure camel farmers with homogeneous herd (only one breed), high turn-over to camel market, practicing early fattening for camel market, but low (55% of the cases) or high (45%) health management. They could be defined as pure camel farmer with higher integration to market and modernized management. The second type was retired people still keeping camel for different purposes. They can be divided into 2 sub-types again:  Type 2a (8.3% of the sample): retired people or shepherd with low reproductive performances, variable health management, given supplementation in diet with barley, weak integration to market. They could be defined as retired people keeping camel for hobby.  Type 2b (23.9% of the sample): retired people with low or traditional health management but with very high market integration, adding mineral and vitamin in the diet. They are clearly retired people having camel for market activity. The third type included pure camel farmer or multi-active people with small herd but good integration to market, and health management focused on parasite prevention. The 2 sub-types could be described as follows:  Type 3a (12.8%): Pure camel farmer living in desert with small or medium camel herd composed of one breed only, low reproductive performance but commercial use with more or less good health management. They are moving herds. They can be defined as small pure camel farmer well integrated to market but with low management  Type 3b (4.1%): Multi-active farmers (security work) with small camel herd (mainly Waddah), good reproductive performance but only parasite prevention, management with traditional drugs, moving or not moving herd, well integrated to market: They are Multi-active farmer with small herd using camel for market but with traditional management. The fourth type was mainly multi-active owners practicing camel rearing as hobby but looking for proper management. They could be divided into  Type 4a (8.7%): Camel farmer living in city, multi-active or sometimes retired, herd having one breed only with good reproductive performance, but rather low market integration and low health management in spite of a good calf mortality control. They are multi-active retired farmer using camel for hobby with low commercial objective and health management.  Type 4b (8.7%): Multi-active owner (mainly from security field), herd having one breed only with high reproductive performance but with moving animals and better commercial objective than 4a. They could be defined as multi-active owner looking for proper commercial management. In order to interpret the identified types, some quantitative variables were estimated: number of camels per herd, buying rate, selling rate, fecundity rate, and young mortality rate (  Table 2 ). The number of camels was significantly higher in type 1a while the marketing rate was significantly higher in type 2b. No significant difference was observed for annual fecundity rate (from 30.4 to 53.0%) and mortality rate (from 10.5 to 20.6%) in spite of a high observed variability.  
 Discussion The typology of camel farming is a common tool to understand the organization and/or the strategies of the camel owners. It is generally helpful for the people in charge of the rural development, because the recommendations could change according to the type of farmers and of their activities. Camel farming typologies were already achieved in Morocco  (Michel et al., 1997) , in Niger  (Chaibou and Faye, 2005) , in Mauritania  (Correra et al., 2009) and in India (Laval et al., 1998; Benard et al., 2008) . A description regarding dairy camel systems was also available in Sudan  (Eisa and Mustafa, 2011) . In Saudi Arabia, livestock farming systems were described according to the ecosystem where livestock is reared and according to the link with agriculture  (Boum, 2003) . Some references on the herding strategies and health performances in Saudi camel farms were available but limited to restricted area  (Abbas et al., 2000) . Few data published in scientific papers were available for specific description of camel farming system, notably according to the husbandry practices . Traditionally, livestock systems in Saudi Arabia like in most of the arid countries are divided into nomad (or transhumant) systems and settled systems  (Jasra and Mirza, 2005) . But this distribution did not underline the differences between the farmers' strategies and practices. At the national level, a recent report  (Mahmoudi, 2010)  had identified 6 types of camel farms including commercial farm, racing farm, camel farm for leisure (""week-end farm""), camel farm for renting, traditional farm, and camel for prestige. This typology was based on a simplified questionnaire including essentially data on farmer and herd composition, but little information on practices. In the survey published by  Abbas et al. (2000) , four types were described in Qassim region as commercial dairies, prestige herders, pastoralist and agropastoralist herders and periurban feedlots, but this typology was based on a priori classification. In the present study, the identification of the farming systems were focused on four items: (i) the farmer status, (ii) the herd composition, (iii) the main practices which are the classical parameters used to describe livestock system  (Lhoste et al., 1993)  defined as the interaction between the farmer, the herd and the farming conditions. This approach was applied both in cattle production  (Lhoste, 1984)  and camel production  (Saini et al., 2006) . Prevention practices (iv) were added in order to take in consideration the importance of this item in camel management. Of course, some items were lacking for an exhaustive understanding of the owner's strategies as education level, age pyramid of the camel herd, reasons for culling, disease prevalence, individual reproductive performances, etc. However, a questionnaire is a compromise with the acceptable time for the interview, and some data could be reliable by monitoring only (longitudinal study). A typological questionnaire is applied in a crosssectional survey with limiting time of interview in order to give the priority to the number of interviewed owners. In Saudi Arabia, the place of camel in the social life is very central because it is a heritage of the Bedouin culture. This explains the importance of camel rearing without economical purpose and the fact that many people having another activities or being retired wanted to have camels. Among the eight types described in the present study, there was also a clear distinction between farmers living in desert with moving animals and those living in cities, having other professional activities but keeping camel around the city or in desert. The role of camel in that sense was fundamentally a matter of social satisfaction rather than economical target. However, this distinction is not always strict as the present typology showed. Even urban owners having multi-activities could be highly integrated into market, could search proper management of disease and production performance. For example, the type 2b gathering mainly retired people, has on average a significant higher selling rate and buying rate (54.3 and 68.9% respectively) compared to the other types. However, owners keeping their animal mainly for hobby (type 2a) had a lower fecundity performance (around 30%) and a high mortality rate (more than 20%). It is obvious that camel farming systems in the Kingdom are changing progressively, the traditional way of life in desert having to face to urbanization and improvement of the incomes. The tendency to be settled around the town and the highest integration to milk and meat market is increasing as in other camel country  (Faye et al., 2002) . Since the sixties, urban population in Saudi Arabia changed from 20 to 87% whereas in the same time the camel population increased according to FAO statistics (http://www. faostat.org) from 80 thousand to 260 thousand heads (which is widely lower than the probable population estimated to more than 800 thousand by the Ministry of  Agriculture, 2006)  i.e. an annual growth of 5.2%. For the same period (from 1961 and 2008) the official growth of camel milk and meat production was 6.4 and 6.6% respectively indicating an increase of the productivity. This increasing productivity was possible with the intensification of the production  Al-Mutairi et al., 2010)  as it is observed in periurban farming system (improving of the diet, better health management) described in other part of the world  (Faye et al., 2003) . Furthermore, economical survey would be necessary for a better understanding of the economic importance of camel, not only at national level, but also in the incomes for the camel owners (Al-  Khamis and Young, 2006) . The camel farm types in Saudi Arabia are characterized by a wide variability of the total number of camels in the herd. The herd size varied from 1 to more than 800 heads. The camel herd size was higher in farms where owner was living in desert (the mean camel herd size was more than 100 camels in type 1a vs between 56 and 72 in all other types). On average, the camel farms had fewer camels in number within the herd but probably with a higher productivity. The settlement, especially around the town was facilitating the access to health and other services, to inputs and to higher quality food. 
 Conclusion The present typology gave overview of the current situation of camel farming system in some part of KSA (Northern, eastern and Central regions). Without previous similar studies, it is difficult to assess the trajectories of these production systems and to know how the different types of camel farms are still changing. However, the country has known very strong changes since the last decades (improvement of the life level, very high urbanization growth). The national authorities have to pay attention to the current changes in camel farming. The requirements of the camel farmers (in high quality food, health protection, camel product processing, and improvement of the camel product marketing…) are increasing. The services to the farmers have to be adapted to these trends. In our sample, more than the half of the farmers appeared to be multi-active or retired. Further surveys have to be envisaged in order to make a clear diagnosis of the change in the farming system and to deepen also the knowledge on the camel market sector in the country. Even if the camel industry is probably not dominant in the national economy, the investment of many people living in urban areas shows the still high interest of Saudi population to the camel farming. It appears clearly that camel farming is compatible with the modern way of life.

(45) , a highly destructive and widespread bacterial plant pathogen, is surely one of the most successful vascular bacteria. This soilborne xylem inhabitant encompasses thousands of different strains distributed worldwide and causes bacterial wilt disease in more than 50 botanical families  (21) . As a highly genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous plant pathogen species, R. solanacearum is an excellent case for study in order to understand genomic evolution mechanisms in general and plant adaptation in particular. Classification of R. solanacearum has undergone many changes during the past 20 years. Historically, the biodiversity of strains was characterized by the race and biovar system, based on phenotypic traits  (2) (3) (4) . Nevertheless, this classification evolved with the multiple techniques employed to assay genomic differences among closely related bacterial species, strains, or lineages. The new tools developed during the genomics era, combined with phenotypic and geospatial data, allow the assessment of relationships between widely heterogeneous organisms as regards their physiology, ecology, and gene content  (7, 35) . The latest hierarchical classification scheme based on partial sequence analysis resulted in better understanding of the phylogeny within this species complex; classifications were unified into four distinct phylotypes, relating to the geographical origins of strains  (13, 41) . This phylotype classification largely correlates with the geographic origin and evolutionary past of strains  (41) , which are assigned to Asian (phylotype I), American (phylotype II), African (phylotype III), and Indonesian (phylotype IV) phylotypes. Phylotype IV hosts the two closely related species Ralstonia syzygii (the agent of Sumatra disease of clove) and the banana blood disease bacterium (BDB)  (36, 40) . The breakthrough of DNA-based technologies brought new insights into the diversity and evolution of pathogens  (22) , and novel classifications emerged. R. solanacearum is no exception; many studies revisited its diversity at the genus level  (8, 9, 40) , the species complex level  (14, 26, 41) , or the ecological level  (10, 37, 39) . Hence, as a high-throughput alternative to the full sequencing of entire bacterial genomes, the pangenomic comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) microarray developed in this study was designed for fine investigation of the phylogenetic diversity of R. solanacearum. A former study used a CGH microarray approach to estimate the distribution of genes among 18 R. solanacearum strains distributed in the phylogeny  (19) . That microarray was designed from the GMI1000 genome sequence (phylotype I) and encompassed about 5,000 oligonucleotides. Data from the whole genome confirmed the distribution of the phylogeny into four distinct phylotypes and brought a first estimation of the core genome content. However, the design of that CGH microarray was restricted to one phylotype I strain only, inducing a bias against estimating specific genes of the three other phylotypes. On the basis of that study, going one step further, we chose here to develop a pangenomic microarray from available sequenced genomes of six strains, distributed in the phylogeny of R. solanacearum. As a first step, a genomic database was constituted around R. solanacearum, three genomes of which were recently fully sequenced and annotated  (30) , in addition to the three other genomes already available  (18, 31) . In addition to confirming the previous phylotype classification, this work highlighted the remarkable heterogeneity of this bacterial species between phylotypes and the probable need to further reshape its classification into at least three genomic species  (30) . Also, since the ancestral Ralstonia prototype is assumed to be a plant pathogen  (15, 19) , study of the extent of the diversity of this genus, along with the evolutionary pathways involved, is of major importance for a broad understanding of pathogen evolution. We hypothesized that there was much more biodiversity to discover from genomic analysis of phylotype II strains of R. solanacearum, namely, cold-tolerant potato brown rot strains (IIB-1), previously recognized to be clonal after various neutral marker approaches  (5, 27, 34) , tropical Moko disease-causing strains (IIB-4), and emerging strains (IIB-4NPB). We thus focus on phylogenetically closely related phylotype II groups of strains with well-characterized and diverging ecological and phenotypical traits, in an attempt to reconstruct their epidemiological pathways along with the acquisition of their lifestyles. 
 MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains. A set of 72 R. solanacearum strains was selected to cover the known genetic diversity within the R. solanacearum species complex, especially in phylotype II (n ϭ 60) (see  Table S1  in the supplemental material). Pathotypes of strains were previously assessed (5) on genetic resources obtained from potato (Solanum tuberosum), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), eggplant (Solanum melongena), and banana (Musa spp.). Ralstonia pickettii strain LMG5942T was included as an outgroup. Strains were obtained from different bacterial collections maintained at the Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement (CIRAD; Saint Pierre, Réunion Island; Le Lamentin, Martinique, French West Indies), Laboratoire National de la Protection des Végétaux (LNPV; Angers, France), Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA; Rennes, France), University of Queensland (Brisbane, Australia), and Collection Française de Bactéries Phytopathogènes (CFBP; Angers, France). Probe design and microarray manufacture. Biological probes (n ϭ 10,761) were designed from six sequenced and fully annotated genomes of R. solanacearum: GMI1000 (31), Molk2 and IPO1609 (18), CMR15, CFBP2957, and PSI07  (30) . These six genomic sequences are publicly available through the online MaGe interface (https://www.genoscope .cns.fr/agc/microscope/about/collabprojects.php?P_idϭ67). Probe design was performed by Imaxio (Clermont-Ferrand, France) using the following strategy. Two 60-mer probes were designed from each coding sequence (CDS). Three groups of probes, called ""specific,"" ""core,"" or ""variable"" according to their target specificity, were constituted. The ""specific"" group was composed of probes specifically targeting a strain; these probes were encoded as ""CFBP,"" ""CMR,"" ""GMI,"" ""IPO,"" ""MOLK,"" or ""PSI"" depending on the target. The ""core"" group comprised probes targeting all orthologous genes in the six sequenced genomes. Finally, the ""variable"" group was composed of probes targeting genes in at least two, but not all, sequenced genomes. To avoid redundancy on orthologous genes, probe filtering was performed using the BLASTN algorithm (1), based on an 80% minimum match, a melting temperature (T m ) of 77°C Ϯ 9°C, and a GϩC content of 57% Ϯ 20% (see  Fig. S1  in the supplemental material). Hence, only one probe was designed per CDS or among orthologous CDSs. Microarrays were manufactured by Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA) using in situ synthesis. The final set of probes, randomly implemented on the array surface, was composed of 3,317 ""core,"" 3,631 ""variable,"" and 3,963 ""specific"" probes. Hybridization quality and interslide reproducibility were assessed with 10 replicates of 300 biological probes: 275 ""core"" group and 25 ""variable"" group probes, along with the microarray manufacturer controls. Negative controls were also added, with 35 probes designed to target the close relative Cupriavidus taiwanensis and 7 random-sequence-based probes designed to be noncomplementary with any sequenced R. solanacearum genomes. DNA labeling and hybridization. Overnight liquid cultures were pelleted at 5,400 rpm and were washed with 500 ml of 1 M NaCl before genomic DNA was purified by using a DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Genomic DNA was labeled with using Cy3 or Cy5 dye, according to the method of Guidot et al.  (19) . Labeled products were purified by using a CyScribe GFX purification kit (GE Healthcare, Bucks, United Kingdom) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. DNA was adjusted at a concentration of 70 ng · l Ϫ1 in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade water using a NanoDrop 8000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE), for an average dye labeling concentration of 12 pmol · liter Ϫ1 . Hybridizations were done overnight (for approximately 16 h) in the G2545A microarray hybridization oven (Agilent Technologies) by following the 8ϫ15K Custom CGH microarray protocol from Agilent Technologies (reference G4410-90010). Hybridizations of the six sequenced genomes were repeated three times to assess interslide reproducibility, and strain CMR15 genomic DNA labeled with Cy5 was included in each hybridization as a reference for further reproducibility tests. Hybridizations of the other strains were not repeated to verify reproducibility (see Results). Image scanning and data analysis. Slides were scanned at a 5-m resolution using the G2565CA scanner managed by Scan Control software, version 8.5 (Agilent Technologies). Data were extracted from the 16-bit tagged-image format file (TIFF) image with Feature Extraction software, version 10.5.1.1 (Agilent Technologies). Data manipulation and statistical analysis were performed with the free statistical software R, version 2.11.1  (29) . Spot intensities were calculated as the difference between the median foreground and background intensities, normalized according to the standard normal deviation method, along with a base 2 logarithm. The dispersion of the mass distribution was assessed using a kernel density method with a Gaussian kernel  (32, 33) . To distinguish between the positive and negative responses, a response threshold was estimated independently for each hybridization as the intensity value of the minimum density between the two peaks of the spot distribution. This response threshold allowed us to estimate two responses of probes based on their binary signals: a signal of 1 represented the presence of a gene, and a signal of zero represented its absence. All further analyses were performed on this binary data set. Phylogeny and population structure reconstruction. The phylogeny of R. solanacearum was reconstructed using MrBayes, version 3.2, with the binary evolution model implemented in and allowing for variation of substitution rates among sites. Two runs with four Markov chains were conducted simultaneously for 3,000,000 generations starting from random initial trees, sampled every 500 generations. Variations in the maximum-likelihood (ML) scores for these samples were examined graphically with Tracer, version 1.5 (A. Rambaut and A. J. Drummond, 2007; http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Tracer). After discarding of the trees generated prior to the stabilization of ML scores (burn in, 10%), the consensus phylogeny and posterior probability of the nodes were determined. Trees were edited using FigTree, version 1.3.1 (A. Rambaut, 2007; http: //tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). Population structure was estimated using STRUCTURE, version 2.3.3  (28) . This iterative-model-based analysis aimed to assess the population structure with the assignment of individuals to ""K"" clusters, allowing for admixture. To infer the number of groups, a fully Bayesian process  (28)  was run with different values for the number of clusters (K). Analysis lengths were set to a burning period of 50,000 iterations followed by 100,000 iterations of simulation. A total of 20 independent simulations were performed, with K ranging from 1 to 10. STRUCTURE would attri-bute a probability, Pr(X|K) given the data (X), and the log Pr(X|K) was used to determine the more likely number of clusters by following the method described by Evanno et al.  (11) . STRUCTURE software also gives the assignment probabilities of each individual for each cluster, and we then inferred the most probable groups for each individual. 
 RESULTS 
 Microarray validation. The specificity and sensitivity of the pangenomic CGH microarray were estimated through the gene content by comparing results from the genome sequences and microarray probing. First, all probes designed as negative controls were always given a negative response. The data showed that more than 98.1% of the genes found by the sequencing of the six reference strains were retrieved by the pangenomic microarray, but 1.9% of probe responses could be considered false-negative responses. The proportion of false-positive probes was estimated to be lower than 4.8% and corresponded to positive probes matching a genome different from that for which they were designed. The reproducibility of microarray hybridizations was assessed using the replicated probes, including the 300 replicated probes on each array, which showed an interslide reproducibility of 97.6%, and the 85 replicated CMR15 (III-29) strains labeled with Cy5, which showed an interslide reproducibility of 93.4% and an intraslide reproducibility of 99.6% on the same array. Comparison of the 3 replicates of Cy3-labeled CMR15 with the 3 replicates of Cy5-labeled CMR15 showed a reproducibility of 96.7%. Depletion curves  (Fig. 1 ) represent the relation between the number of strains hybridized on the pangenomic array and the number of positive probes. Curves were computed and plotted for all R. solanacearum strains (black curve) and phylotype IIB strains (blue curve). In both curves, after a massive decrease in the number of positive probe responses for the first 10 strains sampled, the number of positive probes tended to stabilize with an increasing number of strains tested and reached a plateau at 2,690 probes for all strains and 4,228 probes for the IIB strains. The array core probes (ArCP) revealed by the pangenomic microarray represented 24.7% (n ϭ 2,690) of the biological probes and targeted mainly chromosomal genes (83.0%). By focusing on the minimal gene set described by  Gil et al. (16) , which includes well-conserved housekeeping genes for basic metabolism and macromolecular synthesis, 199 out of 205 genes were found to be targeted by at least one probe from the ArCP group. Phylogeny in the Ralstonia solanacearum species complex. Phylogenetic reconstruction showed with high statistical support that strains are distributed into three major clusters and many subdivisions, reflecting the revised scheme for division into phylotypes and sequevars (30)  (Fig. 2A) . All the phylotypes were characterized as monophyletic in the tree, and all replicated hybridizations were clustered together. R. pickettii strain LMG5942T clearly constituted an outlier from the R. solanacearum species complex and was assigned as an outgroup. At the phylotype level, three distinct clusters were described: phylotype IV on one side, phylotypes I and III grouping together, and phylotype II constituting the last cluster. A closer look within phylotypes reveals, with high statistical support, that three strains clearly constituted outliers from their sequevars: strain CMR15 (III-29), strain CFBP6797 (IIB-4NPB), and strain CFBP3858 (IIB-1). Reconstruction of the population structure, performed with STRUCTURE software, also revealed three clusters  (Fig. 2B, part 1 ) but grouped phylotypes I, III, and IV together in a first cluster (blue bars), phylotypes IIB-1 and IIB-2 in a second cluster (red bar), and the other sequevars in a last cluster (green bar). The analysis also revealed admixed signatures of individuals (i.e., their interbreed origins) by showing a mixed proportion of estimated membership probability for at least two groups. The two strains CFBP3858 (IIB-1) and IBSBF1712 (IIB-27) displayed this hybrid profile between the second cluster, to which they belong, and the third cluster, composed of other phylotype II strains. Phylotype IIA strains also showed signatures with the three clusters admixed. Phylogeny of brown rot strains. The diversity and structure of ecological groups, such as brown rot-and Moko disease-causing strains, were further investigated using the same approach. Brown rot strains were distributed into sequevars 1 and 2 (  Fig. 2A ;  Table  1 ), which are both monophyletic. Analysis revealed a first partition into two groups, where sequevar 2 strains grouped with sequevar 1 strains  (Table 1 ;  Fig. 2B , part 2, top box, yellow bars). Those strains originated mainly in the Andean region. The other cluster, composed only of sequevar 1 strains  (Fig. 2B, part 2 , top box, red bars), was found to be subdivided into at least five clusters reflecting their geographical areas of isolation (  2B, part 2, bottom box), where phylotype IIB-3 strains constituted a first cluster (blue bars); phylotype IIB-4, IIB-4NPB, and IIB-51 strains constituted a second cluster (green bars); and phylotype IIA strains constituted a third cluster (purple bars). Focusing on the second cluster revealed a partition into three groups  (Table 2 ;  Fig. 2B, part 3, bottom box) , where Moko disease-causing strains from sequevar 4 constituted a first cluster (yellow bars), distinct from emerging strains from sequevar 4NPB, grouped into a second cluster (green bar). Finally, strains UW162 (IIB-4), CFBP6797 (IIB-4NPB), and CFBP7014 (IIB-51) constituted a third cluster  (Fig. 2B, part 3 , bottom box, purple bars). Surprisingly, the Moko disease-causing sequevar 4 was split into two groups: strains UW162, UW163, and UW170 ( Comparative genomic hybridizations. Analysis of the gene content revealed by the pangenomic microarray highlighted differences among phylotype II ecotypes, but no gene repertories were found to be associated with the pathogenicity traits of the different ecotypes. Nonetheless, two particular groups of genes were observed. A zonula occludens toxin that increases cell permeability, leading to the disassembly of intercellular tight junctions, was found in every brown rot strain from phylotype IB-1. This toxin gene was also found in strains CMR15 (III-29) and K60 (IIA-7). A total of three out of eight genes of the rhi-type antimitotic toxin operon were found in every emerging strain from phy-  
 DISCUSSION Exploration of the diversity within almost clonal strains of R. solanacearum was necessary in order to understand their relationships and the evolutionary mechanisms that shaped this successful plant pathogen. Hence, we analyzed the relationships of the 72 R. solanacearum strains, along with R. pickettii strain LMG5942T as the outgroup strain, using statistical methods for phylogeny reconstruction and population structure inference. It is important here to point out one of the particular features of this second analysis. The STRUCTURE software aims to infer groups of individuals that are under the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and linkage equilibrium. While this assumption seems clearly valid for phylotypes I, III, and IV, concerns can be raised regarding phylo-type II. This phylotype was recently estimated to be partly clonal, which may induce a bias into the population structure inference. The effect of complete population clonality would be that the inferred clustering of individuals would reflect subdivisions of the diversity, as a tree would do, rather than actual populations  (12, 24) . It remains difficult to estimate the degree of disruption caused in our inference, and one must be cautious when interpreting those particular results. Unsurprisingly, major divisions and subdivisions of the phylogeny were congruent with the revised phylotype/sequevar scheme obtained from genome analysis and with previous CGH microarray or genomic data analyses  (19, 30, 44)  that support the subdivision of the R. solanacearum species complex into three different groups: phylotypes I and III, phylotype II, and phylotype IV. In the population structure analysis, phylotype IV appeared to be associated with phylotypes I and III, while phylotype II was divided into two groups. This result was quite surprising in that a a Determined by sequencing of the partial endoglucanase (egl) gene  (13) . b Cluster determined from the phylogenetic reconstruction performed using MrBayes, version 3.2  (Fig. 2) . Designations reflect the main origin of strains within each cluster: AIO, African-Indian Ocean regions; EuMr, European and Mediterranean regions; North, Northern European region; Andean, Latin American region. ""Out"" refers to the outer phylogenetic position of the strain compared to its sequevar. c Statistical groups were obtained by a Bayesian population structure assessment analysis with STRUCTURE software for numbers of clusters (K) ranging from 1 to 10. The major population was assessed as having 2 clusters, according to the likelihood of assignment decreasing from a ⌬K value of 74 for 1 cluster to 1.44 for 6 clusters. Cluster 1 was assigned with an average inference of 0.872, and cluster 2 was assigned with an average inference of 0.799. The subpopulation was assessed as having 4 clusters, according to the likelihood of assignment increasing from a ⌬K value of 11.210 for 1 cluster to 25.814 for 3 clusters, and then decreasing until K reached a value of 10. Subcluster A was assigned with an average inference of 0.837; subcluster B, with an average inference of 0.576; subcluster C, with an average inference of 0.554; and subcluster D, with an average inference of 0.693. ND, not done. separation between phylotypes I and III, on the one hand, and phylotype IV, on the other hand, was expected. In fact, phylotype IV presents some admixed signals until K reaches 5, when phylotype IV splits from phylotypes I and III (data not shown). Topologies were also congruent regardless of the data set targeted by the probes used: the whole genome, the chromosome (see  Fig. S2  in the supplemental material), the megaplasmid (see  Fig.  S3 ), and type III effectors (see  Fig. S4 ) or, more generally, genes recognized to be involved into pathogenicity (see  Fig. S5 ). This is consistent with the hypothesis of a long coevolution of the two replicons  (6, 15, 19)  and the ancestral character of R. solanacearum as a plant pathogen  (15) . Finally, the results confirmed the main repartition of core genes on the chromosome  (19, 30, 31) , but no major gene repertories explained the known phylogeny of R. solanacearum, other than the zonula occludens toxin in brown rot IIB-1 strains and the rhi-type toxin operon in emerging IIB-4NPB strains. This suggests, rather than a gene content difference, a finetuning of gene expression and regulation; nonetheless, many genes were associated with unknown and uncharacterized proteins. Brown rot ecotype strains. The pangenomic microarray approach developed in this study was successful in distinguishing between phylogenetic positions relative to brown rot strains from phylotype IIB-1, Moko disease-causing strains from phylotype IIB-4, and emerging strains from phylotype IIB-4NPB. The investigation first focused on cold-tolerant phylotype IIB-1 strains, which represent a serious threat for potato production in Europe and temperate regions of the world. These strains were formerly known to present a clonal structure  (20, 23, 27, 38) , and considerable diversity associated with the geographical distribution of strains was inferred in this study. Analysis showed two major clusters, but surprisingly, whereas the inference of phylogeny reflected a separation between sequevar 1 and 2 strains (phylotype II), the Bayesian population structure assessment method grouped strains from the Andean region together. Since the potato (S. tuberosum) originated in the highlands of Central America, this finding suggests a common evolutionary past for brown rot IIB-1 and IIB-2 strains, before their evolution as two distinct phylogenetic clusters. Strains in this ""Andean"" cluster could be referred to as the Andean brown rot strains, distinct from the 20 other strains Major cluster Subcluster constituting the other major cluster in phylotype IIB-1. However, strains CFBP3873 (Belgium) and CFBP4808 (Israel), assigned to this ""Andean"" cluster, displayed high levels of membership in both of those clusters, suggesting a hybrid profile and close paths of evolution. A focus on the major cluster composed only of phylotype IIB-1 strains revealed at least four subclusters correlated with the geographical origins of strains and named after these locations. The group names must nevertheless be taken with caution, since the location of isolation may not represent the real center of origin. A first cluster, named ""EuMr,"" contained strains mainly originating from Europe and the Mediterranean and was phylogenetically heterogeneous, partitioning into two structure clusters: B and C. The hybrid profile revealed by the estimated membership probability values among strains from clusters B and C and among strains within each cluster suggests high gene flows between those two populations. To our knowledge, assignment of strain PSS525, isolated in Taiwan from potato, to the European cluster B supports the hypothesis of its introduction into Taiwan through Pelargonium material (P. Prior, unpublished data; J.-F. Wang, personal communication). Similarly, it is anticipated that strain JQ1006, isolated from wilted potato in Réunion Island, may also have been introduced, since it also belongs to the European cluster B. Such data provide epidemiological evidence of the introduction and spread of strains across countries, supposedly carried by infected material. Whereas European strains were previously described as heterogeneous, the AIO phylogenetic cluster, comprising strains with a geographical origin mainly in Africa or the Indian Ocean, was consistent with structure cluster A and was characterized by a high estimated membership. We could then hypothesize that those strains were exposed to limited gene flow and may be characterized as endemic to the African and Indian Ocean regions, since they were limited to these regions. However, three strains present with possible gene flow events between the endemic African brown rot strains and European strains. Strains CFBP3865 (isolated in France from potato), CFBP3785 (Portugal, potato), and CFBP4812 (France, tomato) were assigned to the EuMr phylogenetic cluster but also to the African structure cluster, showing a hybrid profile with a European structure cluster. This suggests that these strains carry a hybrid profile between African-Indian Ocean and European populations and thus may represent a bridge between these two major brown rot subclusters. Hence, two distinct events may explain the diversity of brown rot strains observed in Europe: a former Andean origin that may have spread worldwide along with a massive movement of potato material and a more recent African-Indian Ocean origin. The African lineage for brown rot strains is thus of major interest as a model for studying microevolution events at a continental level. The last subcluster found within the brown rot strains from phylotype I was referred to as the ""North"" phylogenetic cluster and structure cluster D, corresponding to strains isolated in Netherlands and Sweden. The reference strain IPO1609 was isolated by Janse in 1995, and strain CFBP3884 was isolated by Ollson and received by Janse in 1980 (J. Janse, personal communication). As revealed by the pangenomic microarray, these two strains were clearly distinct from other IIB-1 clusters. Strain IPO1609 was recently reported to carry a 77-kb DNA deletion (17) compared to other R. solanacearum genomes, especially IIB-1 strain UW551. This chromosomal region included 43 genes, from which 2 en-coded proteins related to pathogenicity traits. The high similarity between IPO1609 and CFBP3884 and the negative probe signal targeting this particular 68-kb region (confirmed by replicates [data not shown]) strongly indicate that this deletion is present in both strains. This deletion event should not be considered an exception in R. solanacearum strains. Both strains IPO1609 and CFBP3884 are nonpathogenic to potato  (5) , and IPO1609 was proved to show limited aggressiveness to Solanaceae  (25) . A strain UW551 mutant with this large DNA fragment deleted showed a dramatic reduction of virulence  (17) . This particular deletion was not the only difference in gene content between the ""North"" phylogenetic cluster and those distributed in structure clusters A and B; the microarray data flagged at least 91 additional genes, 8 of which were reported to be related to pathogenicity. Nevertheless, the lack of pathogenicity for potato and the generally low virulence traits of strains IPO1609 and CFBP3884 remain to be further investigated. Moko disease-causing strains. Insect-transmitted and Moko disease-causing strains that were distributed into phylotypes IIA-6, IIB-3, and IIB-4 are devastating to banana production. A major phylogenetic issue was that Moko IIB-4 strains were phylogenetically undistinguishable from emergent strains and new pathological variants assigned to IIB-4NPB by use of a neutral marker approach or partial egl sequencing. These emerging strains were surveyed in the French West Indies  (42)  and clustered with the Moko sequevar 4 strains, though they showed a completely different host range: they were highly pathogenic to Solanaceae, along with brown rot phylotype IIB-1 strains (5), but nonpathogenic to banana (NPB). This study resolved that disputed phylogenetic position, since the microarray data clearly showed distinct lineages. However, Moko IIB-4 strains were distributed into two phylogenetic clusters, 4A and 4B; cluster 4A is closely related to the emerging IIB-4NPB strains, in contrast to cluster 4B. Although emerging strains and Moko disease-causing sequevar 4 strains showed a close phylogenetic relationship, it is difficult to explain how virulence traits evolved over time among those two ecotypes. Emerging strains from sequevar 4NPB are not pathogenic to banana and are highly aggressive on Solanaceae, whereas all Moko IIB-4 strains are highly pathogenic to banana, and some retained pathogenicity to Solanaceae and could overcome genetic resistance resources  (5) . These data are consistent with the assumption that strains IIB-4NPB emerged from the IIB-4 lineage as a new ecotype  (43) . This hypothesis suggests that a loss of particular pathogenicity traits could trigger an emergence of highly host adapted strains. The phylogenetic position of strain CFBP6797 (4NPB) outside the emerging cluster, but within cluster 4B, confirms the close relationship between the Moko strains and the emerging ecotypes. The particular phylogenetic status of strain CFBP7014, of the newly described sequevar 51, is also a matter of interest, since this sequevar differed phylogenetically from Moko disease-causing strains and emergent strains. Strain CFBP7014, previously characterized as sequevar 4NPB by PCR  (42) , was assigned as a close outlier of 4NPB sequevars. This strain was shown to be highly pathogenic on sensitive Solanaceae and could establish latent infections on resistant Solanaceae but did not penetrate into banana plant tissues  (5) . Thus, like sequevar 4NPB strains in the French West Indies, strain CFBP7014 might be considered an emergent pathological variant in Trinidad. Combining the natural competence of R. solanacearum for transformation and its wide phylogenetic diversity, it is easier to understand the success of R. solanacearum in extending its host range, its phenotype diversity, and its geographical distribution. Gene content explains the phylogenetic diversity, but not the pathogenic profile: a study focusing on gene expression and on fine-tuning of alleles within the pangenome should be carried out. Accessing those data by questioning the full genome content on a large strain collection remains problematic; nevertheless, the use of the pangenomic microarray developed in this study provides a resolution never before reached for R. solanacearum diversity studies. This study brought new insights into aspects of the diversity of R. solanacearum, especially with regard to the epidemiology of three ecotypes within phylotype II of this plant pathogen: brown rot-causing strains, Moko disease-causing strains, and emerging strains. However, more research needs to be done on the evolutionary past in order to fully understand the relationships of ecotypes and phylotypes. FIG 1 1 Depletion curves of the core probe set. The depletion of the core probe set was analyzed for phylotype IIB strains (n ϭ 59) (blue whisker plots) and for the four Ralstonia solanacearum phylotypes (n ϭ 85) (black whisker plots). Each whisker plot represents the distribution of the number of positive probes for a strain of the tested group (size given on the horizontal axis) after 100 resamplings.

Within an analysis, each solid bar represents the proportions of ancestral nucleotides inherited from each of the inferred ancestral populations.lotype IIB-4NPB. Variable numbers of genes in this operon were found in phylotype IIB-4 and IIA strains PSI07 (IV-10), CFBP3059 (III-23), and DGBBC1138 (III-43). 
 Table 1 ; 1 Fig. 2B, part 3, top box). One group was associated with the African and Indian Ocean regions (Table 1, subcluster A; Fig. 2B, part 3, top box, red bars); two groups were associated with the European and Mediterranean regions (Table 1, subclusters B and C; Fig. 2B, part 3, top box, green and blue bars); and one group was associated with Northern Europe (Table 1, subcluster D; Fig. 2B, part 3, top box, orange bars).Moko disease-causing strains and phylogeny of emerging strains. Moko disease-causing strains are partitioned into phylotypes IIA-6, IIB-3, and IIB-4; thus, this ecotype is not considered monophyletic. Analysis of this ecotype, along with emergent strains from phylotype IIB-4NPB and IIB-51, and other phylotype IIA strains, revealed a partition into three clusters (Table 2; Fig. 
 Table 2 , 2 phylogeny 4A) were phylogenetically closer to the emerging sequevar 4NPB than the other sequevar 4 strains (Table 2, phylogeny 4B).

This may be due to the impact of changes in mean temperature or rainfall  6  , and has been illustrated through statistical evaluation of pathogen dynamic trends and shifts in climatic factors  7, 8  . Climate variability may also affect outbreaks of infectious diseases  9  . Increase in the transmission of different vector-borne diseases such as Murray Valley encephalitis, bluetongue, Rift Valley fever, African horse sickness, Ross River virus disease, visceral leishmaniasis, dengue and malaria  6, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21]  have been linked to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO, an intermittent inversion of Pacific Ocean thermal gradients) driven climate anomalies  22, 23  . Associations with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), another index of climate variability, have also been investigated for several other infectious diseases including Lyme borreliosis  24  , tularaemia  25  , and measles  26  . Although climate change is a global phenomenon, its effects vary by location, making regional studies of potential impacts important. In Europe, several studies have provided important insights into the consequences of climate change on infectious diseases and evidence for resulting epidemiological changes in individual diseases, such as bluetongue  27  . However, few studies have taken a comparative approach considering effects upon multiple diseases together  28, 29  , and even fewer have explored the potential links between climate variability and disease outbreaks in Europe as an entity  30  . While the ENSO index does not seem to be an accurate index of climate variability in Europe, the NAO does  31, 32  . Positive and negative phases of the NAO reflect patterns of pressure anomalies and are associated with changes in temperature and precipitation patterns extending from eastern North America to western and central Europe. Strong positive phases of the NAO tend to be associated with above-average temperatures and precipitation across northern and central Europe, and above-average temperatures and below-average precipitation over Mediterranean countries (Southern Europe, North African and Middle-Eastern countries). Opposite patterns of temperature and precipitation abnormalities are typically observed during strong negative phases of the NAO (www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov). However, this pattern seems to be more pronounced in winter and climate variability in Mediterranean countries appears to also be linked to the Indian Monsoon  33  . Research covering Europe is limited compared, for example, to the USA. The association between the NAO and the annual incidence rate of 13 viral, bacterial, and protozoan human diseases in the Czech Republic from 1951 to 2003 was investigated by Hubálek  30  . According to his analyses, toxoplasmosis and infectious mononucleosis were significantly and positively correlated and leptospirosis was negatively correlated with the NAO. For toxoplas-mosis, it was proposed that the warmer winter associated with a positive NAO, lagged one year (meaning it occurred one year later), would enhance populations of rodents, the intermediate hosts of the protist Toxoplasma gondii. For leptospirosis, higher precipitation in negative NAO years, lagged two years, would result in increasing populations of field rodents, the main reservoir of the bacteria Leptospira interrogans  30  . A similar conclusion was reached for hantavirus outbreaks in the USA in relation to El Niño (ENSO), with heavy rains or warm winters boosting mast seeding and thus favouring rodent populations, the reservoirs of hantavirus  34  . Similar associations were also found for hantavirus in Belgium  35  . This study aimed to test the influence of NAO variability upon outbreak occurrences of several infectious diseases across Europe observed over recent decades. Interpretation of the results would also need to consider that non-climate related factors such as an increase in disease reporting over time may be important contributors to observed disease trends. 
 Results For eleven diseases, the occurrence of outbreaks was significantly related to the NAO monthly index. These include adenovirus infection, measles, Q fever, Aseptic viral meningitis, enterovirus infection, gastroenteritis, typhoid fever, tularaemia, hantavirus infection, hepatitis A, and shigellosis. A twelfth disease, trichinosis, was associated with the NAO monthly index at a 94% level of statistical certainty. The remaining disease, tuberculosis, was not associated with NAO monthly index. Mean health expenditure was significantly associated with year (  Fig. 1C ) (Adjusted R 2 5 0.967, F 1,47 5 1390, P 5 0.00001), as was per capita GDP (Adjusted R 2 5 0.995, F 1,47 5 9254, P , 0.00001). Per capita GDP and per capita health expenditure across European countries were significantly correlated (Adjusted R 2 5 0.9598, F 1,47 5 1148, P , 0.00001). We treat per capita health expenditure as a proxy for the effectiveness of surveillance reporting. We used Generalized Linear Modelling (GLM) to model the association of monthly NAO on the number of outbreaks using smoothed spline fitting function. The best model was selected using the AIC criterion for each infectious disease (ID) studied, given in  Table 2 . Of the diseases found to be associated with NAO indices, seven (adenovirus infection, measles, Aseptic viral meningitis, Q fever, gastroenteritis, tularaemia, shigellosis and trichinosis) were associated with the winter positive phases in northern Europe (from November to February), therefore with above-average temperatures and above-average precipitation. Two diseases were associated with negative NAO at other times of year: enterovirus infection showed an association with the negative summer NAO index in northern Europe; and hantavirus infection was associated with the negative spring NAO index in northern Europe. Typhoid fever showed an association with positive winter NAO index in southern Europe, which corresponds to below-average temperature and below-average precipitation. Hepatitis A showed an association with negative winter NAO index in southern Europe with above-average temperatures and above-average precipitation. 
 Discussion For the majority of the diseases, the detrended number of outbreaks was significantly related to the positive autumn and winter NAO monthly index values in southern countries, or to the negative autumn and winter NAO monthly index values in southern countries. The observed differences in results between northern and southern Europe are in accord with the differential influences of the NAO on Europe, particularly in winter  31  , although climate variability in Mediterranean countries is also influenced by the Indian monsoon  33  . Associations between the occurrence of different infectious diseases and climate variables have been reported worldwide. Evidence of changes in influenza risk attributable to climate variability comes from Choi et al.  49  , who found a lower mortality risk due to influenza during El Niño events compared to periods of normal weather. Sultan et al.  50  showed that climate variability can also affect the occurrence of meningococcal meningitis, with a correlation found between the onset of meningococcal meningitis epidemics and the winter maximum of an atmospheric index. In this study, outbreaks of adenovirus infection were associated with positive values of the NAO, which is consistent with other findings in the literature, in which increased precipitation has been reported as boosting the risk of adenovirus infection  39  . The study also found associations between Q fever and measles with positive values of summer NAO, which are in accordance with previous observations at country level for Q fever in the Netherlands 41 and measles in England and Wales  26  . We found three water-borne diseases (enterovirus infection, viral gastroenteritis and shigellosis) were associated with the positive  summer values of the NAO index in northern Europe (wet climate), whereas typhoid fever was correlated with negative values of the NAO in northern Europe and the positive values of the NAO in southern Europe (dry climate). This confirms previous work suggesting that water-borne diseases are affected by climate variability; more specifically heavy rainfall events affecting enterovirus infection in arid tropical regions  43  , and periods of high temperature affecting viral gastroenteritis  44  and typhoid fever  (Table 1) . Further, bacillary dysentery has previously been shown to be affected by climate variations and particularly El Niño 51 . Hantavirus outbreaks in northern Europe were associated with a negative spring NAO with two years lag, which is in agreement with the findings of Tersagoa et al.  35  in Belgium. Heavy rains or warm winters and springs boost mast seeding and, with a certain time lag, favour rodent populations as reservoirs of hantavirus. Palo et al.  52  showed that negative values of the NAO index were associated with high numbers of human cases of tularaemia in Sweden. Epidemiological investigations of summer outbreaks of tularemia in two localities in Sweden showed complex associations with landscape changes (wetland restoration) and recreational activities  53  . We found the same pattern in our analysis, however at the level of all northern European countries. Warmer temperatures have been hypothesized to increase the number of amplification cycles for food animal parasites such as Trichinella species, which may explain the positive association between the winter NAO phase and trichinosis outbreaks in northern Europe. An alternative explanation might be that these climatic conditions would lead to longer summer hunting seasons and consequently to an increased exposure of humans to the pathogens  54  . The same may also apply to tulaeremia. However, in Europe, most trichinosis infections are associated with wild boar being eaten undercooked and any association with climatic parameters should be evaluated whilst also taking account consumer behaviour. Climate variability may have a direct impact on pathogens via effects on survival outside of the host, and dissemination. Climate variability may also act indirectly, by acting on other factors which affect the chances of transmission, such as changes in social behaviour, as mentioned above for measles. As emphasized by Randolph  55  and Evengard & Sauerborn 56 , any increase in disease occurrence can be due to multiple factors. The factors that are most important are not always easy to determine. For infectious mononucleosis for example, which is caused by EB herpesvirus and spreads from person to person by an oropharyngeal route, increasing ambient temperatures are thought to encourage higher than normal outdoor activity and social interactions 30 , which may then increase virus transmission. Similarly, the range of diseases encompassed in this study is likely to be affected by multiple factors, amongst which any NAO variation may act directly on the pathogen or indirectly on the transmission cycle. Our findings confirm that NAO conditions could have significant implications for European public health. The statistical influences of NAO conditions on outbreak occurrence concern all types of transmission routes: air-borne, water-borne, vector-borne and food-borne. We also showed that increases in outbreak occurrences over the last 50 years for all the diseases investigated are largely related to improvements in disease detection and therefore better reporting. Alternative explanations for the increase are factors linked to disease (re)emergence, increasing urbanization, or immigration from endemic countries  42  , none of them have not been accounted for within this study. For a given disease, a threshold above which policy measures would be engaged could be defined taking into account the economic impact of outbreak occurrence for example. Our results suggest that NAO index may be useful for an early warning system (EWS) at the European regional level, although addition analyses on a selection of highly climatesensitive diseases should be undertaken. 
 Methods Disease outbreaks. Data on 2,058 outbreaks from 114 epidemic infectious diseases (ID) which occurred in 36 countries during the period 1950 to 2009 were extracted from the Global Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology Network (GIDEON) database (www.gideononline.com). A disease outbreak was defined in GIDEON, following the definition of the World Health Organization, as the occurrence of cases of disease in excess of what would normally be expected in a defined community within the current study. GIDEON is a medical database that provides continually updated data on the regional presence and epidemic status of pathogens and it has been used in various recent studies  [36] [37] [38]  . Records are updated in the GIDEON database using various sources such as WHO and Promed. A subset of 13 infectious diseases was subsequently selected from GIDEON  (Table 1) , based on whether they had been detected since the early to mid-1950s, and thus sufficient data with which to undertake statistical analysis (i.e. from 1950 to 2009). Health expenditure was added as a confounding variable to describe any increase in spending on health with time, and a likely intensification in surveillance detection and outbreak reporting. This information was obtained from the Total Economy Database (www.conference-board.org/data/economydatabase/). TED was developed by the Groningen Growth and Development Centre at the University of Groningen (The Netherlands). The aggregated per capita GDP for Europe were used. Per capita health expenditure was obtained from the OECD (http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/, http://www.cesifo-group.de). Data on GDP, health expenditure and diseases was acquired for 36 countries. The number of reported outbreaks of infectious diseases increased from 1950 to 2008 in Europe, as did the number of European countries presenting at least one outbreak of the diseases investigated (  Fig. 1A and B ). There were marked increasing trends in both the number of outbreaks and number of countries with outbreaks occurring since the early 1960s as well as an increase in health expenditure  (Fig. 1C)  Statistical analysis. In order to minimize any confounding influence of increased surveillance within some countries, which is likely to be related to health expenditure, we used a cubic smoothing spline as a detrending method for the long-term series of outbreaks using the function smooth.spline in the R 2.10 statistical package (http:// www.R-project.org). The residuals of the trend were calculated by subtracting the value of the trend line from the original value. We performed Generalized Linear Modelling (GLM) using R 2.10 49 to identify the likely variables that may explain outbreaks (using detrended values) for each of the selected infectious diseases (ID). Each monthly NAO of the year or of the previous year (one year lag) was included in the model. Best models were selected using a backward-stepwise procedure with reduction in the AIC criterion and Bonferonni corrections were applied due to the use of multiple tests. Analyses were undertaken respectively for northern and southern European countries in order to take into account the differential influences of the NAO on European regions (www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov).

These communities experience problems of inadequate farming knowledge and skills, and insufficient implements and inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides. In general, soil fertility management is poor and climatic conditions are unpredictable and in most cases very extreme. Consequently these factors force smallholder farmers to engage in resource mining activities to earn a living. Conservation agriculture (CA) and agro-ecology (AE) emerged as response strategies to increase food supply with a sustainable environmental protection  (Fowler et al., 2001; Hobbs, 2007; Derpsch, 2005  Although the promotion of CA in Southern Africa started many years ago this slowed down with advent of western oriented agronomic technologies and practices  (Fowler et al., 2001; Pretty, 2000) . Conservation agriculture and other agricultural practices based on indigenous knowledge and practices are of late gaining support of many agronomists and researchers  (Kassie et al., 2009) . The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), government ministries, non-governmental organization and national and international research institutes have been making conceited efforts to promote CA in Southern Africa since the mid 1980s  (FAO, 2001) . These efforts hinged on the successful implementation of CA technology in South American countries under similar climatic conditions as those of Southern Africa as well as many others in other parts of the world  (Gowing et al., 2008; Giller et al., 2009) . The promotion of CA in Southern Africa has largely ignored unique socioeconomic conditions of farmers in the region; a factor that requires a different approach to what happened in Brazil and Argentina  (Altieri, 1999) . Scientists have been cautioned against promoting CA as a panacea to agricultural challenges associated with poor performance in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and that a critical analysis of CA's potential in the region has been missed  (Giller et al., 2009) .  Mazvimavi et al. (2009)  further argue that lack of published studies on adoption of CA leads to wrong conclusions on how farmers in Southern Africa received technologies. 
 Rationale There are various studies that concentrate on adoption, productivity, energy savings and other benefits of CA yet there are only a few that attempt to explore the link between CA and livelihoods. This paper sets out to do the latter. The paper discusses CA and possible challenges in using CA as a vehicle towards better livelihoods for smallholder farmers in Southern Africa. Livelihood outcomes such as changes in household incomes, vulnerability, food security and welfare of smallholder farmers as outlined in the sustainable livelihoods framework  (Cahn, 2003)  are discussed in this paper. 
 METHODS The paper is a meta-analytical review of 5 books, 16 journal articles, 7 bulletins, 5 conference papers, 4 unpublished research reports, 2 discussion and 3 working papers, 2 PhD theses and some grey literature. The authors' own experiences with CA from various countries in the region have also been used in this paper. The major focus of reviewed articles is broad concepts of CA and livelihoods in Southern Africa.  Table 1  is a summary of various data sources used in the paper. 
 The framework The sustainable livelihoods framework (SLF) in  Figure 1  shows the relationship between resource endowments, livelihood assets, transforming structures/processes and livelihood outcomes  (Cahn, 2003) . For a detailed discussion on the SLF, see  Chambers and Conway (1992) . In this paper we analyze enabling factors required for positive livelihood transformations through CA given evidence from developing countries as demonstrated in studies by  Lautze (1997)  and  Scoones (1998)  in their application of the SLF. Despite the widespread adoption and discussion of the SLF establishment a clear link between agricultural technology and desired livelihood outcomes particularly in the context of Southern Africa has been missed. Many studies concentrate on critical analysis of either SLF or technology adoption. In the other sections we discuss and propose the missing link between CA and livelihoods of smallholder farmers in Southern Africa, but first we define key concepts of livelihoods, CA and adoption that are core in our discussion. 
 What are livelihoods? According to  Chambers and Conway (1992) , livelihoods comprise people, their capabilities, means of earning a living, including food, income and assets. Sustainable livelihoods are those that can cope and recover from stresses and shocks, maintain and enhance local and global assets, on which livelihoods depend, imparting bequests and opportunities for future generations  (Carney, 2002) . Shocks are sudden changes or disturbances in the economy which transform into trends or cycles when the events are prolonged or analyzed over time. Integrating expectations of future generations in today's decision making processes is necessary for the achievement of sustainable livelihoods.  Niehof (2004)  singles out failure to identify sources of livelihoods as one of the weaknesses of this definition of sustainable livelihoods. Although agriculture is the core livelihood strategy in Southern Africa, agricultural practices by farmers are unsustainable.  Carney (2002)  and  Toner (2002)  argue that CA could be a panacea to sustainable livelihoods for smallholder farmers amid poverty, vulnerability, political and economic instability and civil conflicts. However,  Gowing et al. (2008)    
 What is conservation agriculture? Conservation agriculture is based on three agronomic principles; (1) minimal soil disturbance, (2) permanent soil cover and (3) crop rotations  (FAO, 2001) . The first and second principles improve soil fertility, organic matter content and rain water infiltration especially in the 0 to 20 cm top layer considered the active yet most vulnerable zone for crop production while crop rotation reduces the necessity of pesticides and herbicides in the long run  (Derpsch, 2005) . According to  Hobbs (2006) ,  Hobbs et al. (2006)  and  FAO (2001)  conservation agriculture is a technology that conserves, improves and efficiently utilizes resources through integrated management of available resources combined with external inputs. The technology is variously known as conservation tillage, notillage, and zero-tillage; direct seeding/planting and crop residue mulching  (Baker et al., 1996; Ereinstein, 1999; Fowler et al., 2001) . Another variation of CA that has been promoted by the International Crop Research Institute for the Semi Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), the Food and Agricultural organization of the United Nations (FAO) and some local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Zimbabwe and Malawi is known as precision conservation agriculture (PCA)  (Twomlow et al., 2008) . PCA rests on four principles of; (a) minimum tillage; (b) precise application of small doses of nitrogen fertilizer; (c) combining high soil fertility with improved seed and (d) use of crop residues for permanent soil cover  (Twomlow et al., 2008) . Although conservation agriculture can be referred to by various names depending on scientists, where CA is promoted and the type of farmers targeted by the technology; CA hardly exists as a package proposed by the FAO, especially not in Southern Africa. 
 What constitutes adoption of CA? Technology adoption by farmers means sustained technology intervention practices long after projects have been terminated. However what constitutes adoption of CA in Southern Africa is not clear as different meanings have been espoused by different authors resulting in questions on whether to consider adoption as a 'discrete state with binary variables or a continuous measure?'  (Giller et al., 2009; Doss, 2006) .  Pannell et al. (2006)  argue that adoption is not an all-or-nothing decision characterized by a grey area between small-scale trialing and eventual adoption. For example,  Doss (2006)  states that a farmer growing at least one improved variety was considered an adopter in the 22 projects in East Africa that were implemented by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT). The phases in the conversion from traditional to conservation agriculture are as shown in  Kaumbutho et al. (2007) .  Figure 2  shows adoption as a continuous but non linear process occurring in phases of varying time frames, steps and sometimes ending in partial rather than full adoption. There are various phases of the behavior of output and profits during the adoption of CA, where the two decline initially before becoming positive. Phase 1 is mainly a learning phase during which farmers learn about the techniques of zero tillage as they adjust from traditional agricultural systems to CA. This first phase is characterised by decreases in labour, time and animal traction and accompanied by increases in the demand for agrochemicals  (FAO, 2004) . Improvements in soil fertility and further increases in crop yields are experienced during phase 2. Minimal profits realised at this stage are used to purchase appropriate implements and inputs. The cropping pattern gets more diversified leading to stable yields and further soil fertility improvement in phase 3. Total yield stability is achieved with peaks in both productivity and profits leading to higher food security, income and enhanced livelihoods in phase 4. According to  FAO (2001 FAO ( , 2004  four requirements must be satisfied for the adoption of CA by farmers; (1) benefits must be immediate and visible, (2) benefits must be substantial, (3) costs of technology dissemination must be affordable and finally, (4) support with extension services for considerable periods of time is necessary. Full benefits of CA on livelihoods can only be realized when all the three principles are well established  (FAO, 2001) . 
 Promoters of conservation agriculture in Southern Africa The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) through affiliate organizations such as the Center for International Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and the International Crop Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) have shown keen interest on CA in Southern Africa. In addition, FAO working together with ministries of agriculture's extension services and national agricultural research institutions (NARIs) are actively involved in CA projects in the region. Local NGOs like the African Conservation Tillage Network (ACT), Intermediate Technology Development Group (ITDG) and the Organization for Rural Agricultural Progress (ORAP) are major players in CA technology promotion in the region. As a result CA has been introduced in Lesotho, Namibia, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe  (FAO, 2007) . Empirical evidence on CA and livelihoods promotion efforts in Angola, Botswana, and Namibia by various organizations is scarce probably because ranching, mining and other livelihood strategies take precedence over crop farming in some of these countries. Usually funding for CA projects is provided by international research organizations and channeled through local NGOs, government departments and national agricultural research institutions. In Malawi, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe CIMMYT facilitates adoption of CA in maize based systems while CIAT attempts to develop sustainable marketing systems that help improve the competitiveness of smallholder farmers.  Heltberg et al. (2002)  argue that integrating farmers into the market economy requires stimulation of economic growth and development as most poor farmers remain outside the cash economy due high transaction costs and associated risks. 
 ADOPTION AND ADAPTATION OF CA IN SOUTHERN AFRICA Conservation agriculture in Southern Africa is characterized by partial adoption, sometimes referred to as 'distorted adoption' or 'farmer uptake'  (Giller et al., 2009) . From the dichotomous understanding of the CA concept, we note that there is marginal or zero-adoption Nkala et al. 5523 but adaptation to ensure CA complies with local conditions. Farmers are risk averse, and careful about experimenting with unknown technologies hence traditional practices usually continue on other parts of the fields. Observations in Mozambique show that smallholder farmers could adopt CA on any of their fields except where they would have planted sorghum because the 'stubbornness' of sorghum residues forces farmers to burn them as they prepare the land for the next planting season. In Zambia,  Haggblade et al. (2003)  lament lack of resources limiting smallholder farmers' in practicing ideal CA on all their land. The technology is implemented on small plots as an insurance against drought and famine since many believed that CA guarantees some level of yields even during years of drought. About 125 farmers, interviewed in central and southern Zambia revealed that 25% of cotton and 50% of their maize plots were under CA and overall CA accounted for 10 to 20% of cultivated land. Alongside (partial) adoption also dis-adoption of CA occurs, hence it is not surprising that there are many claims of adoption of CA during tenure of NGO and NARI programs which disappear when the projects terminate, raising critical questions about the sustainability of CA  (Giller et al., 2009; Bolliger, 2007) . When forerunners of CA like World Vision International (WVI), Development Aid from People to People (DAPP), the Southern Province Household Food Security Programme (SPHFSP) and the Monze Dioceses in Zambia terminated projects in 2003, no evidence of CA remained on the ground. There are many explanations for these CA adoption practices in Southern Africa. Some farmers join CA projects to access cheap inputs and other forms of support but revert to their traditional farming practices when such assistance stops. Inability to cope with intensive technology management requirements of CA as evidenced in Zambia also lead to dis-adoption of CA  (Haggblade et al., 2003; Mashingaidze et al., 2006) . Furthermore, ordinary smallholder farmers cannot emulate well resourced research institutions and NGOs despite skills and knowledge acquired from extension workers and scientists. In most cases only a few farmers who are not representative of the majority of local farmers participate in CA programmes introduced by NGOs. In addition, CA is not a technology for the poorly resourced farmers typically found in most countries in Southern Africa. The majority of farmers has no access to capital for purchase of agricultural implements and cannot afford ever rising costs for agrochemicals, seeds and other inputs  (Lal, 2009 ). Finally, we note that smallholder farmers in Southern Africa have reservations about the CA because the reductions in yields in the first few years worsen the already desperate situation of food security. We acknowledge that modern farmers are active participants, experimenters and re-designers of technologies fitting it into their specific conditions. Changing soil fertility, climatic conditions and socioeconomic factors throughout the trialing period coupled with the individual famer's economic, social and environmental goals influence adoption and adaptation patterns of the technology. We note that in some regions of Southern Africa CA is an attempt to dismantle traditional systems of rotational fallow, slash and burn agriculture still strong in the minds of the farmers. For this reason smallholder farmers never completely discard traditional agricultural systems and practices despite aggressive attempts to introduce new and innovative technologies. Solving adoption problems requires respecting the farmers' experiences and knowledge of their local conditions. 
 The livelihood impacts of conservation agriculture in Southern Africa The commonly discussed positive impacts of CA include increases in productivity through higher crop yields implying food security and consequently better economic and social wellbeing.  Pretty (1998 Pretty ( , 2000  noted these livelihood benefits among farmers who participated in the Machobane farming system in Butha Buthe and Tebellong communities in Lesotho. In Zambia,  Haggblade et al. (2003)  reported that CA livelihood outcomes among initial CA adopters include productivity level increases of 30 to 70%, diversification of production, increased social capital through farmers groups, less dependency on food aid and drought resilience.  Fowler et al. (2001)  reported increases of yields of up to 3.5 t ha -1 for most major crops and increased food security in the region. Similar results have been reported about CA in Zimbabwe by  Twomlow (2006 Twomlow ( , 2008 ,  Nyagumbo (1999) ,  Fowler et al. (2001)  and  Mashingaidze et al. (2006) . There is also evidence of limited benefits of CA from our discussions with CA farmers in Gondola, Gorongosa and Manica districts in Mozambique. We however take caution that attributing all livelihood benefits to CA in the absence of robust quantitative approaches capable of isolating effects of other exogenous factors could be oversimplification of an otherwise very complex process. Farmers usually express negative outcomes of CA including problems of labour distribution among various activities during the agricultural season, especially with weeds. According to  Riches et al. (1997)  weeding accounts for 60% of labor required for maize production and requires proper planning and effective management. Observations and discussions with farmers in Gondola, Gorongosa and Manica districts of Mozambique also revealed that there were weed control problems during the 2008/2009 season because of floods and incessant rains. These problems affected women more than men because in most traditional farming systems in the region, women and children are responsible for weeding. The problem becomes worse among smallholder farmers who lack capital to purchase herbicides and pesticides. 
 DISCUSSION Here, we present our discussion on how CA is interlinked with livelihoods with special focus on the technology's potential in Southern Africa taking cognizance of the various components of the sustainable livelihoods framework as discussed in  Chambers and Conway (1992) . We explore the link between CA and various livelihood outcomes including, vulnerability, capital assets, livelihood strategies and institutional arrangements on the understanding that economic and agricultural systems depend on natural, social, human, physical and financial capital endowments amid intermittent shocks and (seasonal) trends  (Coleman, 1990; Putnam, 1993; Costanza et al., 1997; Pretty, 1998; Pretty et al., 2000) . 
 Conservation agriculture and vulnerability in Southern Africa Extreme weather patterns, poor soils and lack of institutional support are some of the factors responsible for vulnerability of smallholder farmers in Southern Africa. Cultivation of marginal lands of declining soil fertility and low productivity levels also worsen vulnerability  (Norton, 1995) .  Barrios et al. (2008)  argue that agricultural production in SSA has been affected by climate change in the last half of the 20th century.  Jones et al. (2008)  further argue that impacts of climate change are likely to reduce crop yields by 20 to 30% by 2050 in already marginal cropping regions thereby necessitating a shift from dependence on cropping to livestock as a livelihood option for most poor rural households. On this front Mozambique suffers from severe droughts in some seasons although the country receives substantial amounts of rainfall during summer  (Barrios et al., 2008) . Since 2000, flooding has worsened farm productivity thereby increasing the vulnerability of smallholder farmers to both extreme rainfall patterns. Floods and wild fires damage various infrastructures such as roads and bridges further compounding transportation problems of agricultural inputs, equipment and personnel to remote areas. Poor extension services provision, poorly organized farmers' organizations, poor means of transport, and insufficient housing for extension workers in the districts also aggravate the vulnerability problem. Furthermore, farmers operate in inefficient product and credit markets characterized by highly distorted prices of both inputs and produce  (Kassie et al., 2009) . Finally, poverty, political and economic instability exacerbate the problem thereby dampening the impact of CA promotion programmes on livelihoods. 
 Conservation agriculture and ownership of assets in Southern Africa Limited access to assets and coping strategies forces farmers in Southern Africa to practice unsustainable livelihoods practices  (Cahn, 2003) . Conservation agriculture requires well resourced smallholder farmers regarding implements; basic finance and other livelihood assets but most farmers lack such basic resources  (Heltberg et al., 2002) .  Lal (2009)  argues that lack of proper seeding equipment like jab planters, disc planters, magoye rippers, zero-drills or cattle for draught power are the principal constraints to adoption of CA in SSA. In most cases organizations carrying out interventions provide such equipment during demo trials as happened in Pumbuto, Nhanguo and Ruaca in Mozambique during the 2008/2009 cropping season. Left alone smallholder farmers would use hand hoes, machetes and slashes which basic implements are owned by most farmers. Although about 94% of rural households' livelihoods in Mozambique are engaged in agriculture, land belongs to the state and farmers have no title to the land thus prohibiting use of land as collateral. We observe that land is not so limiting factor in Mozambique and farmers practice fallow systems to manage soil fertility problems giving the traditional practice of slash and burn system a comparative advantage over CA. 
 CA and transformation structures and livelihoods in Southern Africa Livelihoods are impacted on by transformation structures and processes which comprise both public and private institutions. The importance of these structures and processes characterized by NGOs, local traditional and central government, cannot be ignored in discussing their role in facilitating livelihood outcomes through CA in Southern Africa. These provide employment; agricultural inputs and equipment and also play a major role in influencing the direction of technology transfer. For example introducing CA in rural communities entails lobbying first at policy level to convince politicians and government officials. Rural communities in Southern Africa comprise a diversity of cultures, economies and traditional political systems which influence farmers' perceptions with regards to new agricultural technologies and livelihood patterns. Culture and traditions do influence the distribution of resources and technologies dissemination in various ways. In most cases communal people are not aware of the rules and regulations governing the use of resources such as land and pastures. In most cases the traditional and secular livelihoods transforming institutions are weak, ineffective and lack capital, financial and human resources for the effective management of common property resources. So are the management structures governing the role of farmers and their involvement, place and rights to resources, patterns of land use and tenure, dispute settlement, leadership and legal systems. Capacities associated with socioeconomic well-being, quality of technology and  Nkala et al. 5525  accessibility, research and extension and government and non-governmental institutional support including policy frameworks expected from administering institutions is largely sub-standard. These institutional problems militate against realization of positive impacts and livelihood outcomes in the smallholder agricultural sectors in the region. 
 Livelihood strategies and conservation agriculture in Southern Africa The potential impact of CA on livelihoods is linked to livelihood strategies which mainly comprise agriculture, remittances, microenterprise and trade among others. Livelihood strategies are various activities or adopted household behavior patterns undertaken to earn a living. These are important part of the assets-activities-outcome cycle in livelihoods analysis. The role of agriculture as a key livelihood strategy generating employment at microlevel and significant contributor to national income cannot be doubted  (Doss, 2006) . Subsistence agriculture supports approximately 90% of the households in Southern Africa  (Heltberg et al., 2002) . The high input requirements of CA preclude most smallholder farmers engaged in agriculture from realizing full benefits of this technology. Adopting off-farm livelihood strategies through remittances and pensions is a norm in countries like Lesotho, Malawi, South Africa, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe. Young people migrate to cities in search of greener pastures and formal employment largely because of low and unstable incomes from agriculture. Other livelihood strategies such as brewing traditional beer for sale particularly in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, to supplement household income are also common. The success of CA could be realized through the reversal of these off-farm livelihood strategies by exploiting their weaknesses and failures to provide formidable exit from agriculture. However, how CA could facilitate this transition to non-agriculture based livelihood strategies remains debatable and requires more investigation. This will be the subject of future research that seeks to identify livelihood transitions of smallholder farmers that can be attributed to CA in three communities in Gondola, Gorongosa and Manica districts of Mozambique. 
 Constraints against implementation of CA in Southern Africa Here, we outline and discuss constraints likely to be encountered during implementation of CA in Southern Africa noting that there is already a deep-rooted belief that all agriculture is conventional. Conservation agriculture has been successful in communities with fertile soils but its performance on poor degraded soils in Southern Africa remains unclear.  Giller et al. (2009)  argue that 'the plough has become a symbol of agriculture such that many people involved including, farmers, extension agents, researchers, university professors and politicians find it difficult to believe that agriculture can be possible without tillage'. Moreover, There is skepticism linked to the risk averse disposition of the farmers leading to the reluctance in adopting revolutionary technologies attempting to change the paradigm of farmers. It is difficult to realize a paradigm shift especially on long established practices. The success of CA also depends on its ability to transform mindsets of the smallholder farmers and perceptions on how CA can lead to desired livelihood outcomes. The top-down approach in technology transfer is another constraint leading to questions whether CA addresses the needs of farmers, scientists or policymakers  (Giller et al., 2009) ? Non-farmer driven interventions and approaches to technology dissemination tend to fail due to lack of ownership by farmers. The demise of externally driven interventions has been well documented and the introduction of CA in Southern Africa could face a similar fate. Other constraints directly relate to the principles of CA, particularly the permanent soil cover with crop residues for moisture retention, increased soil biological activity and better protection of the soil  (Hobbs, 2007) . Many farmers in Southern Africa collect crop residues and use them as stock feed especially in mixed farming systems where livestock are a major source of household income  (ICRISAT, 2006) . Crop residues are also removed by livestock that roam freely in the fields after harvesting in countries like Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Botswana and South Africa. So, for crop residues to effectively provide permanent soil cover or mulching farmers are forced to fence their fields.  Twomlow (2008)  argues that 'in systems where farmers are used to grazing cattle on other people's fields in winter, suddenly stopping it (for purposes of CA) would be socially unacceptable'. Furthermore, in Ruaca and Pumbuto communities in Mozambique, crop residues are decomposed by ants such that by the time the cropping season begins there will be no residues left in the field.  Giller et al. (2009)  argue that if mulching using crop residues improves infiltration, reduces surface erosion and water run-off and suppresses weeds then the benefits of mulching are diminished as a result of these processes. Social harmony and justice seen as part of the social benefits of CA may be an anathema whose solution requires the involvement of all farmers. The shortage or late arrival of inputs, inexperienced personnel and inadequate access to government extension services is a common problem in Southern Africa  (Pretty, 2000) . In some remote communities in many countries in Southern Africa government agricultural extension services are unknown and due to resource limitations NGOs cannot reach out to all farmers. In some instances where extension services are provided, extension workers look at their involvement in the CA projects as extra work for which they should be remunerated separately. Since CA is a knowledge intensive technology, it would be difficult to successfully promote this technology without the help of well-trained and experienced extension workers. Finally, financial support for the smallholder sector is limited in most countries with most smallholder farmers lacking access to credit for purchasing farm implements and inputs  (Ereinstein, 1999) . Financial institutions classify smallholder farmers as high risk borrowers with no immovable property to use as collateral, since they do not even have formal ownership of the land. Access to finance is therefore a serious constraint to the implementation of CA by the targeted group of smallholder farmers in the region. 
 Factors akin to livelihood improvements through CA in Southern Africa While there is general consensus about the theoretical potential social, economic and environmental benefits of CA as a sustainable agricultural practice, there are fears about sustainability of these outcomes in practice, especially on smallholder farmers  (Giller et al., 2009; Kassie et al., 2009) .  Heltberg et al. (2002)  and  Kassie et al. (2009)  argue that speedy infrastructure development and increased market opportunities as evidenced in the Dominican Republic, Kenya and Ethiopia, can lead to rapid adoption of CA and hence food security and better livelihoods among smallholder farmers. Jane  (1994)  believes that subsistence farming has considerable potential if adequate outlets and incentives are present; which in the case of Southern Africa are missing. Strengthening of government policies supportive of CA especially the provision of infrastructure like roads, dams and irrigations schemes is necessary. According to  Dumanski et al. (2006)  CA is best achieved when it is community driven, and farmers and their associations can identify best options for their local conditions. This way the mistake of taking 'one size fits all approach' linked to the success of CA in other parts of the world could be avoided. Smallholder farmers should no longer be regarded as passive adopters of technologies but active participants in the development of technologies that would work towards improvement of their own livelihoods.  Twomlow et al. (2008)  concluded CA will work in Southern Africa if sequenced in a manner that reflects the social, economic and biophysical constraints of the smallholder farmers. In other words CA should be adapted to suit limited resources, and low levels of education, vulnerability and chronic poverty. Technocrats working with farmers should particularize technology interventions to the physical and socioeconomic fundamentals of communities involved building on what farmers and their associations 'develop and own'. Such a farmer centered participatory technology development (PTD) approach helps the promoters of CA understand the actual priorities and the various pressing constraints of smallholder farmers, while it may also help farmers understand and appreciate the different principles of CA. Access to credit is an important factor in up-scaling CA in smallholder agriculture in Southern Africa since the absence of financial capital will prolong the transitions to better livelihoods. Deliberate policies that would enable farmers to use land as collateral in financial institutions however need to be developed through initiatives and discussions between government and financial institutions. This is because destructive elements of conventional tillage were subsidized in Africa through deliberate credit schemes and policies targeting special individuals or farmers groups  (Fowler et al., 2001) . Such support should not be politicized to enhance social justice and reduce moral hazard among farmers of different political inclinations as some party affiliates may view government assisted loans as 'gratis' and carrying no obligations for repayments on the part of farmers. 
 Conclusions From the discussions, we conclude that with numerous non-agricultural activities that have an equally damaging effect on the environment, CA may not be a sufficient condition for increased productivity and environmental conservation. The potential success of CA hinges on desirable but non-existent conditions casting doubt on realization of the envisaged livelihood benefits of CA given diverse conditions of farmers across the region. Reducing the length of the different phases in the adoption of CA could accelerate the realization of these livelihood outcomes. Agricultural policies that put sustainable agriculture at the centre, with appropriate donor and government support, incentives, and institutional reform, are necessary for the transformation of farmers' livelihoods through CA. Given the issues discussed, the implementation of CA should acknowledge and address the existing economic and ecological constraints facing farmers. Smallholder farmers should be given an opportunity to adapt CA to their local conditions, experimenting with several components to assess what aspects of CA work for them, where, how and when. Farmers should also be made to realize that switching to CA results in declining yields in the short-run calling for patience and necessary policy support through social safety nets during the transition period. Finally, we note that without required infrastructure, resources and skills for technology transfer, CA's potential contribution to livelihoods in Southern Africa remains a conundrum and subject of further research.

(Résumé d'auteur)","Bharath S., Cilas C., Umaharan P.. 2013. Fruit trait variation in a caribbean germplasm collection of aromatic hot peppers (Capsicum chinense Jacq.). HortScience, 48 (5) : p. 531-538.",22,20130607,Fruit Trait Variation in a Caribbean Germplasm Collection of Aromatic Hot Peppers (Capsicum chinense Jacq.),,"In the Caribbean, three of the five domesticated Capsicum species are cultivated: C. annuum (sweet peppers), C. frutescens (bird peppers), and C. chinense (aromatic hot peppers). However, C. chinense is commercially the most important throughout the region (DeWitt and  Bosland, 2009 ). South America is considered the center of origin and highest diversity of C. chinense  (Eshbaugh et al., 1983; Pickersgill, 1969) . Early geographical dispersion into the Caribbean may have occurred with the migrations of native Indians across the islands as well as through avian-aided dispersal  (Reid, 2009; Tewksbury and Nabhan, 2001) . Two points of entry into the Caribbean have been proposed  (Moses and Umaharan, 2012) : 1) from South America to Trinidad [across the land connection mentioned by  Kenny (2008)  that once existed between the two land masses] with subsequent movement across the other islands of the Southern Caribbean (Lesser Antilles); and 2) from Central America to the Northern Caribbean islands (Greater Antilles, the Bahamas)  (Fig. 1) . It is likely that through anthropogenic influences and long separation from the South American mainland, new varieties have arisen displaying useful plant adaptations and desirable fruit traits. Recent molecular studies revealed the importance of the Caribbean as an important region of this species' diversification  (Moses and Umaharan, 2012)  as well as a region containing some of the most aromatic pungent peppers in the world  (Bosland et al., 2012; Gibbs and O'Garro, 2004; Holder, 2008) . As a known region of diversity for C. chinense, the Caribbean varieties could be potentially useful sources of variation in agronomically important traits, e.g., early flowering and fruiting, desired fruit quality traits, suitable plant growth habit, and disease resistance, among others. The Caribbean is well known for its diverse range of pepper fruit forms and varied consumer preferences as a result of their varied cuisines. With the spread of Caribbean people and their cuisines to different parts of the world, aromatic hot peppers have fueled growing public interest in their cultivation for diverse commercial uses, e.g., the food industry (fresh consumption as a vegetable and processed products such as pepper mash, sauces, salsas, pickles, jams, and jellies), the defense industry (repellants, military use), pharmaceutical and health industries, and as ornamentals  (Bosland and Votava, 2003; Cichewicz and Thorpe, 1996; DeWitt and Gerlach, 1990; Elkins, 1997; Jancsó et al., 1984; Lo et al., 2005) . There has therefore been global increase in cultivation and parallel research and development to help meet the growing industry demands. In the Caribbean, although many varieties exist, few are formally known and commercially exploited. Many others remain as unstabilized landraces showing inconsistent fruit quality traits and yield. Consequently, foreign hybrids, capable of higher yields and more consistent fruit quality, are rapidly replacing local varieties and this contributes to ongoing decline in diversity available to regional breeders. This decline, coupled with limited varieties currently available for use, also restricts the ability of the regional pepper industry to exploit development of diverse pepper products  (Bharath, 2012) . Systematic replacement of local varieties could facilitate complete loss of unique, valuable Caribbean germplasm and prevent diversification of the value-added pepper product industry in the region with possible considerable economic and social impact.  Jarret and Berke (2008)  were the first to describe the morphological variation for fruit characteristics in an extensive USDA/ARS global C. chinense collection (330 accessions). However, only 14 accessions representing three Caribbean islands [Cuba (one), Puerto Rico (10), Trinidad (three)] were evaluated. The Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI) has also done some morphological characterization of regional varieties, but these were limited to eight to 10 landraces primarily from Trinidad,  Guyana, and Barbados (CARDI, 2002) . Most of the Caribbean's fruit diversity has therefore remained underrepresented in global and regional collections and consequently understudied and underdocumented even within the region itself  (Bharath, 2012) . There was therefore an urgent need to systematically document and characterize the region's current diversity and to place this diversity into regional context. This will serve as a necessary precursor to envisioned regional pepper breeding and improvement programs. This present study investigated variation in fruit morphology in a Caribbean C. chinense germplasm collection held at The University of the West Indies, Trinidad (UWI). This germplasm represents material collected from three major regions of diversity: Central America, the Caribbean Basin (northern and southern territories), and South America with representatives from geographic subgroups  (Fig. 2) . Using the international Capsicum descriptor guide  [International Plant Genetic Resources Institute et al. (IPGRI) , 1995] to morphologically characterize the accessions, this study aimed to determine 1) the level of interaccession variation across 13 fruit descriptors; 2) any links between quantitative and qualitative fruit traits; and 3) the level of fruit morphological dissimilarity among accessions based on their geographic origins. 
 Materials and Methods Germplasm. A total of 264 accessions were classed into eight geographic subgroups (  Fig. 2) : Central America, Greater Antilles/ Bahamas, Trinidad & Tobago, Lesser Antilles, Guiana Shield, Lower Amazon, Upper Amazon, and other regions. The subgroup ''other'' included accessions from regions outside of the aforementioned seven subgroups as well as accessions whose country data were unknown. Before fruit data collection, each accession was confirmed as C. chinense using the combination of listed floral traits presented by Palloix and Bosland (European Cooperative for Plant Genetic Resources, 2008). Experimentation. The seedlings were raised in trays containing a peat-moss mixture using standard nursery practices for hot peppers  (Adams et al., 2007)  and maintained at the UWI greenhouse. The seedlings were hardened when they were 4 weeks old and then transplanted into 20 cm diameter 3 30 cm depth ultraviolet-resistant plastic pots containing a mixture of two parts top soil:one part sand:one part cured manure. The trial was  conducted at the university's field plot with the plants arranged in a randomized complete block design with three blocks and one plant per block per accession. Plants were irrigated once per day and kept weed-free (manually) throughout the experiment. Fertilizer applications and pest and disease control measures followed standard recommended practices for local hot pepper production  (Adams et al., 2007) . Data collection. Thirteen fruits traits were scored  (Table 1 ) and 10 randomly selected fruits were used per accession replicate for evaluation of each trait. The scoring classes provided by the IPGRI descriptor guide  (IPGRI et al., 1995)  were used for categorizing immature and mature fruit colors, fruit shape, pedicel persistence with fruit, and approximate placenta size. Fruit length, width, and pedicel length measures were taken using digital calipers (Tchibo, GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). Fruit weight measures were taken using a top pan balance (Thomas Scientific Model T410+, Swedesboro, NJ). All traits except immature fruit color were assessed at the fully mature, ripened stage. Fruit color was assessed using the Royal Horticultural Society's color chart. Pedicel persistence with fruit (pedicel remained firmly attached to the ripe fruit at harvest) was determined using the harvesting technique described by  Motsenbocker (1996) . Placenta size was determined relative to the fruit length: using a metric ruler, the placenta and fruit lengths were measured, the ratio calculated, and the number obtained was assigned to the IPGRI descriptor categories provided  (Table 1) . Four descriptors not present in the IPGRI list (fruit surface gloss, pericarp folding, presence of a tail, fruit surface pebbling) were included among the qualitative traits collected, because these features were consistently seen in some accessions of the collection. These four descriptors were assessed based on an in-house scoring method. Fruit surface gloss was evaluated under natural light and referred to the presence/absence of a very shiny fruit surface  (Fig. 3A) . Pericarp folding (best demonstrated in the Scotch Bonnet variety) refers to the convex folded form of the pericarp generally toward the distal end of the fruit  (Fig. 3B ). Descriptor states scored were absence/presence. The tail referred to the narrow elongation (whether slight or pronounced) of the distal end of the fruit  (Fig. 3C ) and was scored as either absent or present. Surface pebbling referred to points along the fruit surface where distinct, firm surface protrusions (varying sizes) were observed  (Fig. 3D ) and was scored based on absence/presence despite observed variation in number and distribution of this feature along the fruit. In addition to scoring this trait, preliminary anatomical evaluation was done to determine the physical nature of this feature. Using fresh pericarp material from five fruits of 1) smooth-surfaced and 2) pebbled fruits, thin sections were made, stained, and mounted according to the procedures outlined by  Johansen (1940) . The prepared slides were then examined using a light microscope (Olympus Optical Co. Ltd., Japan). Data analysis. All 13 traits were evaluated at three levels: 1) accession; 2) geographic subgroups (eight); and 3) major geographic regions of which there were three: Central America/Northern Caribbean, Southern Caribbean, and South America  (Fig. 1) . As a result of unavoidable circumstances with fruit material of some accessions (predominantly Trinidad & Tobago accessions), not all 264 accessions could be scored completely for each trait. This necessarily reduced the possibility of a thorough analysis of individual accessions across all 13 descriptors. However, for all geographic regions and subgroups used in the study, the populations evaluated remained well represented. The data collected and analyzed therefore still provided useful insight into the variation and morphological structure of the collection. Qualitative trait data were summarized to provide frequencies per class of trait and c 2 analyses performed to assess relationships between traits and geographic origin using XLSTAT 2008.08.03 (Addinsoft, USA). Quantitative trait data were evaluated using analysis of variance to determine the level of variation among the accessions. Broad-sense heritability values along with the associated   (119) ; light (< 5 g) (104) z Accession totals vary for different traits due to loss of fruit before collection or absence of suitable fruit material at the time of scoring. y Descriptor traits not included in the IPGRI Capsicum descriptor guide  (IPGRI et al., 1995) . confidence intervals were also estimated for these quantitative traits using the Wald method  (Agresti and Coull, 1998) . Estimations of heritabilities were given by the ratios of genetic variances, i.e., « variety » variances and phenotypic variances: H 2 b ¼ s 2 G s 2 P ¼ s 2 v s 2 v þ s 2 e where H 2 b = broad-sense heritability, s 2 G and s 2 P are, respectively, genetic and phenotypic variances, and s 2 v and s 2 e are, respectively, variety and error variances. Genetic correlations were then estimated between the quantitative traits. The random model was applied for multivariate analysis, allowing for an estimation of genetic covariances and correlations between these traits  (Hill, 1971) . Variance analysis was used to determine any links between fruit weight (as a variable) and the qualitative traits (as factors). These data analyses were done using SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Agglomerative hierarchical clustering (Ward's method) was used to determine the dissimilarity among the accessions (using XLSTAT 2008.08.03). As a result of missing data points for different accessions across different traits, and a need to retain the largest number of accessions for the cluster analysis, only three fruit traits (weight, shape, and mature color) were used. These three traits were selected based on their primary importance for consumers and allowed the successful analysis of 234 accessions (89% of the original total) with all eight geographic subgroups represented. 
 Results 
 Qualitative traits Fruit color. Four main immature fruit colors were found in the collection  (Table 1) : white, yellow, green (three categories), and purple. Green-colored fruit was most common [light green (102 accessions); green (132 accessions); dark green (nine accessions)]. Across the major geographic regions  (Table 2) , South America (specifically the Upper Amazon) contained the largest range of color states (six), exceeding Central America/Northern Caribbean (five states) and the Southern Caribbean (four states). Twelve mature color states were found in the collection, but red fruits were most common [light red (15 accessions); red (72 accessions); dark red (69 accessions)]  (Table 1) . South America contained the largest number of color states (12) and exceeded the 10 states found in the Southern Caribbean and the nine states of Central America/Northern Caribbean  (Table 2) . Fruit shape. Five descriptor states were observed: blocky fruit was most common by a small margin (86 accessions) followed by campanulate fruit (79 accessions). South America displayed the lowest range of states (four) and was exceeded by the Southern Caribbean and Central America/Northern Caribbean (both displayed five states). Pedicel persistence with the fruit. Persistent pedicels (firmly attached to the fruit at harvest) were most common throughout the collection (230 accessions) but all regions contained several accessions with less persistent pedicels. South American accessions (specifically the Upper Amazon) displayed all three degrees of persistence as did the Southern Caribbean accessions, whereas Central America/Northern Caribbean contained accessions with only two states; the pedicels were either easy to remove or they were firmly attached to the fruit at harvest. Placenta size. All geographic regions contained accessions displaying the two states found in the collection; however, fruit types containing smaller placentas (i.e., onefourth to half fruit length) were more common than types with placentas greater than half the fruit length (125 vs. 79 accessions).   3  3  60  8  5  3  3  5  Tail  Absent  18  13  121  15  26  11  25  14  Present  1  0  13  1  1  1  1  0  Pebbling  Absent  0  13  125  15  26  12  26   Fruit gloss, pericarp fold, and tail. Glossy fruit was more common than non-glossy fruit in this collection (176 vs. 72 accessions), but both states were displayed across all regions. The pericarp fold (80 accessions) and the tail (18 accessions) were not dominant features in the collection but were still found in accessions of the three major regions studied and were notably most frequent in the Southern Caribbean. Surface pebbling. This trait was found only in 12 accessions of the collection [derived from the Southern Caribbean and South America (specifically the Guiana Shield region)]. Preliminary analysis of the surface pebbling showed that sections of smoothsurfaced fruit displayed no epidermal pebbling even in the cross-section  (Fig. 4A) , whereas fruit with a pebbled epidermis revealed lignified cells and increased suberin levels immediately at the pebbled zones (red-stained regions). Notably, larger pebbled areas displayed considerable cell wall lignification and suberized zones  (Fig. 4B-D) . 
 Quantitative traits Distributions of all four quantitative traits were normal and analysis of variance showed significant differences (P < 0.0001) among accessions for each trait measured  (Tables 3  and 4 ;  Fig. 5 ). The highest estimated heritability values were found for fruit weight and fruit width (0.810 and 0.807, respectively). The collection contains predominantly light to intermediate weight fruits of intermediate fruit length and wide fruit widths with intermediate length pedicels. The Southern Caribbean accessions displayed highest average values for fruit length, width, and weight  (Fig. 5) , whereas the highest average pedicel length was found in the Northern Caribbean accessions. However, the variances for each of these four traits in the Southern Caribbean accessions (particularly Trinidad & Tobago) were always the lowest of all regions represented  (Table 4 ;  Fig.  5 ). Conversely, South America and Central America/Northern Caribbean (despite their substantially smaller number of accessions) displayed much higher variances in these four quantitative traits. Notably, the variances found in the South American accessions exceeded those of Central America/Northern Caribbean in all the quantitative traits except fruit weight. 
 Correlation analysis of the quantitative traits The correlation matrix (data not shown) revealed a moderate significant positive association between pedicel length and fruit length (r = 0.54; P < 0.05), fruit length, and fruit weight (r = 0.53; P < 0.05) and between pedicel length and fruit weight (r = 0.48; P < 0.05). The largest correlation coefficient was found between fruit width and fruit weight (r = 0.80; P < 0.05). 
 Qualitative and quantitative trait interactions No significant link was found between fruit weight and fruit gloss (P = 0.23). However, highly significant links (P < 0.0001) existed between fruit weight and 1) immature fruit color (F = 4.78); 2) mature color (F = 5.39); 3) fruit shape (F = 29.17); and 4) pericarp folding (F = 31.70) with the largest magnitude of interaction found with 5) placenta size (F = 61.32). 
 Cluster analysis Dissimilarity analysis produced four main clusters  (Fig. 6)  with no immediately distinct separation of accessions based on major geographic region, because all clusters contained accessions from most regions  (Table 5) . However, analysis at the level of geographic    subgroup revealed a significant link (df = 21; c 2 = 32.671; P < 0.0001; a = 0.05) between accession distribution and the clusters to which they were assigned. Cluster 1 (containing marginally most accessions from the Lesser Antilles) and Cluster 3 (containing most accessions of Trinidad & Tobago, other regions) were more closely related to each other than they were to Clusters 2 and 4. Cluster 4 contained most of the accessions of Central America, the Northern Caribbean (notably represented only by   6 . Cluster analysis of a subset of the C. chinense accessions (234) using three fruit descriptors. Geographic regions listed beneath Clusters 1, 3, and 4 highlight the partitioning of geographic subgroups into these particular clusters.  Table 5  provides the complete list for each cluster. accessions from the Bahamas and Puerto Rico), Guiana Shield, and both Amazon regions. Cluster 2 was most different from the other three clusters and contained a small number of accessions from every region except the Greater Antilles. Ranking of the clusters for average fruit weight revealed in descending order: Cluster 1 > Cluster 2 > Cluster 3 > Cluster 4. Regarding fruit shape and color, Cluster 1 contained campanulate red fruit, Cluster 2 contained campanulate orange-yellow fruit, Cluster 3 contained campanulate dark red fruit, and Cluster 4 contained triangular red fruit. 
 Discussion Our findings indicate that there is significant and potentially unique fruit trait variation in this germplasm collection. The high broadsense heritabilities and strong significant correlation between fruit width and weight make these two traits suitable for improvement through breeding. In the accessions of the Southern Caribbean, the low variances in fruit weight, width, length, and pedicel length (despite higher numbers of accessions compared with the other two major regions) suggest considerable preferential selection for these traits in the Southern Caribbean. This possibly indicates higher production and consumption of fruits with these traits as well as a systematic narrowing of the genetic variation in these Southern Caribbean varieties. Not surprisingly, the mega-centers of diversity (Central and South America) together presented the highest variances in these four quantitative fruit traits. This lends support to the findings that main centers of origin and diversity tend to display high trait variation and this variation decreases as there is movement away from the mainland  (Frankham et al., 2002) . Although dissimilarity analysis of the accessions did not show clear separation of any major geographic region  (Table 5) , there is still some indication of morphological clustering based on geographic subgroups within the four clusters. This observation was also made in the molecular diversity analysis  (Moses and Umaharan, 2012) . Most Southern Caribbean accessions (65%) are morphologically quite similar to each other, as seen by the proximity of Clusters 1 and 3. However, these Southern Caribbean accessions were far less similar to most Central and South American accessions and those of the Northern Caribbean (particularly the Bahamas and Puerto Rico) found in Cluster 4  (Fig. 6 ). This suggests underlying genetic differences between certain accessions of the Southern Caribbean and the other geographic regions. The similarity of variances between accessions of the Northern Caribbean and Central America, coupled with the clustering of most of their accessions in Cluster 4, suggests underlying genetic similarity resulting from possible introduction of types into the Northern Caribbean (especially the Bahamas and Puerto Rico) from the Central American regions. These fruit morphological studies suggest that the Southern Caribbean subpopulation (Lesser Antilles/Trinidad & Tobago) of Clusters 1 and 3 could have formed as a result of 1) strong historical and geographical isolation from the South American mainland population as well as 2) active selection for larger, heavier fruit. The genetic data  (Moses and Umaharan, 2012)  revealed that the Guiana Shield group contained accessions that fell into both the Upper and Lower Amazon groups. This finding is supported by our morphological study because these Guiana Shield accessions are included in Cluster 4 together with the majority of Lower and Upper Amazon accessions. Unlike the molecular findings, however, the Northern Caribbean accessions (specifically from the Bahamas and Puerto Rico) could not be morphologically distinguished from the Central and South American groups. Strong physical similarities therefore exist among the populations of this collection, but the underlying genetic variability gives us an opportunity to exploit this variation for breeding and subsequent commercial use. The four additional traits scored in this study provided a unique opportunity to highlight accessions with traits not generally consciously sought after by (especially Caribbean) consumers but influential nonetheless in their choice of peppers for consumption. Fruit gloss serves primarily an aesthetic role in peppers because it is associated with fruit freshness and visual appeal, which are important first impressions for consumers. The intensity of gloss is a function of wax chemical composition and wax serves an important physiological role in the fruit regarding water loss and surface permeability  (Kolatukuddy, 1984; Lownds et al., 1993; Mintz-Oron et al., 2008) . The significant link between folded pericarp and fruit weight may have possible implications for breeders and producers. The folded pericarp is a standard identifier of the Scotch Bonnet variety and its occurrence in other varieties has sometimes created identity confusion for consumers and misuse by vendors seeking a higher price (personal observation). The tail feature (unknown origin) is now a signature trait of the world-famous Trinidad Butch T Scorpion and Trinidad Moruga Scorpion pepper varieties. If it is indeed unique to the Scorpion varieties, it may provide a means of rapid field identification. The pebbled fruit surface, generally unattractive to many consumers, is locally considered (i.e., Trinidad) as a sign of high fruit pungency and is interestingly always found on fruit surfaces of extremely pungent landraces (e.g., the Scorpion, Congo, Seven Pot) of Trinidad (personal observations). It is also strikingly demonstrated on the fruits of the Bhut Jolokia (personal observations). The anatomical studies revealed that these pebbled areas demonstrate features typical of a plant's wounding response  (Rittinger et al., 1987; Walter et al., 1990) . Pest or insect attacks have not been considered plausible explanations for these wounded areas because routine crop management greatly reduced their populations. These pebbled zones may therefore indicate an event intrinsic to the pungent fruits themselves. We currently hypothesize that the prominent cell wall lignification displayed  (Fig. 4)  may be analogous to the blistering seen on the epidermis of the placenta resulting from accumulation of the capsaicinoids just beneath the epidermal surface  (Stewart et al., 2007) . Further work is required to fully explain the origin of this feature. Demonstration of a link between high pungency and surface pebbling could provide an invaluable means of rapid field identification of very pungent varieties. Despite gaps in the data set (primarily for some accessions of Trinidad & Tobago), we were still able to adequately represent the major geographic regions and their subgroups and evaluate the overall value of the accessions in this collection. This fruit descriptor study has documented a significant and interesting range of variation across several fruit quality traits and has allowed us to compile a working database for these accessions. This database now provides useful reference information for 1) possible immediate use of select accessions for commercial purposes (fresh market, fresh fruit processing, dried spice market, oleoresin extraction, ornamental plants); and for 2) identification of parent material for variety improvement and other breeding studies. We have also demonstrated possible key underlying genetic differences among accessions of the three major regions of diversity: Central America, the Caribbean Basin, and South America. This provides justification for continued conservation and more in-depth evaluation of the accessions in the collection. It also highlights the need to maintain a broad genetic base in the Southern Caribbean accessions to facilitate diverse industry needs. Use of this morphological information together with the existing genetic diversity data  (Moses and Umaharan, 2012)  is expected to contribute to future decisions concerning use of these germplasm resources as well as guide future germplasm introductions that will complement the existing genetic diversity of this collection.

This range of models, from the more aggregated to the more explicit one, reveals that they no treat the same question, and that hypotheses, objectives and scales varied. To this variety of models corresponds a variety of validation methods. In a way, the ABM is more descriptive and explicative, but the way it is validated need to be formalized. Deforestation of the rainforest has been studied in Eastern Madagascar mainly by spatial analysis of past aerial and satellite images  [GS90] . In the case of these rainforests, it has been demonstrated a return to a forest state if no crop, no fire, and no pasture are applied to a plot after crop abandonment, during a long time (30 to 50 years). But few researches were dedicated to post-forest land use dynamics and forest regeneration  [RSC07] . Prospective models are lacking to predict the impacts of incentive conservation measures. We are tackling the following questions: what is the applied problem, the global context of malagasy rainforest? How to influence farmer practices to obtain a required landscape? How to involve farmers in forest conservation with clear incentives measures? The more general question is then to identify the effect of farm diversity on land use decision and forest conservation. The main objective of our modeling process is to link rainforest conservation objectives with farmer's strategies and practices to be able to reduce the deforestation trends via farm incentives. Deforestation must be studied into the forest and on the borders, since post forest land uses in slopes increase after paddy field saturation is achieved in marshlands  [RRRH10] . However, the transfer of forest management from public Water and Forest administration to local communities, via local contracts (Gelose in 1996, effective since 2000), limited the access to forest resources. Since 2000, farmers have then adapted their production system to this reduced access to forest land  [Toi09] . Farmers took two kinds of decision: to slash and burn a new plot into the forest, and to let a cultivated plot into fallow (plot abandonment), when the plot does not produce enough. Post-forest land use is described, at the plot level, both as crop-fallow successions after the first forest clearing and as vegetation successions after each plot abandonment. Studying land use dynamics at the plot level (1) enables to link the resulting landscape to farmer practices, (2) supposes plot distribution into farms and number and size of these plots (that means farm diversity) have influence in land use decision and forest conservation. In the case of forest conservation, it helps to design economic incentives devoted to the farmers to reduce the incidence or frequency of slash and burn practices. An agent-based model (ABM) was designed to model deforestation in Madagascar rainforest and to test explicit scenarios pertinent to account for farmers' decision making. The use of ABM deals with the Malagasy deforestation problem via the post-forest transitions operated by farmers. However, the calibration and validation of such a model raise particular challenges. The large number of parameters in an ABM makes its calibration difficult  [GM07] . In order to tackle this problem, we propose to calibrate the agent behaviors through an average behavioral model using a timed automaton model (TAM), which is easier to calibrate on a mean behavior. The ABM validation relies on the adequate production of a global phenomenon from local interactions. In our case, the local interactions are land use transitions at a plot scale, based on historical records of crop-fallow successions after the first forest clearing. The global phenomenon to produce is the evolution of a landscape in terms of spatialized land use successions. From plots to landscape, as it is impossible to reproduce exactly what happened, we propose to statistically summarize the global phenomenon with a Markov chain model (MCM). This technique enables us to compare both observed field data and data issued from ABM simulations. In the following sections, we first present a state of the art on model validation and more specifically on ABM validation. Then, we describe the adopted methodology of validation before showing and discussing our results. We finish with a general discussion on the validation of such a complex system with a simple mathematical model. 2. State of the arts: model validation 2.1. Model validation  [ARB06]  defines ""verification"" as checking the conformity of an implemented software against specifications, ""calibration"" as identifying where, in the space of parameters, the model has the expected properties, and ""validation"" as meeting the user needs with the delivered software. The verification and the validation of a model are relative to the model objective, either predictive, or for understanding how does the system operate.  [Ryk96]  suggests, before any kind of validation, to define not only the objective but also the criteria of acceptance and the context of operation of the model. Many validation tests are conducted all over the modeling and simulation process, during the initial stages of data collection and analysis, when the conceptual model is built, as well as during the production of results by the operational model.  [LF05]  suggested that model validity must be assessed relatively to the objective at each step of the modeling and simulation process because each step brings its own source of errors. Many authors  [CH97, ARB06]  agree that validation is not universal, nor unique. Validation techniques depend on the model objective and its domain of application. Other kinds of validation have been proposed, either model-centered or user-centered. Model-centered validation, called functional validation, corresponds to the design of an experimental plan to analyze the influence of several combined factors on a global result of the model. User-centered validation is defined by the problems that are sought to be solved by the use of the model. Coherency (the model is not internally contradictory) or veracity (the model does not contradict the reality), evaluated by experts of the same scientific domain, users or actors, increase trust in the results of the model  [Bom97]  Role-playing games or visual simulations are considered as forms of validation  [ARB06, Guy06] . Visual interactive simulation allows modifying the parameter values during simulation. With graphic animations, the user may gain understanding of the model behavior, gain implication if he changes the parameter values, and link these results to his knowledge of the real system. Validation may be a condition of confidence that the model would be used in the future.  [Sar84]  defined the validation as a proof that the model has a reasonable margin of confidence in its domain of application. The model is considered valid when the simulated data are very similar to the observed data. We will keep this last definition in the following. 
 ABM validation How much confidence can we give to an agent-based model? Many users prefer ABM to mathematical equations because those models are more intuitive. However  [Def05]  asks: ""do they really increase our knowledge on the studied dynamics?"" Due to their complexity and high number of parameters, ABM are generally more difficult to calibrate and validate than the other modeling approaches  [BP07] . Several tests exist in the object-oriented approach when validation, as a measure of similarity with observed data, is not sufficient.  [Axe97]  claimed for such a model comparison along with sensitive analysis in the case of ABM applied to social sciences: ""computational modeling would have never provided the clear sense of domain of validity that typically can be obtained for mathematical theories""  [Axe97]  .  [Bou95]  proposes to validate ABM at a more global level of organization. The artificial universe of ABM has been built with forms, typologies, distributions, and qualitative models, from which a global behavior emerges. An ABM may be validated when compared with the formalization of this knowledge at a superior level of organization. Moreover, to assure robust conclusions, many simulations have to give the same results. Temporal dynamics at the local scale allow simulations on hundreds of years, without possible data to confirm these dynamics. Spatial distribution at a global scale may be compared to actual maps and, as a consequence, may be more easily used in validation protocols.  [CBND02]  adopted such a spatial validation with an ABM at the village level. This ABM has been validated by simulation: (1) testing hypothesis on the relative impact of some factors (access, land property rules, agriculture-livestock interactions) on agrarian dynamics, and (2) evaluating the gap between simulated and actual maps of land use. Simulations are initialized by the map of the simulated village, by a geographic information system with information on land use in 1990, including access, land availability for cropping and socio-economic data on the villages. Different ABM validation processes have been proposed, but without total satisfaction. The consequences are three: ABM is difficult to compare to other models, ABM prospective use is criticized and more confidence is needed for ABM. Lobry proposed to build the mathematical theory of ABM  [TDM + 07] . Checking the coherency of a process may be currently done by mathematics, but only if the process is homogenous and the number of agents is small  [TDZ08] . In the case of a complex system unsolved with mathematical equations, simulation is necessary. But computer sciences may not solve every kind of problem. This explains why multiagent systems are normally more criticized than others. [Gin03] proposes a statistical approach of ABM, rethinking the building, understanding and use of complex systems in the basis of re-peated simulations with their respective statistical treatment. Calculating the variance of the response of the model, parameter per parameter, on the total range of variation of each parameter, allows to test how much each parameter contributes to the response variability of the model. Sensitivity analysis can be used on continuous and discrete parameters, initial conditions, stochastic components, and numeric resolution. However, any systematic exploration would need heavy statistics tools because the number of variables is high  [GM07] . The ABM produces too much information, and the problem is how to control this complexity. Two options are available: 1) To start with simple mechanisms and to progressively complexify them. 2) To differentiate part of the system, express all its complexity, and then add progressively other mechanisms. We selected the first option: to accept to have a first look on a simplified image of the reality, namely the changes and sequences of four land use states using Markov chains. Our aim is to use this mathematical model to validate an ABM. We illustrate this option in the case of deforestation in Madagascar, with an ABM based on post forest dynamic of land use system. The objective, hypothesis, method and initial state of this model are defined in  [RHRM11] . 
 Materials and methods 
 Available databases Both the historical land-use database and the farm typology database were elaborated on the western border of the forest corridor of Fianarantsoa, which links the national parks of Ranomafana and Andringitra. Generally speaking, ecological and socio-economic data are rarely collected together. The land-use database results from direct observations of annual plot use between 2003 and 2006 and inquiries about plot use since first forest clearing (1973) with owners, neighbors and local guides. Since the data is historical from an initial forest cover to an actual agricultural use, it appears necessary to cross different information sources, especially direct observation with historical surveys. The typology database is issued from a PhD thesis in agronomy and geography realized during the period 2004-2009 in the Western and Eastern sides of the forest corridor of Fianarantsoa  [Toi09] . This farm typology was built with an emphasis on farm spatial organization and on farm adaptation to forest conservation. It resulted in 5 types of farms. To simplify the use of this data in an ABM, these 5 types of farms were brought together into 3 types of farms: savannah, mixed and forest types. In fact, the landscape bordering the Fianarantsoa corridor is structured in three bands, defined by their distance to the forest: savannah, savannah-forest, and forest. 
 Land use transitions Mixed forest and farm landscape dynamic is summarized into six land use states: forest, crop, fallow, grass, paddy field and plantation, and the possible transitions between these six states (  Figure 1 ). Paddy field and plantation are states of long duration, resulting from heavy transitions. They remain the same for either a long time (plantation) or even definitively (paddy fields). Therefore, the active transitions we may observe through historical data concern only four states: forest, crop, fallow and grass. We call ""fallow"" what occurs to the plot after harvest, with a shrub regeneration, and ""grass"" the herbaceous cover that appears only after a determined number of crop-fallow cycles. In order to analyze these data, we first consider stochastic chains of land use transitions. In order to analyze the behavior of the individual farmers, they are considered to follow the same decision rules for the duration of each of the three temporary land uses. The number of crop-fallow cycles defines the cultivation intensity. This additional parameter is necessary because a high number of cycles is an indication of the occurrence of grass after crop. In the following, each of the possible land use is coded as a letter as follows: forest→ F , crop→ C, fallow→ J, grass→ G, plantation→ To choose the plot to cultivate, the farmer has the choice among various initial land cover. The farmers ordinate the states previous to cropping in an order which respects two principles: to maintain soil fertility and to reduce hand work. The farmers invest their work in plots where they expect higher yields. Manually ploughing of grassland is considered less work than forest slash and burn, but more work than cultivating a previously harvested plot (continuous cropping). The ordering based on increasing invested work is: C → C, G → C, F → C. Globally, fallow age is a good indicator of soil fertility. The ordering based on increasing soil fertility is then: C → C, G → C, J → C, F → C. But this order of preference for crop precedence: Forest (F ) > Fallow (J) > Plantation (P ) > Grass (G) > Crop (C) cannot be respected in a context of forest conservation. Forest being protected, farmers may choose between two strategies when they adapt their current ordering: 1) J → C, before G → C, before F → C, before C → C, when farmers accept to preserve forest from slash and burn, but at last, they will choose a new plot in forest before accepting to cultivate one year more a plot which does not produce enough. In this case, they exploit mature forest soil fertility to preserve the soil fertility into their own plots. 2) J → C, before G → C, before C → C, before F → C, when farmers accept to preserve forest from slash and burn, choosing other land covers before crop, including last crop. This ultimate strategy supposes that continuous cropping is possible, either using new cropping techniques available to restore soil fertility, or with a systematic weed control. The TAM and the ABM have been designed with the order (1). 
 The models 
 The MCM The temporal sequences of plot land use are complex data. They include first forest clearing date, crop successions, crop and fallow sequences, post-cropping vegetal successions. Many works have used Markov models to represent the dynamics of vegetation or land cover  [LDL85, Tur87, Bal00, Lui02, RRRH10] . In our work, Markovian matrices are used to summarize the complex information on changes and sequences of land use with four states, on a stochastic basis. Formally, given a set of possible states for each plot of the landscape, in our case forest, crop, fallow and grass, a Markov state is a vector representing the probability distribution over this set of states. In our case, the probability distribution represents the probability for a plot to be in a given state in the landscape at a given time. A transition matrix encodes the evolution of this landscape at each step (here the step is one year). The multiplication of the Markov state vector by the transition matrix provides the new probability distribution at the next time step. Therefore, given sequences of landscape states, the calibration consists in building a Markov matrix. Given the initial distribution of land cover for the landscape, the MCM is able to reproduce the sequence of distribution of plots on the landscape. 
 The TAM In the TAM, the dynamics is represented by a timed automaton. To make this process spatially explicit, this model has been implemented as a cellular automaton where each cell represents a plot driven by a timed automaton. A global (landscape level) algorithm selects a new plot to be cultivated after a plot has been abandoned, to maintain the same number of cultivated plots and to stabilize the food supply of the families. The priority to select a new plot is defined by the transition rules (3.2). The timed automaton has four parameters: the three time delays for crop, fallow and grass, and the number of crop-fallow cycles, since the first forest clearing. The crop time delay means the number of annual successive crops. The crop-fallow cycle is determined by the respective crop and fallow delay times; it begins with crop and ends with fallow, before another cropping. Time delays are calculated from the database for each of the land use state: crop, fallow and grass. These time delays can also be obtained by calculating statistics on the time series: average, standard deviation, and median. However, using the timed automaton presents some limits. On one hand, population scenarios with timed automata are rough and indirect, for example, changing the one-to-one ratio to a one-to-two ratio. With ABM, these scenarios can be more detailed and explicit with, for example, changes in initial populations or demographic rates. On the other hand, farmer population is not homogeneous, therefore, an average behavior is not realistic. The richest farmers are those who have enough resources to contract labour to slash and burn forest and, therefore, to exploit forest soil fertility. The adaptation capacity to a limited access to forest plots depends on the spatial distribution of plots within the farm  [TSHL11] . 
 The ABM These arguments made us choose an ABM in which: 1) The spatial constraints are supposed to influence farmers' adaptation to a limited access to forest; they are summarized by distance from forest: plots into the forest, near the forest, out of the forest. We divided the landscape into three bands parallel to the forest linear corridor, from the East to the West: forest, forest border, savannah. 2) The demographic process is a key factor in explaining land use transitions. The ABM allows to explicit demographic parameters as initial population and demographic growth rate. 3) Land use decision may vary around average decision rules, according to farm strategies. To maintain the food supply of the family is a survival strategy that can be qualified as ""simple reproduction"". To open more plots than actually needed by the family is a growing land access strategy to secure future access to land for the next generation; it can be qualified as ""enlarged reproduction"". The resulting ABM is illustrated by an UML conceptual model (  Figure  2 ). Following  [TSHL11] , we introduce a typology of only three types of farms (forest, mixed and savannah farms), depending on the distance to the forest. The village territory is composed of three zones, forest, forest border and savannah. The population of plots managed by a farm is part of the village territory. Land use states differ between rain fed slopes and plane marshlands. Finally the time delays and the number of cycles issued from the timed automaton along with the farm typology are used to generate the ABM.  Figure 3  illustrates the whole calibration/validation process. First the observed data, i.e. sequences of land cover successions, are used to calibrate a Markov chain, producing a transition matrix (1). This transition matrix is considered as the reference summary of the land use dynamics. The timed automaton model, parametrized by the time delays for each state, and the number of crop-fallow cycles, then run to simulate the land use dynamics. The generated data is used to calibrate a new Markov chain, producing a new transition matrix (2). The comparison between the observed transition matrix (1) and the matrix issued from timed automaton simulation (2) is used to adjust the time delays and the number of cycles until both matrices are close enough. Notice that the calibration process produces an adjustment of the model parameters while the validation process produces a yes/no answer (is the model valid or not?).  In our case, we take care of validating the model with another set of data than the data used to calibrate, both on another period and on another site. The model is considered validated when the simulated data are very similar to the observed data. Two land-use data subset were then separated on a geographical basis: 104 plots dispersed in the forest border and 66 plots grouped in two small watersheds. The first dataset, covering a period of 34 years , was used to calibrate the timed automaton. The second dataset, which covers a period of 22 years , was used to validate the model. 
 The validation process The time delays and number of cycles, calibrated above, are used as parameters in the ABM. The ABM simulation produces new data on which a new Markov chain can be calibrated (3). The resulting matrix is used to compare the observed data and the ABM simulated data. The comparison between real data and simulated data is tested by a χ 2 comparison of two transition matrices. These two matrices are the summary of crop and fallow successions issued respectively from the simulation of the calibrated ABM (3) and the observed dataset (1). If we make the hypothesis that both processes are the same, the simulated transition matrix should be identical to the observed transition matrix. For i, j = 1 . . . m, statistic of test 1 is χ 2 with m(m − 1) degrees of freedom, where m denotes the number of possible states  [AG57] . Probability p ij is empirically estimated by the ratio p ij = n ij /n i where n ij is the number of transitions from state i to state j and n i is the number of landscape units in the i state  [Ber88] . We use the same method of comparison for validation as for calibration: Markovian matrices with χ 2 test. The way we use calibration and validation for each kind of model is summarized in table 1. 
 Results As described in the methodology, we have first calibrated and validated an MCM in order to represent in a synthetic way, the dynamics of the land use transitions. The obtained matrix will be used to calibrate and validate the other two models: the TAM and the ABM. Validation by simulation on another set of data with the parameters adjusted by calibration. 
 ABM Global calibration difficult because parameters are too many. Partial calibration centered on time delays, using the adjusted parameters defined by timed automaton. Validation by simulation on another set of data with the adjusted parameters defined by timed automaton. 
 TAM calibration The timed automaton is calibrated and validated with the help of a Markov chain according to the χ 2 metric  [AG57] , from two samples of plots initially covered with forest and considered independent and not spatially localized. The timed automaton is calibrated by simulating during a 34 years with the first sample of historical transitions with 4 land use states and then validated during a 22 years with the second sample since forest clearing as to minimize the distance between two Markov transition matrices, which summarize the simulated and observed dynamics  [RHRM11] . The calibration of the timed automaton is the adjustment of the values of the four parameters of the transition rules, the time delays for crop, fallow and grass states and the number of crop/fallow cycles. Reiterative simulation is managed for each combination of four parameters in their intervals of possible discrete values (time delays). The adjusted parameters are those that minimize the distance between the two Markovian transition matrices, the observed and the simulated. The acceptance of fitted parameters is based on the results of the χ 2 test and our knowledge about farmer practices. The calibration results are shown in the figure 2; the resulting fitted parameters are given in the table 3. In the table 3, we also mentioned the statistics directly made on the observed time series. The histograms reveal that the probability distribution follows a decreasing exponential law of parameter λ. Therefore the mean σ is an estimation of λ (λ = 1/σ). The results were obtained by removing the last homogeneous sequence from each plot because it very often corresponds to a definitive abandonment into fallow or grass. By just calculating the median, we find almost directly the fitted parameters. Further work is necessary to better understand the small differences. The advantage of our method is to be completely independent of the kind of model we are calibrating and validating. The corresponding model is really used as a black box.    
 ABM setting and validation Calibration based of farm typology and decision rules for each agent would introduce many parameters, making very difficult any kind of calibration. It is the reason why we used an existing farm typology and the parameters fitted for the TAM to set the initial state of the ABM. Therefore, to set the ABM parameters, we used the time delays already fitted by timed automaton calibration, i.e. the time delays of three land use states, crop, fallow and grass and the number of cropping cycles. In the ABM, each agent is considered as a rule-based model, in conformity with its main objective and the respective times of cropfallow successions. The ABM uses also i.e. the parameters introduced by the farm typology. In reference to farm typology, we need 12 other variables to describe farm relation to forest corridor. These twelve variables are  (Table 4):  1) The three types of farm, 2) The corridor zones as defined by the distance from forest (three zones: savannah, forest border, forest), 3) Three land uses: paddy-field, crop and fallow. Note that grass land use state is not specified. Note that these land uses are the agricultural land uses, which include the three land use states of timed automaton model (land uses with transitions) and the paddy-field land use without transitions, 4) the number of plots by farm type and by corridor zone (3 types and 3 zones, generating 9 variables). These complementary variables are used to define the initial state of the model.  Table 4  shows the 12 additional variables to add to the 4 already defined time delays and crop intensity parameters. The calibration of a model with 16 variables is heavy and the protocol of calibration is not defined here. Obviously, it would need more detailed data. As the transition rules are the same for all farmers, the differences between farms are due to the number of plots (size) and the spatial plot distribution, and not to the time delays of the four selected parameters. The validation was achieved on the global result of the ABM, the land use landscape that results from the farm distribution and the farm strategies. The results are shown in the figure 5. H 0 approved at a 5% risk: no significative difference between both matrices 
 Discussion In Madagascar, forest conservation is viewed as a spatial protection of a specific forest territory. Our hypothesis is that farmer adaptation is mainly a spatial adaptation. A spatial typology has been built and tested by ABM on forest-agriculture transitions. This spatial typology does not validate the time delays. The parameters of this spatial typology are issued from field studies. These parameters have not been used in the ABM calibration but they are used to initialize this model. Thus the ABM is calibrated with the four fitted parameters issued from the TAM. Additionally, a Markov model has been used for calibration of the TAM and for both validations. The three kinds of models used in this modeling process are part of the ABM validation. Each one is dedicated to a particular kind of use. In order to make it explicit, we propose a set of descriptors to qualify these kind of models: the structure of the initial state, and the possible thematic objects  (table 6) ; the mathematical, computational and thematic objectives or questions, and their respective answers, relatively to hypothesis (mathematical and computational) or assumptions (thematic) (table 7); finally the calibration and validation process, and the used scenarios  (table 8) . 
 Conclusion Model validation is a complex process. It needs to define a protocol and intermediate steps. Progressive validation could be another but unexplored solution. Relatively to ABM validation, our proposal is to rely on one of the property of multi-agent systems, i.e. to produce a global phenomenon from local interactions. Therefore, its success relies on its ability to accurately produce this global phenomenon. Consequently, we proposed to describe the global dynamics using a Markov model in order to summarize it in a simple, stochastic, way. Comparing the global dynamics produced by the ABM simulation with the observed global dynamics allows to validate the model as being able to reproduce the targeted behavior. But it does not imply that the underlying local interactions are the right ones. It only implies that the hypotheses made at the local level do not contradict the globally observed behavior. However these local interactions themselves need to be calibrated and validated. Being, in principle, simpler than the complete ABM system, we used a third formalism, the timed automaton, in order to calibrate and validate the local behaviors (here, the transition rules). The general lesson learned from our proposed methodology is the usefulness of using a set of carefully chosen formalisms, and not only a single one, to deal with the various aspects of both the ABM and the targeted research questions. Having used three formalisms; the Markov chain, the timed automaton and the ABM, we proposed a synthetic analysis of the con-54 V2CS special issue of Studia Informatica Universalis   tribution of each of them for various questions to be answered around a complex model for both calibration and validation. The definition and realization of a global evaluation of an ABM simulation still leave a conceptual unsolved problem. Even if the desired global phenomenon is produced, the calibration of a large number of parameters at the local level remains to be done, as well as their validation. A method could be to validate individual strategies using the farm typology, and then the effect of the interactions (in our case the plots exchanges). However, it remains problematic with complex systems in general, where the global behavior is more than the sum of the individual ones.

As the collected data include annual plot use, the durations can be calculated for each land state.

In this zone, most humans live in rural settings and the development of more sustainable and profitable livestock and mixed-farming systems is mainly constrained by African animal trypanosomosis (AAT), transmitted by the riverine tsetse flies Glossina palpalis gambiensis Vanderplank and Glossina tachinoides Westwood  [1] . The Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomosis Eradication Campaign (PAT-TEC) recognised that, for tsetse eradication to be sustainable, it requires an area-wide approach where the control effort is directed against an entire pest population within a circumscribed area  [2] . Examples of successful and sustainable area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) campaigns against tsetse include the eradication of (i) Glossina pallidipes Austen from Zulu Land in South Africa  [3] , (ii) Glossina austeni Newstead from Unguja Island, Zanzibar  [2] , and (iii) Glossina morsitans centralis Machado from the Okavango delta in Botswana  [4] . All these areas are to date still tsetse-free. Whereas isolation is relatively easy to ascertain for islands populations, establishing the limits of target populations on mainland Africa is more challenging and modern tools of population genetics and remote sensing can greatly assist in that respect  [5, 6] . As riverine tsetse populations are mainly confined to suitable vegetation along the hydrological network in the subhumid savannah, it was suggested that the ''river basin'' could be used as the unit of operation in AW-IPM  [7] . This assumed that each primary river basin (and possibly also secondary and tertiary) contains tsetse populations that are geographically isolat-ed from those belonging to adjacent basins. However, whereas dispersal of G. p. gambiensis is mainly linear along the hydrological network during the dry season, flies can also disperse perpendicular to the river systems, especially during the rainy season, although accurate field data are scarce  [8] . To clarify the role of river basins in structuring tsetse populations, genetic studies were initiated in various areas in West Africa. These studies indicated considerable gene flow between riverine tsetse populations belonging to different river basins, and hence, these populations cannot be considered isolated  [9] [10] [11] . However, genetics can only give indirect indications that could be confirmed by directly measuring the potential of the flies to cross the watersheds between adjacent river basins. Here, we present the results of a releaserecapture study conducted to assist the planning of the PATTEC national project in Mali. Sterile G. p. gambiensis were released in tributaries of two river basins (Senegal and Bani), in close proximity to the adjacent basin (Niger). Attempts were made to recapture the released flies in the savannah between the river basins and, in one site, well within the adjacent river basin. The flies were sourced from the G. p. gambiensis colony maintained at the Centre International de Recherche-Développement Sur l'Elevage en Zone Subhumide (CIRDES), Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso since 1972. Flies were sterilised with a dose of 110 Gy in a 137 Ce source. Both sterile male and female flies were marked with a dot of acrylic paint on the thorax, with a different colour for each week. The flies were transported in carton release containers (dimensions 115690650 mm) at a density of 100 flies per box with chartered light aircraft from Bobo Dioulasso to Bamako, Mali, arriving at destination between 7:30 and 10:30 a.m. Upon arrival at the airport, the flies were immediately transported by car to the different release points (RPs). RP 1 and 2 were located on tributaries of the river Senegal and RP 3 and 4 on tributaries of the river Bani (  Figure 1 ). The RPs in the Bani basin were located 83 and 62 km from Bamako airport, and it took 2 h to reach each of them. The RPs in the Senegal basin were located 60 and 65 km from the airport, and it took, respectively, 2.5 h and 1.3 h to reach them. Fifty-six unbaited biconical traps  [12]  were deployed between 110 and 3,075 m from the RPs twice a week and collected after 48 h of trapping, for a period of 4 wk. Twelve, 15, 10, and 19 traps were deployed around RP 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. A total of 56,000 sterile flies were released at 7-d intervals from 20 July to 10 August 2004-that is, during the rainy season. At each date, 14,000 sterile flies were released, comprising 2,000 males and 1,500 females per site. As the daily catches were not collected by the field teams, no data are available to estimate the mortality of the released flies. We thus compared observations to the cumulative recapture rates at different distances from the release sites obtained by simulating a two-dimensional random walk with a daily displacement l between 100 and 1,000 m (increment of 10 m) and a constant mortality rate m of 0.1 (0.07-0.14) for the entire observation period (28 d). The confidence intervals below corresponded to the values giving the same maximal correlation coefficient using this mortality range. Similar mortality rates were observed for this strain of G. p. gambiensis in Burkina Faso  [13]  and Senegal  (Bouyer, unpublished data) . Then, we used the best estimation of l (estimated as the one maximising the correlation between observed and predicted probabilities) and a mortality rate closer to that of natural tsetse populations (0.02, C.I. 0.01-0.03)  [14]  to assess the mean dispersal distance by generation (mean of the absolute displacement of all individuals in the population), which can be compared to inferences made by population genetics methods (see  [13]  for details). During the entire monitoring period, a total of 589 sterile male flies (1.8% recapture rate) and 327 sterile female flies (1.4% recapture rate) were trapped. In addition, a total of 18 wild males and 16 wild females were caught (apparent density of 0.020 male flies/trap/d and 0.018 female flies/trap/d). Mean survival upon arrival at the RPs was 70% and 85% for the sterile male and female flies, respectively. Percentage of nonfliers were 0% and 7%, respectively. In one of the two sites where traps were placed also in the adjacent Niger basin (RP2), one marked female fly was recaptured on the other side of the watershed  (Figure 1 ). The estimations of l were very similar between batches and sites, but surprisingly, it was higher in females (mean 780 m, C.I. 760-910) than males (450 m, C.I. 440-670 m), corresponding to diffusion coefficients D of 0.304 km 2 /d and 0.101 km 2 /d (D = l 2 /2). With an average mortality rate of 0.02 (natural populations) and using the mean estimation of l, the calculated average dispersal distances were 1,268 m for female and 501 m for male flies. Since the average distance between the release point RP 2 and the traps deployed in the adjacent Niger Basin was ,3 km, the probability that one fly might reach one of the traps was 0.086, for l = 780 m and m = 0.1 (  Figure 2 ). As 5,179 flies were released in this site of which 41 flies were recaptured (0.8%), and with 7 of the 15 traps deployed on the other side of the watershed, it was expected to trap 1.66 flies at this side, which is close to the actual trap rate of 1. The data presented in this paper indicate that 110 Gy-treated flies (which can be considered of inferior biological quality as compared to their native counterparts) were capable of crossing the watershed between adjacent river basins in Mali. Although only one fly was recaptured in the adjacent river basin, it is proof of principle that G. p. gambiensis can disperse between river basins in Mali. The dispersal data are comparable to the measured diffusion coefficients in savannah areas, and flies were recaptured in traps deployed at 2 km distance from the river forest in Burkina Faso  [8]  and at <2.9 km from the release point in the present study (a female). The mean dispersal distances observed here are much higher than those estimated between river basins in Burkina Faso using population genetics (19-26 m)  [10]  but in line with those estimated from releaserecapture studies along the main Mouhoun river (153-1,053 m)  [13] . This is probably due to the fact that two different aspects were measured in the two studies: the dispersal of flies artificially released in unfavourable sites in the current study (as confirmed by the very low density of wild flies), which will induce the flies to disperse quicker to suitable sites for resting or larvipositioning, and the natural dispersal of flies in the previous studies. These data corroborate results from population genetics studies indicating that in West Africa G. p. gambiensis populations from different river basins cannot be considered isolated from one another. Barriers to prevent reinvasion would have to be established between eradication blocks should governments involved in the PATTEC initiative plan a sequential eradication strategy using the rolling carpet approach  [15] . It was previously reported that deltamethrin-treated biconical traps deployed at 100 m intervals in riparian forest along a 7 km river section prevented migration of G. p. gambiensis and G. tachinoides  [16] . More recently, insecticide-impregnated cloth targets deployed at ,250 m intervals forming a barrier with a width between 2 and 25 km successfully prevented reinvasion of G. m. centralis in the Okavango delta in Botswana  [4] . These barriers can be reinforced using insecticide-treated cattle  [17] . However, most of these barriers have been shown to have a very low temporal efficacy as they require proper maintenance, and in most cases, they have proven not to be sustainable  [18] . Barriers that are temporarily deployed to prevent reinvasion between intervention blocks to protect achievements made in each phase can be very valuable when used in eradication programmes that proceed in phases or blocks and that have a progressing eradication front. However, if an eradication strategy is not selected or not feasible, then a long-term suppression approach, where farmers themselves can apply control tactics such as localised insecticide treatment of cattle  [19] , is probably a good alternative to alleviate the burden of animal trypanosomosis. Further population genetics studies are being conducted across the entire G. p. gambiensis belt from Ghana to Senegal with a view to determining the most appropriate locations for establishing barriers to prevent reinvasion, taking into account the suitability and fragmentation of vegetation between the river basins.

It has become the main reason for liver transplantation in developed countries and represents an economic burden exceeding 1 billion US$ of direct health costs  [4, 5] . New estimates of the burden of disease suggest at least 185 million individuals worldwide to have been seropositive in 2005, with a tendency to increase  [6] . Treatment has considerably improved due to the optimization of antiviral regimens and the advent of new antiviral drugs  [7, 8, 9] . However, treatment in resource-limited settings is hardly accessible  [10] . The most effective instrument to prevent new infections with HCV would be a prophylactic vaccine. Unfortunately, chimpanzees are the only known animal species to adequately reflect human HCV infection  [11] . Vaccine development is hampered by the lack of a small animal model accessible at early stages of vaccine development  [12, 13] . Mice cannot be infected with HCV  [14] , but rats and mice engrafted with human hepatoma cells or transgenic for human CD81 and other co-receptor molecules have been proposed  [12, 15, 16, 17] . Mouse-adapted HCV has also been generated  [16, 18] . Still, these models are highly demanding from a technical point of view and reflect only parts of the pathogenesis and lifecycle of HCV, precluding their wide application  [12, 19] . A HCV-related hepacivirus of unknown origin, termed GBV-B, has been used as a surrogate model for HCV infection involving New World monkeys, where it causes hepatitis upon experimental inoculation  [20, 21] . The use of a surrogate model based on a related virus indicates a way to study HCV pathogenesis and immunity, even though neither monkeys nor apes are acceptable laboratory models in terms of accessibility and ethics  [12, 13, 22] . Non-Primate hepaciviruses related to HCV have also been detected in dogs and horses  [23, 24] . While horses cannot be considered as laboratory models, dogs at least have compatible body sizes. However, additional to ethical controversies, infected dogs showed grossly deviating pathology in that they appeared to have higher virus concentrations in respiratory specimens than in the liver  [23] . So far there is no evidence of antibodies against the virus in dogs, limiting their utility as a vaccination challenge model  [23, 24] . No hepaciviruses have been detected in other animals that could be kept in laboratories with reasonable effort, and under ethically acceptable conditions. The targeted identification of animal hepaciviruses might help elucidating the obscure origins of HCV and yield more accessible HCV surrogate models. We have recently demonstrated that the systematic investigation of small mammal reservoirs can yield novel viruses that are genetically closely related to human pathogenic viruses, such as the paramyxoviruses mumps and Nipah virus  [25] . Biological and ecological considerations direct research interests to animals with properties supportive of virus maintenance. The close social interaction of certain bat species forming large and dense social groups favors virus maintenance  [25, 26] . Virus spreading by bats may be facilitated by their migratory lifestyle, but also by human activities such as hunting of bats as bushmeat and human invasion of remote habitats  [27, 28, 29] . Several rodent species are also in focus as potential virus reservoirs, as they constitute habitat generalists and follow human civilization, providing opportunities for virus transmission  [30, 31] . Even though rodents form smaller social groups than bats, some rodent species have a high population turnover, which should enable efficient maintenance of viruses through the continuous replenishment of susceptible individuals  [26, 32] . Among terrestrial mammals, rodents and bats together constitute about two thirds of the 5,487 known mammalian species  [33] . Screening of wild mammals with a view on laboratory models should be oriented by criteria such as small body size and the ability to adapt to laboratory conditions, which applies to rodents, but not bats  [12, 34] . Here we have investigated 7,709 bats and rodents pertaining to 92 species sampled globally in ten tropical and temperate countries. The investigation was complemented by a comparison of virus diversity in 1,068 horses, cats and dogs. 
 Materials and Methods 
 Ethics statement All animals were handled according to national and European legislation, namely the EU council directive 86/609/EEC for the protection of animals. For all individual sampling sites, study protocols including trapping, sampling and testing of animals were approved by the responsible animal ethics committees as detailed below. All efforts were made leave animals unharmed or to minimize suffering of animals. Any surgical procedure was performed under sodium pentobarbital/ketamine anesthesia. Trapping of rodents in Germany was conducted in the framework of hantavirus monitoring activities and was coordinated by the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, the Federal Research Institute for Animal Health.

 Author Summary The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the most relevant causes of liver disease and cancer in humans. The lack of a small animal models represents an important hurdle on our way to understanding, treating, and preventing hepatitis C. The investigation of small mammals could identify virus infections similar to hepatitis C in animals that can be kept in laboratories, such as rodents, and can also yield insights into the evolution of those ancestral virus lineages out of which HCV developed. Here, we investigated a worldwide sample of 4,770 rodents, 2,939 bats, 210 horses and 858 cats and dogs for HCV-related viruses. New viruses were discovered in European bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and South African four-striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio). The disease in bank voles was studied in more detail, suggesting that infection of the liver occurs with similar symptoms to those caused by HCV in humans. These rodents might thus enable the development of new laboratory models of hepatitis C. Moreover, the phylogenetic history of those viruses provides fascinating new ideas regarding the evolution of HCV ancestors.  
 Sampling and RNA purification For all sampling and exportation of specimens, permission was obtained from the respective authorities (see Acknowledgement for individual permits). Animals were caught with mist nets, live or snap traps, identified by trained field biologists on site or prior to dissection (where applicable), euthanized and dissected in the respective laboratories. Canine, feline and equine samples were routine diagnostic specimens. Between 10-140 mL of blood were extracted using the Qiagen Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Approximately 30 mg of solid organ tissue were homogenized in a TissueLyser (Qiagen) and purified using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). 
 Hepacivirus detection and quantification Six nested PCR assays for amplification of hepacivirus RNA and two assays targeting the Flaviviridae sister-genera Flavivirus and Pestivirus were used to ensure broad detection. Highly sensitive HCV-specific assays targeting the X-tail, NS5B and 59-untranslated genomic regions were used in addition (see  Supplementary  Table S2  for oligonucleotide sequences and reaction conditions). RNA quantification relied on strain-specific real-time RT-PCR assays and photometrically quantified in vitro RNA transcripts generated as described previously  [35] . 
 Full genome sequencing No isolation attempts were made due to the small available specimen quantities and notorious difficulty of hepacivirus isolation. Instead, those rodent specimens with highest RNA concentrations were selected for full genome sequencing. Genomespanning islets were amplified by PCR using degenerate broadly reactive oligonucleotides  (Supplementary Table S2 ). Bridging strain-specific oligonucleotide primers (available upon request) were then designed to perform long range PCR using the Expand High Fidelity kit (Roche) on cDNA templates generated with the SuperScriptIII kit (Invitrogen). Some cDNA templates were enriched using a Phi29-based hexamer-driven amplification using a modified protocol of the Qiagen Whole Transcriptome Amplification kit (Qiagen) as described previously  [25] . Amplicons were Sanger sequenced using a primer walking strategy. The 59genome ends were determined using the Roche rapid amplifica-tion of cDNA ends (RACE) kit (Roche) generating contiguous PCR amplicons encompassing the complete 59-untranslated region (59-UTR) and the 59-terminus of the core gene. 454 junior next generation sequencing was used for confirmation of 59-UTR sequences. For determination of the 39-genome end, viral RNA was adenylated using a poly-A-polymerase (Clontech, Paris, France) followed by 39-RACE using the Invitrogen GeneRacer Kit (Invitrogen). 
 Phylogeny Bayesian tree topologies were assessed with MrBayes V3.1  [36]  using the WAG amino acid substitution matrix and BEAST V1.7.4  [37]  using the GTR model for nucleotide sequences and the FLU model for amino acid sequences. For MrBayes, two million MCMC iterations were sampled every 100 steps, resulting in 20,000 trees. For BEAST, 10,000,000 generations run under a strict clock were sampled every 1,000 steps, resulting in 10,000 trees. Burn-in was generally 25% of tree replicates.. A human pegivirus (previously termed GBV-C1; GenBank, U36380) was used as an outgroup. Maximum Likelihood analyses were used to confirm Bayesian tree topologies using the WAG amino acid substitution model and 1,000 bootstrap replicates in PhyML  [38] . Trees were visualized in FigTree from the BEAST package and Densitree  [39] . Folding RNA secondary structures in viral 59-and 39-genome ends were inferred manually basing on covariant base pairing and thermodynamic predictions using mfold  [40]  in an alignment of rodent, primate and canine/equine hepaciviruses generated with MAFFT  [41] . 
 Prediction of signal peptidase cleavage and N-/Oglycosylation sites Putative cellular signal peptidase (SP) cleavage sites were predicted based on artificial neural networks (NN) and hidden Markov models (HMM) using the SignalP 3.0 Server  [42] . N-and O-glycosylation sites were determined using the online tools NetNGlyc 1.0 Server and NetOGlyc Server  [43, 44] . 
 Genome comparison Putative genes were annotated based on predicted signal peptidase (SP) cleavage sites (where applicable) and sequence homology to HCV, GBV-B and canine/equine hepaciviruses. Alignments were generated using MAFFT  [41] . Amino acid percentage identity matrices were calculated using MEGA5  [45]  with the pairwise deletion option. 
 Statistics Comparison of mean virus concentrations was done using an ANOVA analysis with Scheffé post-hoc tests in the SPSS V20 software package (IBM, Ehningen, Germany). Cross-tables were done using EpiInfo7 (www.cdc.gov/epiinfo). 
 Serology HCV Western blot. Western blot (WB) analysis was performed with commercially available HCV strips (recomBlot HCV IgG 2.0 and recomLine HCV IgG, Microgen, Neuried, Germany). Bat and rodent sera were diluted 1:100 for screening. Horseradish peroxidase-labelled goat anti-bat immunoglobulin (Ig) conjugate (Bethyl, Montgomery, AL, USA) or goat-anti mouse Ig (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) were used as secondary antibodies (dilution, 1:500). For rodent WB, a tertiary horseradish peroxidase-labelled donkey-anti goat Ig (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) was used for signal amplification. Blots were evaluated following the manufacturer's instructions. HCV immunofluorescence assay. An indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was done using HCV-infected HuH7-cells (strain JC1) or replicon JFH1-transfected cells. Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%), permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 16PBS for 5 minutes and processed as described previously  [46] . Bat sera were diluted 1:50. Reactions were detected with goat-anti-bat Ig (Bethyl, 1:1000) and cyanine 2 (Cy2)-labelled donkey-anti-goat Ig (Dianova, 1:100). For control reactions, a polyclonal rabbit NS3-Ig raised against the NS3 helicase domain of JFH1 (1:400) and an Alexa 568-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit Ig (Invitrogen, 1:1000) were used. Rodent hepacivirus immunofluorescence assay. VeroFM cells were transfected in suspension using FuGENE HD (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) with 0.75 mg plasmid expressing the complete His-tagged NS3 proteins of the rodent hepaciviruses RMU10-3382 (rNS3RMU10-3382) and NLR-AP70 (rNS3AP70) and fixed 24 hours later with acetone/methanol (80%/20%). Myodes glareolus sera were tested at screening dilutions of 1:10 and 1:40. For secondary detection, a goat-anti-mouse Ig (Dianova, 1:2000) and a donkey-anti-goat cyanine 3-labelled Ig (Dianova, 1:200) were applied. Recombinant rNS3RMU10-3382 protein including a cleavable Thioredoxin/His 6 tag was expressed in bacteria and purified under non-denaturing conditions following a standard protocol  [47] . The untagged purified protein was used to produce specific rabbit polyclonal antisera at Thermo Scientific Pierce custom antibody service. Rabbit antiserum against rNS3RMU10-3382 (1:2000) was used in parallel to an rNS3RMU10-3382-reactive rodent serum (1:50) for a co-localization study by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Here, secondary detection was performed using a cyanine 2-labelled goat-anti rabbit Ig (Dianova, 1:200) and a cyanin 3-conjugated goat-anti-mouse Ig (Dianova, 1:200). 
 In-situ hybridization RNAScope RNA probes targeting a 978 nucleotide NS3 gene fragment of the M. glareolus clade 1 hepacivirus detected in specimen RMU10-3379 were custom designed by Advanced Cell Diagnostics (Hayward, CA, USA). RMU10-3379 was selected due to best tissue quality and high virus concentration. In-situ hybridization was performed as described by the manufacturer. 
 Accession numbers All virus sequences reported in this study were submitted to GenBank under accession numbers KC411776-KC411814. 
 Results Specimens from 8,777 individual animals from the orders Chiroptera, Rodentia, Carnivora and Perissodactyla were included in this study. The geographical origins of samples are summarized in  Figure 1AB . The sample contained sera and liver tissue from 4,770 rodents (Rodentia, 41 species), sera from 2,939 bats (Chiroptera, 51 species), sera from 210 horses (Perissodactyla) and sera from 167 dogs (Carnivora). Due to the reported respiratory tropism of canine hepaciviruses, snout swabs were additionally obtained from 239 dogs and 452 cats. The detailed composition of the sample is listed in Supplementary Table 1. 
 Pre-screening by serology Enough serum for serologic testing was available from 180 bats (72 Rousettus aegyptiacus and 108 Eidolon helvum) and 95 rodents (33 Myodes glareolus, 30 Apodemus sylvaticus, 30 Rattus norvegicus, 2 Myocastor coypus). In initial tests using immunofluorescence slides containing full recombinant HCV, 13 bats (7.2%, 9 R. aegyptiacus and 4 E. helvum) showed reactivity patterns suggestive of antibodies cross-reacting with HCV.  Figure 2A  exemplifies typical IFA reaction patterns observed. For confirmation, recombinant HCV western blot (WB) assays certified for diagnostic application in humans were adapted for use with bat and rodent sera. For 95 of the 180 bat sera, enough serum volume for WB testing was available. This included three of the 13 IFA-positive sera. As shown in  Table 1 , between seven (Core) to 28 (NS3/Helicase) sera were clearly reactive with different WB antigens. 10 sera (10.6%) were to be interpreted as antibody-positive upon criteria for the interpretation of western blot results applicable in human diagnostics.  Figure 2B  provides examples of typical reaction patterns. The three IFA-positive sera were also positive in WB. For rodents,  Table 1  shows that two (Helicase and NS4) to six (NS5B) sera reacted with individual antigens. Another 45 sera showed borderline reactivities comparable to the intensity of the WB cutoff control (examples of reactivities in  Figure 2C ). No rodent sera fulfilled the criteria for positive interpretation applicable in human diagnostics. 
 Hepacivirus detection For the molecular analysis of bats, 2,939 sera from Gabon, Ghana, Papua-New Guinea, Australia, Thailand, Panama and Germany were tested for Hepacivirus RNA using several broadly reactive and highly sensitive RT-PCR assays, as detailed in  Supplementary Table 2 . Despite the apparent relatedness of putative bat hepaciviruses with HCV suggested by the serologic analyses, no hepacivirus RNA was detected in any of the specimens, whereas several PCR fragments from the NS3 gene were obtained which upon sequencing were identified as pegiviruses related to GBV-D  [48] . Tested rodent specimens originated from Thailand, Gabon, South Africa, Germany, the Netherlands and Mexico (Supplementary  Table 1 ). HCV-related sequences from the NS3 gene were detected in 37 out of 4,770 specimens (0.8%). Ten of these findings were from South African four-striped grass mice (Rhabdomys pumilio; 10 of 518 individual animals, 1.9%). For these and all other positive specimens, a 978 nucleotide NS3 fragment was generated using additional primer pairs (Supplementary  Table 2 ). The derived sequences pertained to one clade, and were different from each other by 21.1% on nucleotide, or 3.4% on translated amino acid level. Twenty-seven (1.8%) of 1,465 individual bank voles (Myodes glareolus) from Germany and The Netherlands yielded HCV-related NS3 sequences. The derived sequences fell into two separate clades. Clade 1 contained 23 sequences different from each other by up to 15.8% of nucleotides and 2.8% of translated amino acids. Clade 2 contained four sequences different by 1.6% nucleotides and 0.6% translated amino acids. A Bayesian phylogeny of the partial NS3 gene shown in  Figure 3A  suggested that the M. glareolus hepacivirus clade 1 was monophyletic with HCV and the canine/equine hepaciviruses. M. glareolus hepacivirus clade 2 was most closely related to GBV-B while the R. pumilio-associated clade formed a sister taxon to all other hepaciviruses. An analysis of all replicate trees indicated that the deep phylogenetic nodes were not resolved (  Figure 3A ). The monophyly of HCV and the M. glareolus clade 1 hepaciviruses was maintained in 68.6% of tree replicates (3,430 of 5,000). In another 28.9% of trees (1,446/5,000), the two M. glareolus hepacivirus clades clustered together. Monophyly of all three rodent hepacivirus clades and GBV-B was indicated in only 15 of 5,000 tree replicates (0.3%). 
 Full genome characterization The near full genomes of five representative hepaciviruses from all rodent clades were determined, including two viruses from R. pumilio, two from M. glareolus clade 1 and one from M. glareolus clade 2 (identified by red squares in  Figure 3A ). The polyprotein genes were of different sizes including 2,781; 2,887; and 3,007 amino acid residues, respectively, compared to 3,008-3,033 in HCV. All genomes shared the typical hepacivirus polyprotein organization, encoding putative proteins in the sequence C-E1-E2-p7-NS2-NS3-NS4A/4B-NS5A-NS5B (  Figure 3B ). The putative structural C, E1, E2 and p7 proteins were predicted by signal peptidase cleavage site analysis (Supplementary  Table S3 ) to be comparable in their sizes to that of known hepacivirus proteins. Placentalia (Eutheria) evolutionary lineages according to  [76] . Major mammalian clades are identified at basal nodes of the Placentalia phylogeny: Afrotheria (e.g., elephants), Xenarthra, (e.g., anteaters) and Boreoeutheria, divided into the two superorders Euarchontoglires, (e.g., primates, rodents) and Laurasiatheria (e.g., dogs, bats). Sampled mammalian orders are shown in boldface type. Orders containing novel hepaciviruses identified in this study are shown in red and boldface. Orders with known hepaciviruses (perissodactyla, primates, carnivora) are given in red. Numbers of extant families and species per order adapted from  [33]   All rodent viruses had considerably fewer predicted glycosylation sites in their structural proteins, in particular their putative E2 proteins, as opposed to HCV. A detailed genome analysis is provided in  Figure 3B . The 59-terminus of the core gene of the R. pumilio hepacivirus clade contained a putative adenosine-rich slippery sequence at codons 10-14 (AAAAAAAACAAAAA, Supplementary  Figure 3B) . In HCV, a very similar sequence (AAAAAAAAAACAAA), located at nearly the same positions (codons 8-12) of the core gene induces production of a protein termed F in vitro due to ribosomal frameshift event  [49] . Depending on the HCV genotype, the size of the F protein ranges from 126 to 162 amino acid residues which vary considerably in sequence composition  [50] . The size of a putative F protein in SAR46 would be 65 amino acid residues and no homology to the HCV F proteins was observed. The total amino acid diversity of all homologous genes within the polyproteins of the three rodent hepacivirus clades was larger than that of all HCV genotypes (Supplementary  Table S4 ). Similar to HCV, the most variable genomic regions in rodent hepaciviruses were located in the Envelope E2 gene differing in up to 84.4% of encoded amino acids between the rodent virus clades; the NS2 gene differing in up to 79.8%; and the NS5A gene differing by up to 84.6%. The high degree of sequence homology of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes between all members of the family Flaviviridae enabled a more comprehensive comparison of the novel viruses. In a Bayesian phylogeny of these genes across the flavivirus family, the rodent viruses formed a monophyletic sister-clade to HCV (  Figure 4A ). Topological robustness was assessed by the fixation, in parallel Bayesian phylogenies, of two alternative topological hypotheses, the first involving monophyly of HCV with the canine/ equine viruses and M. glareolus clade 1, and the second assuming a separation of HCV and the canine/equine viruses from all rodent viruses and GBV-B. A Bayes factor test comparing the total model likelihood traces of these analyses indicated borderline-significant preference of the second hypothesis over the first (Log10 Bayes factor = 2.94).  Figure 4B  provides a comparison of RdRp-based amino acid distances within and between Flaviviridae genera. In a Bayesian phylogeny of the full polyprotein, the rodent hepaciviruses and GBV-B were monophyletic, forming a sister  Figure 2 . Serological reactivity of bat and rodent sera with HCV antigens. A. Indirect immunofluorescence assay using bat serum. Typical reactivity of a positive E. helvum serum from Ghana (GH69) diluted 1:50 in sample buffer with HuH7 cells infected with HCV strain JHF1 is shown on the left. Arrows point at specific staining of cytoplasmatic antigen. On the right, lack of reactivity of GH69 with uninfected HuH7 cells is shown. IFA was done as described in the methods section. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI. Scale bar represents 100 mm. B. HCV western blot reactivity patterns with bat sera. Representative reaction patterns of 11 bat sera with the HCV recomblot assay are shown. Sample 1, human positive control serum. Samples 2 to 12 correspond to the following bat species: 2-7, Eidolon helvum; 8-12, Rousettus aegyptiacus. C. HCV western blot reactivity patterns with rodent sera. Representative reaction patterns of 5 rodent sera with the HCV recomline are shown. Sample 1, human positive control serum. Samples 2 to 6 correspond to the following rodent species: 2, Rattus norvegicus; 3, Apodemus sylvaticus; 4, Myocastor coypus; 5, Rattus norvegicus; 6, Myodes glareolus. Blot antigens are indicated at the left of each row. Below each line in B and C, the result of a tentative evaluation is given following the manufacturer's criteria defined for human sera, as described below  Table 1  clade to the canine/equine hepaciviruses and HCV (  Figure 5) . The rodent-associated clade had very long intermediary branches and originated close to the root of all viruses. The full genome tree had a better phylogenetic resolution compared to the partial NS3 phylogeny, but still contained topological uncertainties in some deep nodes leading to rodent-associated taxa (Supplementary  Figure S1) . The genome ends of representatives of all three rodent viruses were determined, including virus RMU10-3382 belonging to M. glareolus clade 1, NLR-AP-70 belonging to M. glareolus clade 2, and virus SAR-46 belonging to the R. pumilio hepacivirus clade.  Figure 5  and Supplementary  Figure S2A  show that the 59genome terminus of RMU10-3382 contained structural elements typical of both pegi-and HCV-like internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs). Predicted structural similarities with the HCV-like IRES included the first stem-loop element (termed Ia and highlighted in orange in  Figure 5 ) and one of two sites involved in miRNA122 binding  [51] , while most of the remaining stem-loop elements (termed 3, 4 and 5 and highlighted in blue in  Figure 5 ) were more closely related to a pegivirus-like IRES. The 59-end of AP-70 was identical in structure to RMU10-3382 and contained only a few nucleotide exchanges. SAR-46 contained the typical HCV-like IRES structures including the characteristic stem-loop III (  Figure 5  and Supplementary  Figure S2B) . The observed structural similarity between the first stem-loop of all rodent viruses described here and the prototype hepaciviruses HCV and GBV-B consisted of a hairpin with a six-nucleotide stem and fourfive nucleotide loop. The equine/canine hepaciviruses contained a similar structural element located as their second predicted IRES domain, instead of the most 59-position this domain occupied in all other hepaciviruses. The RMU10-3382 and NLR-365 translation initiation sites contained a cytosine immediately following the putative start codon at position +4, which is suboptimal in the original Kozak sequence context (ACCATGG) but should not block initiation  [52] . The 39-ends of RMU10-3382 and SAR-46 contained three highly ordered stem-loop elements. In RMU10-3382, these RNA elements did not resemble any known 39noncoding sequence RNA structure. In SAR-46, the 39-terminal stem-loop structure, but not the preceding structures, resembled that of the HCV X-tail (  Figure 5  and Supplementary  Figure  S3) . A similar 39-terminal structure could be predicted for GBV-B, but not for the genetically related pegiviruses (  Figure 5  and Supplementary  Figure S4) . The 39-end of NLR-AP-70 could not be determined. Contrary to HCV and GBV-B, no poly-uracil stretch was observed in the rodent hepaciviruses. 
 Natural history of hepacivirus infection in bank voles Strain-specific real-time RT-PCR assays were used to determine viral RNA concentrations in tissues of 22 bank voles infected with clade 1 and 2 hepaciviruses. Mean RNA concentrations were highest in liver tissue (1.8610 8 copies/gram; range, 1.5610 6 -4.4610 9 ). These concentrations were significantly higher than those in other organs or serum (ANOVA, F = 7.592, p,0.0001;  Figure 6A  and Supplementary  Figure S5 ).  Figure 6B  shows M. glareolus clade 1 hepacivirus RNA stained by in-situ hybridization (ISH) in liver tissue. Foci of viral RNA were located in the cytoplasm of M. glareolus hepatocytes, while no staining was observed in RT-PCR-negative M. glareolus liver specimens (Supplementary  Figure S6  shows additional ISH details). Spleen, kidney, heart and lung tissues yielded no evidence of virus infection by ISH. Histopathological examination of eight RNApositive and two RNA-negative animals revealed low-grade focal lymphocytic invasion compatible with liver inflammation, such as shown in  Figure 6C  for two exemplary RNA-positive animals. Serological investigations in wild rodents were complicated by the fact that the vast majority of animals from virus-positive species were not live-trapped, therefore yielding no blood samples. Only post mortem peritoneal lavage fluids were collected from carcasses, but these were not qualified for serology. However, a subset of 97 live-trapped M. glareolus with appropriate blood samples were  
 Rodent species Myodes glareolus 33 0 Only weakly positive bands (visible, but weaker than the core antigen of the weak positive HCV control) were considered negative with the exception of the core antigen, which was then assigned 5 points. Blots were considered positive if the sum of points was equal to or greater than 10, borderline if the sum was between 6 and 9 points, and negative if the sum was equal to or below 5 points. Eight bat sera showing strongest Western Blot reactivity were end-point diluted to evaluate specificity of the reaction. Bands remained visible up to a dilution of 1:400. Some analyses were done using a follow-up version of the Microgen assay (recomline) with two separate core antigens and different interpretation criteria. Blots were then considered borderline if any two antigens showed higher intensity than a cut-off control, the helicase alone, the helicase and any NS antigen or any core epitope. Blots were considered positive in this assay version if both core antigens were positive, one core plus any other antigen or if three antigens showed higher intensities than the cut-off control. Reactivity of the secondary goat anti-mouse and tertiary donkey anti-goat antibodies used for rodent testing were controlled by using mouse anti-core and anti-NS3 monoclonal antibodies for primary reaction with blot antigens. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003438.t001 1 33 - - - 1 5 - 2 7 - - 2 - - - - Apodemus sylvaticus 30 0 1 29 - 1 - - 2 - 1 7 - - 4 - - 1 -

These were analyzed for antibodies against the Myodes hepacivirus clades 1 and 2 in an IFA using cells expressing the NS3 antigens of these viruses. Antibodies against the Myodes hepacivirus clade 1 NS3 antigen were found in eight animals (8.3%) at a median end-point titer of 1:200 (range, 1:100-1:1600). Antibodies against the Myodes hepacivirus clade 2 NS3 antigen were detected in 12 animals (12.4%) at a median end-point titer of 1:600 (range, 1:100-1:12800). The difference in antibody detection rates against clades 1 and 2 was not statistically significant (X2 = 0.5, p = 0.5). Myodes hepacivirus clade 1 antigen specificity was proven by counterstaining with a high-titered rabbit serum raised against the same recombinant NS3 antigen down to dilutions of .1:20,000. Myodes hepacivirus clade 2 antigen did not cross-react with this rabbit control serum even at high concentrations of 1:100, compatible with low NS3 amino acid sequence identity between the NS3 proteins of the two Myodes hepacivirus clades (42.4%, Supplementary  Table S4 ). Neither hepacivirus clade 1, nor clade 2 antibody-positive sera cross-reacted with HCV by immunofluorescence and by immunoblot, indicating specific immune reactions against the viruses studied (exemplary results in  Figure 6D ). This was compatible with low NS3 amino acid sequence identities between both Myodes hepacivirus clades and HCV, ranging from 37.9-42.2%  (Supplementary Table S4 ). Only one of the eight sera positive against M. glareolus clade 1 hepaciviruses also contained antibodies against M. glareolus clade 2 hepaciviruses (titers against clade 1 and clade 2 hepaciviruses were 1:200 and 1:3200, respectively). Additional highly sensitive real-time RT-PCR assays were designed specifically for the M. glareolus clade 1 and 2 hepaciviruses and used to analyze the association of viral RNA and antibody status in the 97 M. glareolus sera. No hepacivirus RNA was detected in any of the IFA-positive sera, neither with the broadly reactive screening assays, nor with the additional real-time RT-PCR assay. Therefore, another 239 RNA eluates still containing sufficient volumes to permit screening for M. glareolus clade 1 and 2 hepaciviruses were re-tested with the strain-specific real time RT-PCR assays. Another 57 specimens positive for clade 1 hepaciviruses (23.9%), but no additional clade 2 hepaciviruses were detected. Sera from these PCR-positive animals were obtained and tested for antibodies. Three of the 57 clade 1 RNA-positive sera contained antibodies against clade 1 hepaciviruses (5.3%). Because of previous reports of canine/equine hepaciviruses, all RT-PCR assays used in this study were also applied on specimens from horses, cats and dogs. No HCV-related sequences were found in any of the 858 canine or feline specimens. In seven of 210 horse sera (3.3%), sequences closely related to those equine hepaciviruses described previously from the US and New Zealand  [24]  were detected (9.5-15.0% exchanges in the 978 nucleotide NS3 gene fragment). Most of those nucleotide differences represented synonymous mutations, resulting in low amino acid distances of 0-1.2%. The novel hepaciviruses from German horses clustered phylogenetically with the previously described equine viruses (  Figure 3A ). 
 Discussion Here we found molecular evidence for viruses related to HCV in rodents. Rodent hepaciviruses were detected in four-striped grass mice from South Africa, as well as in bank voles from Central Europe. The latter have already been successfully bred under laboratory conditions, indicating an approach to establish surrogate models for hepacivirus infection  [53, 54, 55, 56] . All discovered viruses originated from deep nodes close to the bifurcations separating genera within the flavivirus tree. In phylogenies on whole genome and individual gene alignments, the novel viruses clustered in a monophyletic clade with previously known hepaciviruses and GBV-B. The clade is highly diversified with NS5b amino acid sequence distances between taxa ranging up to 66.1%, exceeding that in the well-studied genus Flavivirus (55.8%). Maximal distances within the genera Pegivirus (52.9%) and Pestivirus (42.0%) are even lower, suggesting a particularly high diversity to exist in a tentative genus defined by the novel clade. Whereas this indicates that some or all of the novel rodent viruses together with GBV-B might alternatively form an independent genus, recent descriptions of novel pegi-and pestiviruses in bats and swine suggest the diversity also within these genera to be understudied  [48, 57, 58] . Including the novel rodent viruses congeneric with HCV and canine/equine viruses, the minimal distance between the genera Hepacivirus and Pegivirus would be 73.5%. While this is lower than the 85-88% between other pairs of genera, it is consistent with a separation threshold of 72.2% between all members of the genus Flavivirus and Tamana bat virus, for which a separate genus has been proposed  [59] . This also corresponds to inter-generic distances within other well-studied families of plus-strand RNA viruses such as the Picornaviridae, whose twelve genera are mostly separated by 70-80% in the RdRp-encoding 3D gene  [60] . The   HCV 1a H77 (GenBank, NC_004102) . GenBank accession numbers of reference hepaciviruses are indicated to the right of taxon names. Tree topology was inferred using BEAST with a GTR nucleotide substitution model as described in the methods section. Rodent hepaciviruses from this study are shown in red and boldface, equine hepaciviruses from this study are shown in blue and boldface. Red squares indicate those viruses whose near full-length genomes were generated. Statistical support of grouping is shown as posterior probabilities at deep nodes. Scale bar corresponds to genetic distance. To the right, 5,000 tree replicates of the same analysis are rendered using Densitree (initial 5,000 trees discarded as burn-in). Green line color indicates low probability of all trees, line thickness corresponds to concordant topologies across tree replicates. B. Genome organization of the novel rodent hepaciviruses. Genes were annotated as described in the methods section. Black arrows on the top indicate predicted signal peptidase cleavage sites. Red arrows below indicate N-, blue arrows O-glycosylation sites. Putative gene starts and ends are numbered below polyprotein plots. HCV 1a strain H77 is depicted on top as a reference.

Statistical support of grouping from Bayesian posterior probabilities is indicated at node points. Scale bar corresponds to genetic distance. The Pestivirus BVDV (NC_001461) was chosen as an outgroup and truncated for graphical reasons. Branches leading to the novel hepaciviruses from this study are in orange. GenBank accession numbers of analyzed hepaciviruses correspond to those indicated in  Figure 3A . The 59-and 39-genome termini were re-drawn from published foldings for equine hepaciviruses  [24] , HCV  [63, 77]  and GBV-B  [78]  and de novo for this study for the  59-   The RNA-negative specimen RMU10-3187 from the same species was processed identically and is shown below as a control. Positive staining is visible as distinct red granules in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. Magnification was 1006, the inserts shows details of single hepatocytes in 106 higher magnification. Scale bars are shown to the lower right. C. Histopathology of M. glareolus liver specimens. Liver sections were stained by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and Epson van Giesson (EvG) stains. In H&E stains, black arrows point to inflammatory lymphocytic infiltrate. In EvG stains, black arrows highlight potential signs of fibrosis. Specimen 3180 shows intermediate portal inflammatory lymphocytic activity with potential low-grade fibrosis in a case with high hepacivirus RNA concentrations (1.5610 8 copies/gram). Specimen 1602 shows low-grade portal inflammatory activity and low-grade fibrosis in a case with high hepacivirus RNA genomic organization of the novel viruses provides additional criteria for tentative classification. Like all hepaciviruses and in contrast to all members of the genus Pegivirus, the novel viruses have a discernible core gene  [61] . In contrast to the genus Pestivirus  [62] , their genomes contained no putative N pro and E rns genes in any reading frame. Finally, in contrast to the genus Flavivirus  [63] , all rodent viruses showed IRES secondary structures in their 59genome termini. Some of the novel rodent IRES structures appeared to contain both elements related to type 3 IRES known from hepaci-and pestiviruses and type 4 IRES known from pegiviruses. Additionally, both M. glareolus rodent hepacivirus polyprotein clades were preceded by predominantly pegivirusrelated IRES structures, while the R. pumilio hepacivirus clade was preceded by a predominantly hepacivirus-related IRES. This may be compatible with ancient recombination events between Flaviviridae genera, a phenomenon known in the family Picornaviridae  [64, 65] . The genetic elements potentially homologous to HCV detected in rodent viruses also included microRNA-122 binding sites in the 59-ncr, an X-tail-like element in the 39-terminus and a putative F gene in an alternative open reading frame (ORF) of the R. pumilioassociated virus. The F protein appears to be unessential for HCV replication, but the evolutionary conservation of its ORF suggests that it may play a critical regulatory role in virus propagation and survival  [50] . In this regard, the F protein may be considered a counter-defensive security protein that evolved to overcome mechanisms of host resistance  [66] . The absence of paramount features typical of other genera and the presence of hepaciviruslike features suggest a tentative classification of the novel rodent viruses within the genus Hepacivirus, rather than a novel genus. Within the genus, phylogeny suggests early divergence of ancestral rodent viruses from a lineage leading up to HCV and canine/equine hepaciviruses. Weakness of resolution in deep bifurcations of the NS3 gene phylogeny and lack of any highly significant preference for deep topological hypotheses in the NS5B gene phylogeny underline the ancestral origin of these viruses. Within the current dataset we can consider them equidistant from HCV and the canine/equine hepaciviruses, suggesting existence of independent taxonomic entities. HCV is one viral species whose genotypes are separated by more than 30% genomic nucleotide distance  [67] , which corresponds to about 22-31% AA distance. Different species within the related sister genus Pegivirus, such as GBV-C and GBV-A, are separated from each other by about 45% AA distance  [68] . Within the Genus Flavivirus, well-defined species such as dengue virus 1, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus and tickborne encephalitis virus are separated from each other by 48-60% AA distance. Comparing these values we could putatively assume that both Myodes-associated clades distant from each other by 70% AA sequence, as well as the Rhabdomys-associated clade separated from both of the aforementioned by 66-69% AA sequence, might form three distinct species. The canine/equine hepacivirus clade separated from HCV by 52-53% AA sequence would then also form a separate species. Furthermore, all rodent hepacivirus clades and specifically M. glareolus hepacivirus clade 2 were slightly more related to GBV-B than to HCV. GBV-B causes hepatitis in experimentally infected New World primates but not in humans and chimpanzees  [61] . The true host of this virus is unknown, but our findings suggest that GBV-B might originate from rodents. Nevertheless, the genetic distance of GBV-B even to its closest relative, the Myodes hepacivirus clade 2 (63% AA sequence), suggests GBV-B to remain a solitary representative of a separate species of hepaciviruses. In the canine/equine clade (also termed non-primate hepaciviruses or NPHV  [23] ), it is striking that almost identical viruses have been found in horses and dogs. Additionally, horses but not dogs had antibodies against those viruses  [24] . In the present study we augmented the number of studied dogs and horses considerably, and investigated cats in addition as these are related in the order of carnivores and have shared domestic habitats with dogs over a long history. The complete absence of viruses in cats and dogs, and the confirmation of highly similar viruses in other geographic regions, here and in another recent study  [69] , suggest an actual equine association of the canine/equine clade. Whether acquisition of viruses might have occurred during the domestication of horses, or whether a more generic viral association with the equine stem lineage may exist, could be clarified by testing nondomestic equids such as wild asses or zebras. However, the overall phylogenetic position and monophyly of equine viruses suggest no role as ancestral hepacivirus hosts for horses. While the rodent hepaciviruses greatly extended the genetic diversity of the genus Hepacivirus, their role in the evolution of HCV precursors, if any, remains to be determined. Our serological evidence for hepaciviruses in bats is noteworthy even in absence of direct virus findings. Viruses from all Flaviviridae genera including Pegivirus, Pestivirus and Flavivirus have already been found in bats  [48, 70, 71] . We could not exclude that the antibodies in bat sera reacting with HCV antigens were directed against viruses from other Flaviviridae genera, rather than bat hepaciviruses. However, there was no cross-reactivity between the NS3 proteins of the more closely related canine/equine hepaciviruses and HCV  [24] . Similarly, the two bank vole hepacivirus clades from our study showed no serologic cross-reactivity. These data can therefore serve as very initial suggestions for the existence of bat hepaciviruses only. It should be noted that the degree of genomic similarity necessary for serologic cross-reactivity should have permitted RNA detection by the broadly reactive PCR assays used in this study. Whether bat hepaciviruses indeed exist will therefore require further evidence. A first step to this direction may be an analysis of an expanded bat sample by using the methods presented here. Additional to phylogeny and genomic properties, the novel viruses resemble HCV in important traits of the natural history of infection. The detection of non-identical virus sequences in natural groups of animals, in combination with specific antiviral antibodies, proves continuous transmission of virus among animals. Induction of controlled infections in housed animals should thus be feasible. We found clear in-vivo evidence for hepatic tropism by demonstrating histopathological signs of liver inflammation, concentrations (3.4610 8 copies/gram). Specimen 3187 shows no significantly increased inflammatory activity and no signs of fibrosis in a case with no detectable hepacivirus RNA. Due to highest tissue quality, a terminal hepatic venule instead of a portal triad is shown. D. Recognition of rodent hepacivirus clade 1 antigens by M. glareolus serum. VeroFM cells expressing complete NS3 from M. glareolus hepacivirus RMU10-3382 (GenBank, KC411777) were incubated with 1:2000-diluted rabbit-anti-NS3 3382 antiserum (control) or 1:50-diluted rodent serum (picture shows exemplary results for animal NLR 3/C12), followed by goat-anti-rabbit-Cy2 (green) and goat-anti-mouse-Cy3 (red) secondary immunoglobulins. For colocalization analysis of fluorescence signals, the 6th of 12 1-mM Z-stags is shown for every channel. Cross-reactivity with HCV antigens was analyzed by incubation of HuH7 cells, transfected with HCV replicon JFH1, with a rabbit-anti-human-HCV-NS3-49 serum, diluted 1:400 (control) or rodent serum NLR 3/C12 diluted 1:50, followed by goat-anti-rabbit-Cy2 (green) and goat-anti-mouse-Cy3 (red) secondary antibodies. Counterstaining was performed using DAPI. Bar, 25 mm. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003438.g006 excessive viral RNA concentrations in the liver, as well as in-situ hybridizations demonstrating intracellular genome replication in liver cells of bank voles. A somewhat lower degree of hepatic inflammation compared to that in some HCV-infected humans might be due to the shorter life span of bank voles rarely exceeding 1-2 years in the wild, or due to a higher capacity of tissue regeneration  [72, 73] . Interestingly, our serological investigations suggested bank voles might be able to clear hepacivirus infections, as antibodies did not co-occur with RNA in most, but not all animals  [1] . Bank voles may therefore be more capable of clearing hepacivirus infection than humans. This would be compatible with infection patterns also observed in other Flaviviridae members, exemplified by the flavivirus West Nile virus in rhesus macaques, the pestivirus BVDV1 in cattle and the hepacivirus GBV-B in experimentally infected tamarins  [61, 74, 75] . However, it would differ from equine hepaciviruses, in which RNA and antibodies cooccurred  [24] . Controlled infection experiments in bank voles might yield relevant scenarios for the study of HCV persistence. Bank voles can be kept in the laboratory with comparatively little effort and have been used for virus infection studies, e.g., with herpesviruses, bornaviruses, hantaviruses, and flaviviruses  [53, 54, 55, 56] . Efforts to establish bank vole infection models may benefit from the discovery of two highly divergent clades in this species. Knowledge of three full genomes in total should enable efficient rescue of virus from cDNA. Notably, the Rhabdomys-associated virus clade has a host in even closer relationship (on subfamily level) to Mus musculus commonly kept in laboratories, for which powerful technologies such as gene knock out and in-vivo imaging exist. Also for this virus clade, two different full genomes have been determined. In the present study focusing on viral ecology, however, we have not conducted infection or virus rescue trials in cell cultures or animals. Due to the strict liver tropism those viruses can be expected to be as difficult to cultivate as HCV, and we currently lack any possibilities to generate primary Myodes hepatocytes. The housing of those animals is in preparation, as are attempts to rescue fully sequenced viruses by reverse genetics. Additionally, our finding of presence of hepaciviruses in the Murinae subfamily have triggered more targeted ecological investigations to potentially identify viruses from hosts in even closer relationship to Mus musculus. The availability of rodent surrogate models of HCV infection may obviate one of the most critical obstacles to HCV vaccine development by obviating the need for primate experiments in early stages of experimentation  [12, 34] .  Figure S1  BEAST polyprotein phylogeny including the novel rodent hepaciviruses. The complete polyprotein sequence of all hepaciviruses was analyzed in BEAST  [37]  using the FLU amino acid substitution matrix and a strict clock over 10,000,000 trees sampled every 1,000 generations. After exclusion of 2,500 trees as burn-in, all trees are depicted using Densitree  [39] . Blue color corresponds to most probable topologies, red to second-best, green to third-best and dark green to remaining topologies. First round RT-PCR reactions were used a touchdown protocol with reverse transcription at 48u for 30 minutes, denaturation at 95u for 3 minutes, followed by PCR 10 cycles of 15 sec at 94uC, 20 sec at 60uC with a decrease of 1uC per cycle, and extension at 72uC for 45 seconds, followed by another 40 cycles at 50uC annealing temperature. Second round reactions used the same cycling protocol without the RT step. RNA quantification was performed in 25 mL reaction volumes using the SSIII One-Step RT-PCR system (Invitrogen) as described above with 300 nmol/L of respective forward and reverse primers and 200 nmol/L of respective probes. Amplification involved 15 min at 55uC; 3 min at 95uC; 45 cycles of 15 sec at 94uC, and 25 sec at 58uC. Fluorescence was measured at the 58uC annealing/extension step. Published assays from which oligonucleotide primers were used in this study included  [35, 79, 80, 81, 82] .

GenBank accession number of NLR-AP70 representing M. glareolus hepacivirus clade 2 is KC411784. The structural genome region included Core (C), Envelope 1 and 2 (E1 and E2) and p7 genes. The boxes in the HCV and SAR-46 Core gene indicate a putative F protein open reading frame. The putative Core gene at the N9-terminus of the rodent hepacivirus polyproteins included a high number of strongly basic lysine and arginine residues (M. glareolus clade 1, 29 of 163 residues (17.8%); M. glareolus clade 2, 23 of 149 (15.4%); R. pumilio clade, 28 of 172 (16.3%); compared to 31 of 191 (16.2%) in HCV-1a and 11 of the N9-terminal 200 residues (5.5%) in the pegivirus GBV-C1 not encoding a Core protein. Non-structural genes included an NS3 protease/helicase gene, the phosphoprotein NS5a and the NS5b gene encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Within the NS4 gene, only the NS4b portion could be clearly identified for all viruses. An NS4a homologue could only be detected in virus SAR-46. IRES types and structural elements in the 39-genome ends are depicted adjacent to the polyprotein plots for viruses NLR-3382 and SAR-46. Of NLR-AP70, only the 59-end could be partially determined. This sequence was almost identical to RMU10-3382/NLR-365. The 39-terminus of NLR-AP70 could not be determined. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003438.g003

Despite earlier attempts to fold the 39-ncr of GBV-B [21] only the 39-terminal stem-loop structure of GBV-B could be reliably folded due to the single sequence available. The folding of the 39-end of RMU10-3382 remained tentative for the same reason.

Wageningen : CTA, p. 97-104.",22,20140804,7 .IntroducingARProotedin partnership:theUnaiproject inBrazil,,"The main produce of these family farms is milk. Most of the newer farms are undertaking measures to increase milk production: improvement of pastures and fodder systems, acquisition of better animal stock, and installation of chilling tanks. The main crop in the area, maize, suffers from problems of soil preparation, seed quality, and control of weeds, but it exhibits great potential including as a fodder resource (silage). It is in this context that Embrapa and the University of Brasilia (UnB) launched a participatory development-research project in 2002. Its aim was to provide support to family farms created from agrarian reform. Cirad became involved in the project in 2004. The project concentrated on four major axes: -Developing technical-economic references on production systems; -Promoting the insertion of farms into markets; -Building the capacities of farmer associations; -Training young rural agents of development originating from agrarian reform. 
 Stakeholders and origin of the approach The UnB-Embrapa research team first entered into a partnership with farmer associations in three settlements of agrarian reforms and their district union which was very active in the struggle for land reform. It also entered into separate agreements with the Minas Gerais Company for Technical Assistance and Rural Extension and the Unai Agricultural School. Based on participatory diagnosis and formulation of action plans negotiated with each association, this approach relied above all on the resolve of the researchers. It produced concrete results for the farmers: ""Thanks to this research, we now know how to improve the quality of our milk."" Or, ""With direct seeding, we can now plant maize or beans without the fear that there will be nothing to harvest."" But the amount of time researchers spent in supporting and participating in the farmers' activities led to a reduction in their time for producing generic knowledge. Other limitations came to the fore when farmer associations and local authorities asked researchers to change the scale of their intervention: to go from the original 3 settlements to encompass all 25 settlements in the Unai district. There were two primary concerns in this potential expansion: -How to work with farmer associations and development agents to best meet the demands of the district union and the associations? -How to structure an action-research approach which tackles innovation both in its technical aspects as well as in its organizational ones? 
 Reflections on the degree and type of involvement These two questions formed the starting point for reflections on how the ARP approach could make useful contributions without actually trying to recast the entire Unai project around it. In reflecting about ARP, research topics and questions were identified for which researchers considered that contributions from farmers and agents of development would not only be useful but even crucial in resolving problems identified during the earlier diagnoses. On the face of it, a strengthened partnership should have helped save time, arrive at results most suited to both the diverse and specific conditions reigning in the area under study, and facilitate local appropriation in view of the proposed change in scale (learning, training, information, and disclosure). Finally, the requirements proposed under the ARP framework of formalizing the partnership and clarifying the approach seemed to offer the benefit of helping to clarify the roles of different partners and to empower the local stakeholders, in particular the farmers and their associations. ""These researchers take the time to explain their methods, even practically, to us. Those earlier ones wouldn't even get out of their vehicles.... These explain everything to us."" ""One day the project will conclude. For some of us it will be more difficult than for others. But we will be able to progress even without the researchers."" The ARP's place in the project was gradually defined, and an ""ARP collective"" constructed, via four workshops centered on exchanges of experiences and methodological training in the principles of action research. The first was held in end-2005, the last in mid-2007. The first one, at the end of 2005, brought together researchers from Embrapa, Cirad, and UnB; and teachers from UnB and the Unai agricultural school. It focused on the need of formalizing and structuring the partnership and on the necessity of helping farmers become true interlocutors. The ARP approach and its monitoring methods were then tested for setting up new activities related to direct seeding, a new type of cropping systems being developed within the framework of the Unai project. The second workshop, in May 2006, brought together representatives from 15 village associations and the Unai district farmers' union; and the research and teacher teams. The farmers made two key requests: getting proper access to technical support and extension, and insertion into markets: ""All these diagnoses are all well and good, but something practical has to come out of them; we need technical support. We are quite capable of production. The big problem is of selling our produce."" These requests led to a series of joint actions by mixed commissions consisting of farmers, researchers, and trainee technicians: monitoring and negotiation of the price of milk and the setting up of a team of technicians embedded with the farmers' union. The third workshop, at the end of 2006, was focused on the articulation of the activities of the researchers and those of the young technicians originating from the settlements. Responding to the needs of the local organizations, these technicians were in a position to form technical assistance teams and even to expand their activities beyond their immediate environment and change the scale of their intervention. The final workshop, in June 2007, brought together farmers, technicians, and researchers to analyze the functioning of thematic groups (focus groups) which had been formed in earlier years on different issues (milk, direct-seeding, processing and marking of indigenous fruits) and to capitalize on the critical evaluation of the various experiences. It helped deepen the understanding of key ARP concepts (empowering, formalizing, imparting autonomy) and to incorporate them into these focus groups. These workshops were complemented and supported by various training and information sessions on the management of directseeding cropping systems. These sessions were organized every year and included field visits, technical demonstrations, reciprocal visits to farmers' experiments, and external study tours. ""For a farmer, grand theories mean little, but when we see things implemented in the field and can discuss them with other farmers and technicians, then we understand much faster."" 
 Activities conducted as part of action research in partnership Reflections carried out on the ARP led to the introduction of new activities into the project: -Construction of questions that were common to researchers, technicians, and farmers, mainly on direct-seeding systems, but also on the marketing of milk, technical support and assistance, and other topics; -Organizing discussion sessions on the character and evolution of the partnership and on each partner's specific role, especially as relating to experimental set-ups on direct seeding and to focus groups on ""direct seeding"" and ""promotion of local fruits."" -Establishing an experimental network for direct seeding. It consisted of on-farm and on-station trials and revolved around the setting up and monitoring of three ""direct-seeding"" focus groups; -Reflexive analysis of research-development approaches and methods based on observations and interviews. 
 Some results obtained Reflecting on the partnership helped participants make the distinction between partner institutions (research, farmer associations, agricultural school) and institutions that collaborated only when necessary (extension service, district government, milk cooperative, Unai technical faculty). It also helped clarify the allocation of roles, division of responsibilities, and the decision making process. Its most direct impact was that it clarified the roles and functions of researchers in their interaction with the other stakeholders. Consequently, today researchers are conscious of maintaining the necessary and difficult balance between knowledge creation and involvement in action. They recognize that they can no longer play the multiple roles they did in the initial project phase. Asymmetries also started to be reduced. Researchers had enjoyed, from the very beginning, the upper hand in managerial matters and in financing the various activities. They were thus rule makers, for example, deciding who could call meetings and who would manage them. It was only natural for farmers to consider them decision makers (""the powerful ones"") and the source of information and services. Goodwill alone does not overturn easily established routines. Nor is it easy to reduce and then reverse a fundamental asymmetry by introducing concepts and practices of a more balanced partnership and assigning responsibility and granting independence to the other actors -farmers and agents of development. A tremendous effort is required to socialize objectives and methods, as well as to adopt transparent and negotiated mechanisms to divide work and responsibility. The four-step training helped reduce asymmetries. Bringing together widely disparate stakeholders for training helped construct a viable partnership. In addition, these specific training sessions helped build the capacities of the weakest stakeholders, the farmers and young technicians, so that they were better prepared to interact with other stakeholders, be they politicians, technical and administrative services, cooperatives, or businesses. But progress on these various fronts was only achieved up to a point. ""Amongst us, we are not shy to speak up. But in front of technicians and politicians, we daren't open our mouths."" Also imparting training step-and topic-wise requires a multiplication of training events. Thanks partly to ARP, researchers adapted the work calendar as best as they could to the farmers' schedules. Some researchers did not want to or could not work on Saturdays and Sundays, even though those were the days often selected for meetings of farmer associations, for holding local markets, and other events. Farmers, on their side, were not always available to meet researchers and were afraid of losing too much time in meetings. A compromise was found to arrange meetings at noon or in the early afternoon, after the lunch break and during the hottest period of the day. Some activities, such as field trips or meetings with all members of the associations were scheduled specifically over the weekend to allow the maximum number of farmers to attend. The researcher-farmer dialog and the work methodology relating to direct-seeding cropping systems were reviewed. Farmers and researchers validated several different types of technical references coming out of the experiments. Tests in farmers' fields were complemented by tests in controlled environments at the agricultural school, by reciprocal visits, by thematic training, and by monitoring and evaluation which led to collective back reporting with the members of focus groups or the community. Some routine activities implemented in earlier stages, like the monthly monitoring of a network of reference farms, were gradually eliminated. This freed up time for monitoring experiments and thematic focus groups. The existence of focus groups as merely practical contact groups for meetings called and organized by the researchers was seriously called into question. Efforts invested in reflexivity about the approach helped show the limitations of the existing set-up, in particular the limits of participatory methods, poorly understood or perceived by the farmers. They helped redefine the modalities of training and to suspend, for the time being, the plan to expand the approach to the entire Unai district until the various stakeholders, researchers included, were truly ready to tackle such a scale. 
 Summary The Unai project is a good example of a situation where research intent met the will to change. Highly committed researchers saw how they could make their profession more effective and meaningful if they modified their roles to fit the three ARP objectives: resolving problems, generating knowledge, building autonomy. The sequence of progressive training sessions played a key role in transiting from a development-research approach to that of an ARP. Self-analysis of project stakeholders' practices, of the processes for cobuilding set-ups and activities, and of the results, along with theoretical inputs on action research, helped facilitate the sharing of knowledge while developing team cohesion around shared principles and values. Whenever necessary, facilitators did not hesitate to shake the local stakeholders or to push researchers out of their scientific entrenchments. Such a contribution was particularly significant. Facilitators insisted on the different visions of each group: ""What does direct seeding mean for you?"" or ""What, according to you, constitutes a good focus group?"" They drew up possible scenarios and simulated the ARP's method of functioning out of everyday professional situations. Deceptively simple questions powered the dynamics. For example: ""Why are we organized in this manner?"" or ""How do the experiments we are conducting or the negotiation strategy we are implementing to improve the quality and price of milk contribute to empowering farmers or modifying their usual role?"" Finally, the planning and conduct of the training sessions in full partnership also contributed significantly to this transition. Four verbs describe succinctly the takeaways from the use of ARP in the Unai project: empower, formalize, define the roles, negotiate. 
 Conclusion Building the ARP collective is a critical stage. It is closely interlinked with the collective construction of the problem set and impacts the collective's ability to resolve it. An ARP project's proponents, whether they be researchers or not, have to enroll individuals and institutions. While it is normal to take the representativeness, legitimacy, and expertise of the participating stakeholders into account, it is strategically important to also consider the pre-existing relationships between them, their power relationships and alliances, and explicit or hidden motivations -to the extent that these can be deciphered at this early stage. Building a collective takes time and the ability to listen. It also requires measures to facilitate dialog and to kick start the first concrete actions. The functioning of an ARP collective shows that partners must share a minimum level of values while recognizing differences that may exist between them. It is also important that asymmetries relating to material or non-material resources, in particular between social groups on the one hand, and between researchers and the other stakeholders on the other, be managed by building trust, relying on explicit rules, and by mobilizing acknowledged mediators. The researcher has a unique place in an ARP. He or she is often one of the initiative takers of the ARP project and participates actively in defining its problem-set. Sometimes, researchers will even manage the process itself. He or she will have to make a special effort to maintain a balance between involvement in the activities with stakeholdersreflecting a proximity to some of them, or even at times a connivanceand the detachment necessary to dispassionately analyze the processes in progress and to formalize rigorous results. Researchers do not necessarily, by themselves, think of explaining their motivations to the rest of the collective; they have to make an effort to do so. Finally, difficulties may arise and tensions may be provoked as some research hypotheses are not always shared or as publication of results in articles have not been sufficiently discussed beforehand. 			 .IntroducingARProotedinpartnership:theUnaiprojectinBrazil 99

Il a été favorisé en périphérie dans les grandes villes marocaines par des mesures de dérogation qui permettent de contourner la loi 12.90 relative à l'urbanisme comportant des mesures de protection des terres fertiles . Les espaces périurbains ont généralement de grandes potentialités agricoles car historiquement les populations s'installent et bâtissent leurs territoires sur les terres les plus fertiles. Aujourd'hui, les bâtisseurs recherchent des terrains plats en périphérie des villes facilement constructibles et donc réduisant les coûts d'aménagement et de construction comme c'est le cas au sud de la ville Meknès depuis les années 1990. Cette zone est dominée par les terres de la réforme agraire. Ainsi l'urbanisation en périphérie de Meknès a aussi été favorisée à partir de 2005 par la mesure de la mainlevée qui permet de donner un statut melk aux terres agricoles de la réforme agraire, qui peuvent alors être vendues . Dans une moindre mesure le dispositif de cession des terres collectives par leurs ayants droit à l'Etat a aussi permis d'affecter des terres à des projets immobiliers  (Daoudi 2011) . Mais ces espaces périurbains ont largement participé dans le passé et dans une moindre mesure aujourd'hui, à l'approvisionnement de la ville en produits frais (lait, fruits et légumes) du fait de leur proximité avec les lieux de commercialisation et de consommation. Ces espaces sont donc sources de revenus et d'emplois pour les populations périurbaines. Dans ce contexte, les différentes formes d'agriculture périurbaine qui existent aujourd'hui jouent un rôle économique, social et environnemental important (ouverture et maintien du paysage, entre autres) et peuvent constituer une barrière à l'étalement urbain dont les coûts récurrents sont considérables pour la cité (transport, adduction d'eau, …). Dans ces espaces transitoires, qui constituent une limite floue entre l'urbain et le rural, on rencontre à la fois des zones de cultures intensives souvent de maraîchage, des zones de cultures extensives en bour, de l'élevage et des friches. Mais le changement de vocation des terres avec la construction de logements ou de bâtiments à usage économique entraine une importante spéculation foncière. Dans ce contexte les agriculteurs familiaux qui veulent continuer leurs activités de production doivent développer des stratégies spécifiques. Cette étude réalisée dans le cadre du projet DAUME «Durabilité des Agricultures Urbaines en Méditerranée» vise à expliciter ces stratégies adaptatives en considérant deux types de questions : -Quelle est la diversité des exploitations familiales en zone périurbaine ? -Quelles sont les stratégies foncières et technico-économiques mises en oeuvre par les agriculteurs périurbains qui veulent se maintenir dans ce secteur d'activité ? 
 Méthode et contexte Pour cette étude la commune urbaine de Sebaa-Ayoune, située en périphérie Est de Meknès (figure 1), a été choisie parce qu'elle connait un développement agricole ancien (agro-industrie, viticulture) et une urbanisation rapide ces dix dernières années. Cette situation constitue un cas d'école de confrontation entre la poursuite d'un développement économique agricole d'une part et l'urbanisation et la spéculation foncière, d'autre part. Sebaa-Ayoune est située à une dizaine de km de la commune urbaine d'Ouislane, partie prenante de l'agglomération de Meknès. Le taux de croissance annuelle moyen de sa population est le plus élevé de la province (3,3%). Cette commune est passée depuis l'Indépendance d'une petite bourgade rurale de moins de 1 000 habitants à une commune urbaine d'environ 27700 habitants aujourd'hui  (Lahlou, 2011) . 
 Urbanisation sur des terres planes et fertiles à Meknès Face à cette pression urbaine, le prix du foncier à Sebaa-Ayoune connait une hausse depuis plusieurs années car les promoteurs immobiliers, les intermédiaires ou des spéculateurs cherchent à acquérir des terres principalement dans la zone constructible de la commune mais aussi le long des axes de circulation. En effet, selon nos enquêtes, le prix de l'hectare ne dépassait pas 200 000 Dh 1 il y a une dizaine d'années. 1 11 Dh = 1 Euro. Actuellement, les terres agricoles 2 sont vendues en règle générale entre 300 000 à 600 000 Dh/ha voire plus. Toutefois cette commune urbaine garde une forte spécialisation agricole : 1850 ha cultivables relevant de l'agriculture familiale s'ajoutent aux 1300 ha des grandes entreprises soit 78% de la surface de la commune qui compte en tout 4 120 ha. 210 exploitations agricoles dont plus de 95% sont de type familial et 150 ayant moins de 10 Ha, se caractérisent par une production diversifiée : maraichage, lait, arboriculture, céréales, élevage bovin (Monographie du Centre des Travaux d'Ain Taoujdat, 2010). Le statut foncier des terres se répartit entre le Melk (66%), le domaine privé de l'Etat (17 %) et la réforme agraire (17%). Actuellement, avec la mesure de la mainlevée, une grande partie des terres de la réforme agraire est «melkisée» (quelques exploitations sur les 53 exploitations de la réforme agraire concernées n'ont pas encore obtenu leur droit de propriété). Enfin la présence d'unités de transformation (aliments de bétail, conserves de fruits et légumes, vin) et de commercialisation de produits agricoles (le plus grand souk de la région) renforce le caractère agricole de cette commune. La collecte des données a été réalisée par des entretiens avec des agents du Centre des Travaux et de la commune urbaine ainsi qu'avec un questionnaire utilisé auprès de 30 agriculteurs. L'échantillon d'exploitations agricoles enquêté a été constitué selon 4 critères : les productions dominantes, le statut foncier, la localisation dans les différentes zones habitées de la commune et enfin, leur appartenance au type « familial ». De ce fait cette étude n'a pas pris en compte les quelques exploitations de type entrepreneurial de cette commune qui peuvent compter plusieurs centaines d'hectares chacune. 
 Résultats 
 Une diversité d'exploitations agricoles familiales périurbaines Prenant en compte les 4 critères énoncés précédemment ainsi que le niveau d'intensification des systèmes de production, on propose ci-après une typologie des exploitations familiales de Sebaa-Ayoune en 3 types (Tableau 1). Le Type 1 -les exploitations de polyculture élevage peu intensifiées-est caractérisé par la prédominance de la céréaliculture en bour (52% de la surface agricole totale) associé au maraichage peu intensifié utilisant un minimum d'engrais et de produits phytosanitaires et très rarement l'irrigation localisée. L'olivier et l'amandier cultivés en pluvial subsistent sur de petites surfaces. L'élevage de bovins laitiers reste présent principalement pour la consommation familiale. Les revenus agricoles de ces exploitations proviennent des ventes céréalières (paille et grains) et du maraichage (oignon, pomme de terre). 
 Figure1 : La situation de la ville de Sebaa-Ayoune à proximité de Meknès et Ouislane 
 Sebaa-Ayoune Le Type II -les exploitations de maraichage et/ou d'élevage intensifiéesregroupe les exploitations pratiquants principalement le maraichage intensif (oignon, pomme de terre), celles basées sur un élevage intensif uniquement et celles combinant les deux activités. Le maraichage intensif se caractérise par l'usage plus fréquent de l'irrigation goutte à goutte, l'utilisation régulière des produits phytosanitaires ainsi que par des techniques leur permettant de produire et/ou de commercialiser à contre-saison. L'élevage intensif correspond à la stabulation permanente pour les bovins (en moyenne 9 têtes par exploitation), le recours aux races améliorées pour la production laitière, l'engraissement des veaux en utilisant des aliments industriels. Les grandes cultures pluviales fourragères et céréalières fournissent la base de l'alimentation des bovins, ce qui explique la part encore importante des grandes cultures dans l'assolement (Tableau 1). Le Type III -les exploitations à base d'arboriculture-regroupe celles anciennement cultivées en arboriculture ainsi que celles ayant introduit récemment ce type de cultures pérennes (prunier, pêcher et nectarinier). Ces cultures, de plus en plus pratiquées dans la zone, sont appréciées par les agriculteurs du fait de leur rentabilité économique et de réduction du temps de travail. Parmi ces exploitants, nous distinguons les néoagriculteurs qui sont à 100% en arboriculture sur des surfaces comprises entre 3 et 7 ha. On entend par néo-agriculteurs des personnes habitants en ville (Meknès, Rabat, …) exerçant un autre métier que celui d'agriculteur (professions libérales généralement, haut fonctionnaire parfois,…) ou étant à la retraite, et qui ont investi depuis peu de temps dans l'achat de quelques hectares. On a considéré que les exploitations des néo-agriculteurs étaient de type familial dans la mesure où le capital de départ venait d'un ménage (et non d'une société). Les autres exploitations du Type III sont issues des coopératives de la réforme agraire et combinent aujourd'hui l'arboriculture avec le maraîchage intensif. La céréaliculture est toujours présente mais de façon limitée. L'activité de l'élevage est marginale dans ce type d'exploitation alors que l'irrigation en goutte-goutte devient la pratique courante. Enfin, pour les 3 types d'exploitation, le melk est le statut foncier dominant puisque pour notre échantillon de 30 exploitations, on compte aujourd'hui une seule exploitation (de Type I) ayant le statut foncier de la réforme agraire et deux agriculteurs qui se sont associés à des propriétaires terriens absentéistes pour créer leur exploitation. Les comportements actuels des agriculteurs face au marché foncier sont liés aux types d'exploitation en particulier aux projets qu'ils ont pu réaliser (Tableau 2). On distingue 3 comportements différents de vente partielle de terre : -La vente des terres pour réaliser des investissements en agriculture. 6 agriculteurs ayant vendu une partie de leur terre ont investi ce revenu dans le développement de leur exploitation agricole. Il s'agit principalement des exploitations d'arboriculture (4 cas) des coopératives qui se sont développées grâce à un foncier de départ important pour la région (14 à 15 hectares). Elles ont récemment vendu quelques hectares. Elles ont pu ainsi investir en arboriculture fruitière, activité qui implique un fort investissement au moment de la plantation (plants sélectionnés, équipement en goutte à goutte). Ce marché foncier actif a été aussi bénéfique pour 2 exploitations du Type II qui ont pu avec les revenus issus de la vente de terres s'équiper en matériel agricole et de transport, se convertir à l'irrigation localisée ou accroître leur cheptel. -La vente de terres permet aussi d'investir en dehors de l'agriculture. 6 exploitants ont vendu une partie de leur terre pour créer une activité hors production agricole (commerce, café, transport, location de machines agricoles etc.). Ces situations se rencontrent surtout pour les exploitations de maraichage/élevage (Type II). Lors de nos entretiens, ces agriculteurs sont apparus très attachés à l'activité agricole bien que 45% d'entre eux déclarent que l'activité non agricole procure un revenu supérieur. Ces nouvelles activités ne sont pas seulement des sources de revenu stables mais soutiennent financièrement l'activité agricole en cas de difficultés rencontrées dans ce secteur (aléas climatiques, faible production, chute des prix dans le marché, etc.). 
 -La vente des terres et le mauvais usage des revenus. Dans certains cas, les améliorations du niveau de vie grâce à l'argent ainsi obtenu ont été précaires : celui-ci a pu servir à des dépenses somptuaires, des dons…. Ces agriculteurs sont conscients de leurs responsabilités dans ces échecs et ont éprouvé une grande déception due à la mauvaise gestion de l'argent obtenu ou du projet d'investissement lorsqu'il y en avait un. Cette situation d'échec se trouve chez les polyculteurs (Type I). Qui achète des terres agricoles ? L'achat de la terre est aujourd'hui accessible uniquement à une certaine catégorie aisée de la population. Parmi nos enquêtés, les néo-agriculteurs sont les principaux acquéreurs de terre agricole. La location de terre ou l'association agriculteur-propriétaire terrien permet encore l'accès au foncier agricole. En fait, si les néo-agriculteurs sont presque les seuls à être en mesure d'acheter des terres agricoles, les autres types d'agriculteurs (Types I et II) optent pour l'extension foncière agricole par la location de terres (de 1 500 à 2 500 Dh/ha/an) ou la constitution d'associations avec des propriétaires terriens absentéistes. Il s'agit de producteurs dynamiques qui ne disposent que de quelques hectares en melk (3 à 7 ha) et doivent trouver d'autres terres à cultiver pour développer leurs activités (production de fourrage, rotation pour le maraichage pour gérer la fertilité des terres, …). La location de gré à gré, sans bail, est courante car elle n'engage le propriétaire que sur une campagne agricole. Ainsi il peut facilement vendre sa terre si une opportunité intéressante se présente. Toutefois, deux cas d'association sur une moyenne durée ont été observés (sur environ 40 ha chacun). Le propriétaire est un émigrant qui a hérité récemment de 100 ha de terres cultivables qu'il n'utilise pas 3 . 
 Les agriculteurs périurbains valorisent-ils la proximité de la ville ? Le développement des activités non agricoles. Pour 47% des agriculteurs enquêtés l'agriculture est l'unique source de revenu. Pour les autres (53%) ils exercent des activités non agricoles ou perçoivent une pension de retraite. Les compléments de revenus non agricoles sont assez diversifiés : commerce et prestations liés à l'agriculture dans 31% des cas, commerce et prestations hors agriculture (31%), transport (13%) ainsi qu'à des activités professionnelles et retraites (25%). Le développement de ces activités hors production agricole dans les familles d'agriculteurs est la résultante de l'extension de la population urbaine et des demandes de cette population. De ce fait, on peut considérer que ces agriculteurs ont tiré profit de la proximité de la ville. La commercialisation des produits agricoles : circuits traditionnels ou circuits courts ? La vente des produits agricoles auprès des grossistes est dominante pour les trois types d'exploitation (Tableau 3). Elle s'effectue principalement au champ pour les oignons, les pommes de terre et les autres cultures secondaires (céréales, carottes, navets, …). Dans ce cas, la commercialisation se fait comme dans toutes les autres communes de la province et ne bénéficie pas de la présence du souk hebdomadaire de Sebaa-Ayoune qui est un des plus importants de la région (Meknès inclus). La vente en gros dans ce souk auprès de commerçants-grossistes est surtout le fait des agriculteurs maraîchers de Type II lorsqu'ils disposent d'un moyen de transport. La vente au détail de légumes au souk est une spécificité des exploitations de Type I ce qui s'explique par, d'une part, les faibles quantités de légumes commercialisées et, d'autre part, par le temps dont elles disposent (surface agricole totale plus petite, élevage limité). Les éleveurs laitiers valorisent-ils mieux cette proximité de la ville par la commercialisation du lait en circuit court ? Du fait de l'arrêt de fonctionnement de la coopérative laitière de Sebaa-Ayoune, les éleveurs doivent vendre le lait soit à des colporteurs qui fournissement le marché de Meknès et de Sebaa-Ayoune soit directement à des laiteries 4 de la commune. Mais les prix de vente compris entre 3 et 3,5 Dh/l sont similaires à ceux que les coopératives laitières pratiquent dans la plaine du Saïs. Il s'agit donc à Sebaa-Ayoune de circuits traditionnels de vente du lait qui ont toujours existé depuis la création des villes au Maroc. Il s'agirait de circuit court si l'agriculteur-éleveur se rapprochait du consommateur final en vendant le lait en circulant dans les lotissements, ou installant un point de vente du lait à la ferme. En fait très peu d'agriculteurs enquêtés valorisent la proximité de la ville par la commercialisation en circuit court. Collecteur de lait à Sebaa-Ayoune . Ils ont bénéficié de l'augmentation de la valeur de ce foncier pour faire évoluer leur exploitation. Les « melkistes » quant à eux trouvent plus de difficultés à se développer (à l'exception des néo-agriculteurs). Dans les années 70, ils possédaient une surface cultivable moindre et ont peu profité de la valeur actuelle du foncier. A moyen terme, ces exploitations pourraient disparaitre car lors de la prochaine succession, les héritiers dont une bonne partie ne travaillera pas dans l'agriculture pourront souhaiter vendre les terres si le prix du foncier agricole se maintient au niveau actuel. 
 Discussion et conclusion Les stratégies d'adaptation actuelles des producteurs de cette zone périurbaine n'ont pas été constituées sur des critères de proximité de la ville. Bien que le circuit court «légume » existe via le souk local, les agriculteurs de Sebaa-Ayoune tirent peu profit de cette proximité. Dans ce contexte, la durabilité de l'agriculture familiale passerait-elle nécessairement par l'arboriculture qui marque le paysage et valorise bien le foncier aujourd'hui ? Ou bien une diversité de systèmes de production plus intégrés à la ville par la diversification des activités en fonction des demandes du marché urbain et le développement des circuits courts assurerait elle la durabilité des exploitations périurbaines de la région de Meknès ? Le modèle d'agriculture « arboriculture intensive » (Type III) est celui qui est le plus recherché (ou le plus rêvé) par les agriculteurs familiaux mais il n'est pas sûr que ce soit à moyen terme, le modèle le plus performant économiquement. En 2013 ce modèle de production a été remis en cause par la chute drastique des prix de vente du raisin de  
 Politiques publiques et maintien de l'agriculture périurbaine A l'échelle de la commune de Sebaa-Ayoune, l'agriculture est traitée par les politiques agricoles comme si elle se trouvait en milieu rural strict donc sans prendre en considération l'urbanisation et la croissance démographique des villes. Du côté du ministère de l'agriculture, l'appui aux exploitations s'inscrit dans le Plan Maroc Vert. Aucun projet pilier 1 et pilier 2 n'a vu le jour sur la commune mais le Centre des Travaux poursuit ses activités d'appui à l'agriculture familiale (approvisionnement en semences et en engrais). Le Plan Maroc Vert ne traite pas des spécificités de l'agriculture urbaine et périurbaine et aucun outil n'est mis en place pour la faire évoluer (la maintenir ou accompagner sa disparition). Du coté des politiques d'urbanisme, la priorité est accordée à la construction rapide de logements à moindre coût ou logements sociaux, en tenant peu compte de la préservation d'espaces non bâtis au sein et en périphérie des villes (espaces cultivées ou espaces verts). L'élaboration des plans d'aménagements des communes urbaines se fait sans concertation avec les agriculteurs et les citadins et porte de grands enjeux financiers pour les propriétaires terriens, les intermédiaires, les promoteurs immobiliers . L'élaboration du Plan Communal de Développement est toujours en cours après les diverses phases de diagnostics. Mais là encore il faudra que les agriculteurs de la commune soient consultés et porteurs de projets ou d'idées pour que l'agriculture apparaisse dans la programme des activités prioritaires portées par la commune de Sebaa-Ayoune. Dans ce jeu d'acteurs, la position des agriculteurs est ambiguë car la majorité est melkiste et peut avoir tout intérêt à vendre au plus cher tout ou partie de ses terres pour investir dans l'agriculture à Sebaa-Ayoune ou plus loin des villes. Mais les agriculteurs sans terre ou avec peu de terre sont de plus en plus marginalisés et ne voient pas de pistes de développement. Dans ce contexte, qu'en est-il de la situation des consommateurs, de l'économie régionale et nationale qui voient disparaitre sous le béton des milliers d'hectares de terres fertiles et souvent irrigables chaque année ? Enfin les habitudes alimentaires et d'approvisionnement des consommateurs urbains ne facilitent pas l'émergence de circuits courts pour les produits vivriers, circuits qui permettraient de mieux rémunérer les producteurs et peut être de permettre une meilleure qualité des produits à ces consommateurs. Dans ce domaine mais aussi dans ceux de l'appui à l'agriculture urbaine et périurbaine et de son intégration aux Plans d'aménagement et d'urbanisme et aux Plans Communaux de Développement, tout est à construire.

In 2011, rice crops occupied 164.1 M ha (http://faostat.fao.org [accessed 28/01/2013]). Rice is grown in a variety of environments, covering a wide range of latitudes and altitudes. This crop exhibits a relatively high water demand in comparison with other cereals, and it is characterized by a broad range of adaptation in terms of the hydrological conditions tolerated. The hydrological conditions of rice ecosystems range from fully aerobic (upland rice) to temporarily (rainfed lowland rice or floating rice) or fully anaerobic (irrigated rice)  [1] . Adaptation to a given hydrological regime imposes specific requirements in terms of tolerance to abiotic constraints (submergence or drought). A deep root system, in place before the onset of drought, with thick roots and an extensive branching ability is considered a major component of drought avoidance in rice, enabling the plants to extract water from deep soil layers, provided there is water in the soil profile  [2, 3] . Rice exhibits a large variability in root traits  [4]  that is related to both the organization of the species into varietal groups and the adaptation of these groups to a specific ecosystem  [5] . As a general trend, indica varieties, adapted to the aquatic ecosystems, tend to have a high number of shallow and thin roots with low root/shoot mass ratio while tropical japonica varieties, grown in the upland ecosystem where the risk of drought is high, have a smaller number of roots, which are deeper and thicker, and a higher root/shoot mass ratio. However, the ability of a variety to develop a deep root system is greatly affected by the physical, chemical and biological conditions of the soil, and sub-optimal conditions can substantially reduce differences between varieties through genotype x environment interactions  [6] . Plant phenotyping methods are improving rapidly due to the development of high-throughput platforms and image analysis software packages  [7, 8] . Several platforms specialized on the characterization of the root systems of plants of different ages (from seedling to mature root systems) or in different growth environments (from Petri dish to field) and associated imaging systems have recently been developed  [9] [10] [11] [12] . However, despite this progress, root traits remain among the most difficult traits to measure and to breed for. Indirect selection systems based on molecular markers linked to root traits appeared early on as a potential way to circumvent this problem. Since the first study by Champoux et al.  [13] , numerous genetic studies based on QTL detection in biparental rice populations have been conducted. These studies have led to the identification of many QTLs and a few hotspots (reviewed by Courtois et al.  [14] ). Near isogenic lines have been developed either in the background in which the QTLs were detected or in other backgrounds to validate the phenotypic effects of some of these QTLs  [15, 16] . These results have led to the first release of a variety with an improved root system obtained by marker-aided selection  [17] . The cloning of root QTLs is ongoing. A first gene underlying a QTL for phosphorus uptake, PSTOL1, has been identified and appears to be involved in early root growth  [18] . A QTL for root angle, Dro1, has been cloned  [19] . Other research programs are not far behind. However, many of the QTLs that have been identified in mapping populations were not located with sufficient precision to make identifying the underlying gene viable. Whole-genome association mapping offers better resolution and has recently been shown to be effective in reducing the number of candidate genes underlying individual QTLs, notably in rice  [20] [21] [22] . Linkage disequilibrium decay, which determines the resolution to be expected in the wholegenome association mapping approach, has been reported to range from 500 kb in the temperate japonica rice background to 75 kb in the indica background  [20, 23] . This range (~ 2 to 0.3 cM) represents a significant improvement in comparison with the confidence interval of QTLs detected by linkage mapping in biparental populations. If the lower estimate of 75 kb is used, approximately 5,000 well-distributed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) would be needed to scan the whole rice genome of 390 Mb. One of the limitations of the association mapping approach is the high risk of false-positive associations in structured panels  [24] . The risk of false positives is particularly high in rice because the genetic structure of O. sativa is strongly bipolar, with two major sub-species (indica and japonica) that are thought to have taken different evolutionary paths since their domestication  [25]  or to originate from two different domestication events  [26, 27] . Statistical methods enable efficient correction for various levels of population relatedness  [28] . However, association mapping reaches its limit when the genetic organization of the panel closely follows the distribution of its phenotypic variability  [24] . In such cases, correction for population structure will lead to the elimination of true positives linked to panel structure, creating false negatives. Such a situation is expected for root traits in rice because indica and japonica sub-species have distinct root characteristics  [5, 29] . One way to avoid this problem is to work with less structured panels, such as panels composed of accessions belonging to just one of the two main rice sub-species, provided that the phenotypic diversity within the sub-panel is sufficient for the trait considered. Tropical japonicas are known to be the best source of deep and thick root varieties, and they also exhibit a large degree of withingroup variability. The limited polymorphism expected in a panel with a narrow base is not as problematic with the development of new sequencing technologies. The genomes of several rice varieties have been sequenced, and a very large number of SNPs and indels have been found  [30] . The SNP frequency is evaluated at 1.0 SNP/130 bp among indica accessions and 1.0 SNP/260 bp among tropical japonica accessions  [20, 30, 31] . Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) methods that combine a reduction of genome complexity using restriction enzymes with sequencing using new sequencing technologies have been shown to efficiently provide the marker density needed for association studies  [32, 33] . We present here the results of an association mapping study for root depth and associated traits in a panel of japonica accessions genotyped with SNPs derived from GBS. 
 Materials and Methods 
 Plant material The panel used in this study was composed of 168 traditional and improved japonica accessions  (Table S1 ). The accessions in the panel were mainly tropical accessions, with a few temperate accessions included for reference purposes. Two additional accessions, IR64, an improved indica variety, and Azucena, a traditional japonica variety, which are known to have contrasting root systems  [34] , were used as controls. Seeds of the accessions were obtained either from the Centre de Ressources Biologiques Tropicales de Montpellier or from the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) gene bank (accession numbers in  Table S1 ). For each accession, the seeds were produced by single seed descent over two generations in a Cirad Montpellier greenhouse to ensure that the samples were homogeneous. Seeds of the panel are available for distribution upon request to the first author of this paper as ""Orytage japonica panel"". Genotyping was conducted at Diversity Arrays Technology Pty Ltd. (DArT P/L), Australia, using a method of GBS combining Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) and a next-generation sequencing technique called DArTseq™. The method involves genome complexity reduction using PstI/TaqI restriction enzymes followed by Illumina short-read sequencing. PstIspecific adapters tagged with 96 different barcodes to encode a plate of DNA samples were ligated to the restriction fragments. The resulting products were amplified and checked for quality. The 96 samples were pooled and run in a single lane on an Illumina Hiseq2000 instrument. The PstI adapters included a sequencing primer so that the tags generated were always read from the PstI sites. The resulting sequences were filtered and split into their respective target datasets, and the barcode sequences were trimmed. The sequences were trimmed at 69 bp (5 bp of the restriction site plus 64 bases with a minimum Q score of 10). A proprietary analytical pipeline developed by DArT P/L was used to produce DArT score tables and SNP tables. The remaining 69 bp sequences were aligned to the Os-Nipponbare-Reference-IRGSP-1.0 pseudomolecule assembly  [36]  using Bowtie v0.12  [37]  with a maximum of three mismatches to recover the position of the restriction site for the DArT markers and the position of the polymorphism(s) within the 69 bp sequences for the SNPs. For the DArT markers, the position given is that of the second base of the 6 base PstI restriction site (5'-C|TGCAG-3') because the mutated base is unknown and can be any of the six. The same sequences were then aligned to the pseudomolecules using BLAST (e-value <1.0 e-20) to assess whether additional sequences could be positioned. The sequences that had only one hit on the pseudomolecules or had more than one hit but with a difference of at least 1.0 e-5 between the first and the second hits were retained for further analyses. When the marker position fell within a Michigan State University-annotated gene (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/), the feature was determined (intron, exon, 3' or 5' UTR), and the name and function of the gene were retrieved. Call rates were measured for all markers, and markers with call rates below 80% were discarded. The allele frequency of the remaining markers was then calculated, and markers for which the minor allele had a frequency below 2.5% were also discarded. 
 Imputation of missing data The power to detect significant association is linked to population size. To prevent the loss of detection power, missing data were estimated using Beagle v3.3, which enables the inference of haplotypes and imputation of sporadic missing data in large-scale phase-known or phase-unknown genotype datasets  [38] . Beagle uses a localized haplotype cluster model. It is a special class of directed acyclic graph which empirically models haplotype frequencies on a local scale and therefore adapts to local structure in the data. The model determines a hidden Markov model that can be used to find the most likely haplotype pair for each individual, given the genotype data for that individual and the graphical haplotype frequency model. The method works iteratively using an expectationmaximization type approach. The imputed missing data, probabilities of missing genotypes and inferred haplotypes are calculated from the model that is fitted at the final iteration. The SNP x accession matrix after imputation is available for download at http://tropgenedb.cirad.fr/tropgene/JSP/ interface.jsp?module=RICE as ""Orytage dataset"". 
 Linkage disequilibrium To evaluate the resolution to be expected in association mapping, the linkage disequilibrium within the panel was evaluated by computing the r 2 values between pairs of SNP markers in a sliding window of 50 markers using Tassel  [39]  and tabulating the average r 2 as a function of the physical distances between markers. A power-law (y=ax k ) was fitted to the data to determine the physical position (x) corresponding to a given r 2 value (y). To prevent bias associated with the poor performances of LD indices for markers with very low allelic frequencies  [40] , only markers with a minor allele frequency greater than 10% were used in these computations. 
 Phenotyping The plants were grown in a hydroponic system set in a growth chamber developed by Cirad and called Rhizoscope that has the capacity to handle 192 plants at a time  [41] . The experimental unit was a sandwich of two 50 cm × 20 cm × 2 cm Plexiglas plates (internal dimensions) filled with glass beads of 1.5 mm diameter, called a rhizobox  (Figure 1) . A trap at the bottom of the sandwich enabled the easy removal of the beads at the end of the experiment. This device greatly simplifies the cleaning step while imposing some degree of mechanical resistance to root penetration that is closer to normal soil conditions than is a pure hydroponics system. The rhizobox can be completely opened as well. Similar to nailboard systems, each rhizobox contains a grid of nails, which holds the root system in place after bead removal when the sandwich is opened. The 192 rhizoboxes were set in four large tanks with a capacity of 48 rhizoboxes each (  Figure 2 ). An aerated nutrient solution (volume of 3,000 l) was circulated continuously through the rhizoboxes (composition in  Table S2 ). After pregerminating several seeds per accession at 28°C for three days, one well developed seedling per rhizobox was set on the top of the beads. The solution pH was adjusted to and maintained at 5.4±0.2 by automatic pH controllers. A cooling system maintained the temperature of the solution at 27±1°C. The conditions in the growth chamber were 28°C during the day and 25°C at night with a 12:12 photoperiod. The radiation was 400 to 450 µmol photons per m 2 per s (PAR). The relative humidity was set to 55%. After 30 days of growth (corresponding to a thermal time of 790°C days ), the rhizoboxes were taken out of the tanks, and the beads were removed. The whole root system, which remained in position on the nail plate, was photographed. The angles of the most external left and right crown roots to the vertical were measured with Image J  [42]  before the roots reached the rhizobox sides and could change direction. The sum of these two angles was used as the angle of the root cone (ANGLE) in subsequent analyses. The number of tillers per plant (NBT) was counted, and the length of the longest leaf (LLGTH) was measured as a proxy for plant height. The deepest point reached by the roots was measured in position (DEPTH) and again after the plants were removed from the rhizobox (LENGTH). The number of crown roots reaching 30 cm depth (NBR_30) was counted. Then, the root system was cut into three segments (0-20 cm, 20-30 cm and below 30 cm). Each root segment was carefully washed to remove the remaining beads, if any, dried in an oven at 72°C for three days and weighed (RB0020, RB2030 and RBB30). The total root biomass (RB) and the deep root biomass (DRB) were computed as the sum of the root mass in all three segments and in the two deepest segments, respectively. Deep root proportion (DRP) was computed as the ratio of DRB*100/RB. In rice, root emission is synchronized with tiller emission according to the phyllochron model  [43] . Allometric ratios such as the root-to-shoot mass ratio (R/S) are used to describe the coordination between the growth and development of the roots and shoots  [4] . Shoot tissues were similarly dried and weighed (SB), and the plant biomass (PB) and R/S were computed. The root and shoot traits measured are summarized in  Table 1 . 
 Experimental design The experimental unit was one rhizobox. The experimental design was an alpha lattice with two replicates of 192 rhizoboxes. The two replicates were grown at a three-month interval due to space constraints. In each replicate, the four tanks were considered the main blocks and virtually divided into three sub-blocks of 16 rhizoboxes each. These replicates, blocks and sub-blocks were used as controlled factors for the design optimization and randomization. The two controls, IR64 and Azucena, were included in each sub-block to ensure an additional control for spatial variability. 
 Statistical analysis of phenotypic data An analysis of variance was conducted considering all genotype and block effects as fixed. These effects were tested using SAS v9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary NC, USA), and the means were adjusted for block and sub-block factors. The adjusted means of all accessions are available for download at http:// tropgenedb.cirad.fr/tropgene/JSP/interface.jsp?module=RICE as ""Orytage dataset"". Broad-sense heritabilities based on genotypic means (h 2 ) were computed from the genotype F value of the variance analysis as (F-1)/F  [44] . An ANOVA was conducted on the adjusted means to assess the phenotypic differences among sub-populations. Phenotypic correlations were computed from the adjusted means using SAS. Principal component analyses (PCA) were run using some or all of the measured traits with XLStat  [45] . The coordinates of the accessions on the main axis together with the adjusted means were used in association mapping. 
 Analysis of population structure The structure of the panel was analyzed using a modelbased approach complemented by a discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC  [46] ), using a subset of 200 SNP markers that were well distributed in the genome and had no missing data before imputation. The DAPC was used to help determine the most likely number of sub-populations in the panel, which can be difficult with the model-based approach.  For the model-based approach, the analyses were conducted with the software Structure  [47]  with the following parameters: K, the number of sub-populations in the panel varying from 1 to 15; 10 runs per K value; for each run, 200,000 burn-ins and 200,000 iterations; haploid data with the possibility of admixture; and correlated allelic frequencies. The analyses were run on Bioportal (http://www.bioportal.uio.no/). The R Adegenet package  [48]  was used for DAPC. To illustrate the panel organization, an unweighted neighbor-joining (NJ) tree was constructed based on a dissimilarity matrix computed using a shared allele index with DARwin software  [49] ; subpopulation attributions derived from the model-based approach were projected on the tree. An accession was discretely assigned to a subpopulation when more than 80% of its genome composition came from that subpopulation. The percentages of admixtures from Structure results (Q matrix) were used as covariates in the models to correct the association tests for false positives. 
 Kinship coefficient The control of spurious associations is improved when finer levels of relatedness are taken into account by fitting a markerbased kinship matrix in the models  [28] . Such control is particularly important for panels involving breeding lines. A simple genetic similarity matrix was shown to work as well as a matrix based on identity by descent for this purpose  [50, 51] . The coefficients of kinship between pairs of accessions were determined using a set of 2600 SNPs without any missing data. A pairwise dissimilarity matrix was computed based on simple matching index using DARwin  [49]  and then converted to a similarity matrix (K matrix). 
 Association mapping Using the adjusted means for observations on each accession, we compared three models for their capacity to fit the data: a General Linear Model (GLM) using the percentages of admixture (Q matrix) as fixed effects, a Mixed Linear Model (MLM) using the kinship matrix (K) as a random effect (MLM1) and an MLM using both Q and K (MLM2). The best model was chosen on a trait-by-trait basis by comparing the likelihoods of each model using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC  [52] ). The BIC was computed as -2 ln(L) + kln(n) where ln is the natural logarithm, L is the maximized value of the likelihood function for the estimate model, k is the number of estimated parameters and n is the sample size. The model with the smallest BIC was selected. Analyses for model comparisons were conducted using either R  [53]  for GLM, or Tassel for MLM1 and MLM2. Once the model was chosen, the analyses were conducted using the Linux version of FaST-LMM (Factored Spectrally Transformed Linear Mixed Models) that uses an exact method  [54] . In an exact method, the additive genetic and residual variance components (i.e., the random effects of the mixed model) are re-estimated for each SNP in a model including the marker effect rather than estimated under the null hypothesis. This approach increases the detection power. For each SNP, FaST-LMM computed a p-value, a qvalue corresponding to the False Discovery Rate (FDR  [55] ), the log likelihoods of the null and alternative models and the fixed-effect weight of the SNP with its standard error. The threshold to declare a significant association was set at a probability level of 1.0 e-04. 
 QTL map A database of QTLs for root traits had been established previously  [14] . The physical position and confidence intervals of 137 QTLs for LENGTH, DRB, RB and R_S extracted from this database were used to build a QTL map using the Spidermap Excel macro ( http://jframi.free.fr/wordpress/). The type of mapping population (japonica x japonica, indica x indica, or other type) in which the QTLs were detected was also recovered from the database. The positions of markers that were significantly associated with root phenotypes in this study, as well as the positions of genes known to be involved in root development or nutrient uptake in rice in the literature (""EURoot genes"" set extracted from TropgeneDB: http:// tropgenedb.cirad.fr/tropgene/JSP/interface.jsp?module=RICE ), were added to the map to assess co-localization. 
 Results 
 Marker distribution The GBS method used yielded 16,664 markers (9,727 DArTs and 6,717 SNPs). Approximately 46% of the markers were in genic regions (5' UTR, exon, intron or 3'UTR), which confirmed that PstI, a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme, cut preferentially in gene-rich regions. The average heterozygosity, calculated from the SNP markers, was low (1.3%), as expected for DNA extracted from single plants that had been selffertilized for two generations. The rate of missing data before imputation was 3.8%. Even though the markers with a minor allele frequency below 2.5% had been discarded, the minor allele frequency distribution was still skewed toward low frequencies with an average at 15.5% and 46.2% of the markers with a minor allele frequency below 10%. The number of markers corresponded to an average density of one marker per 22.5 kb. The markers were relatively evenly distributed, with 69% of the intervals between markers of less than 20 kb and 96% of less than 100 kb. Only 19 segments of more than 500 kb without markers were found, including two intervals of approximately 1.0 Mb on chromosomes 4 and 5. In addition, long segments with low polymorphism (low marker density with a high proportion of markers with low minor allele frequency) were detected on chromosomes 4 (approximate position 22.0 to 28.0 Mb), 5 (7.5 to 12.5 Mb),  9 (15.    Figure S1 ). The decay of LD along physical distance is shown in  Table  S3 . For between-marker distances of 0 to 20 kb, the r 2 value attained 0.66. The r 2 value decreased to half this initial level at approximately 150 kb between markers and was 0.2 and 0.1 at 475 kb and 2.4 Mb between markers, respectively. A similar trend was observed for all chromosomes, with similar starting values for the 0-20 kb interval, although the LD decay was more rapid on some chromosomes (e.g., chromosome 5) than on others (e.g., chromosomes 3, 4 and 12). These values are consistent with those expected in such a genetic background. They showed that, on average, the LD in the panel was high and did not decrease rapidly with physical distance. The average marker density (one marker per 22.5 kb) was therefore sufficient for whole-genome association mapping. However, the expected resolution, although better than that achievable with a biparental mapping population of the same size, was still far from the gene level which would require a density higher than one marker per 5 kb. 
 Panel structure and kinship Among the 170 accessions phenotyped, two were classified as indica based on their marker patterns. These two accessions and the indica control IR64 were excluded from the association analyses that were conducted on the 167 japonica accessions. The Structure software results suggested that the japonica panel was composed of six subpopulations and a large number of admixed accessions. The subpopulation assignments of the accessions are given in  Table S1 . The DAPC-based method yielded the same number of subpopulations and the same subpopulation attributions but distributed the admixed accessions into the various subpopulations (data not shown). The structure was partly correlated with geography and partly determined by the breeding program origin. Subpopulation 1, the largest subpopulation (46 acc.), was composed of traditional and improved upland rice varieties from Africa and Latin America, reflecting the intensity of exchanges between the breeding programs in these areas. Subpopulation 2 (30 acc.) was composed mainly of traditional upland varieties of equatorial Asia (Indonesia, the Philippines or Malaysia). Subpopulation 3 (20 acc.) was composed of traditional upland rice varieties from Southeast Asia. Subpopulation 4 (10 acc.) contained several varieties from temperate origins or that had adapted to cold climates. Subpopulation 5 (8 acc.) consisted of Indonesian varieties, some of which belonged to the bulu ecotype, which is adapted to the lowland ecosystem. Subpopulation 6 (6 acc.) was composed of improved accessions derived from the variety Colombia 1. Forty-eight varieties appeared to be admixed. This relatively high admixture percentage (1/3) confirms that gene exchange has occurred among these subpopulations. The projection of the subpopulations on an NJ tree is shown in  Figure S2 . The kinship matrix recorded values ranging from 0.61 to 0.98, showing a broad range of familial relatedness between pair of accessions. 
 Phenotyping root architecture The analysis of variance  (Table 2 ) enabled us to assess the extent of the experimental noise in our phenotyping system. In most cases, the replicate and block effects were highly significant, whereas the sub-block effect was not. These results indicated some degree of heterogeneity in temperature and humidity in the growth chamber. The genotype effect, involving all accessions except the controls, was highly significant for all root and shoot traits. Moderate to large variation was observed for most root parameters, with CVs varying from 13% for DEPTH to 103% for RBB30  (Table 3 ). The distribution of the root parameters were globally normal, with the exceptions of NBR_30, RB2030 and RBB30, which had skewed distributions due to the presence of accessions with shallow roots that did not exceed 30 cm in length  (Figure 3 ). The broad-sense heritabilities based on genotypic means, which measure the reproducibility of the experiment, were also reasonably high, varying from 0.66 for NBR_30 to 0.89 for DRP. The six subpopulations of the panel differed in terms of means for all traits except for RB0020  (Table 4 ). Subpopulations 1 (upland rice varieties from Africa and Latin America), 2 (traditional upland varieties of equatorial Asia) and 3 (upland rice varieties from Southeast Asia) were showing the deepest roots (high NBR_30, DRB, DRP, DEPTH and LENGTH) with subpopulation 3 characterized by a larger biomass (NBT, SB, RB and PB) than subpopulations 1 and 2. Subpopulations 4 (temperate accessions) and 5 (bulu types) were showing a large shoot biomass, similar root mass in the shallow horizon than the other subpopulations but much more limited root mass in depth and low R_S. Sub-population 6 (accessions derived from Colombia 1) was composed of small size accessions with limited shoot biomass (low LLGTH, NBT, SB and PB), limited root development and intermediate R_S. 
 The admixed group was intermediate for most traits. A large degree of positive phenotypic correlations was observed between the traits measured  (Table S4 ). Some of these correlations were expected from the physiological relatedness of the traits. For instance, this was the case for all traits linked with root depth (LENGTH, DEPTH, NBR_30, RN2030 and RBB30) which had correlation coefficients above 0.75 among each other (P<0.0001). However, the root cone angle, which is often considered as a proxy for root depth, showed a weak correlation with root depth in our system and in a direction opposite to what was expected (r 2 = 0.29 with DEPTH and 0.33 with LENGTH). In the multivariate analysis (PCA) conducted on all the measured traits, the first two principal components summarized 74.5% of the variability. The  correlation circle  (Figure 4)  showed that the first axis was mainly a vigor axis, separating plants with small and large biomasses, whereas the second axis divided shoot or shallow root traits (NBT, LLGTH, SB, RB0020) and deep root traits (LENGTH, DEPTH, NBR_30, DRB or R/S). The accessions on the first plane tended to be grouped by subpopulation (data not shown). A second PCA was conducted using only deep root traits (LENGTH, DEPTH, NBR_30, RBB30, DRB and DRP). The first axis summarized 87.9% of the variation, and the second explained only 5.0% (data not shown). The scores of the accessions on the first axis of the second PCA (PCA1) that separated shallow rooted and deep-rooted accessions were included among the phenotypic traits used in association mapping. 
 Association mapping Most phenotypic traits were affected by panel structure in similar ways. The comparison of the BICs of the three models (GLM, MLM1 and MLM2) showed that MLM2, which included both the population structure and kinship matrix, was the best model for almost all traits  (Table 5) . MLM1, which included only the kinship matrix, was the best model for NBT, PB and SB. GLM, which included only population structure, was always inferior to the two other models. The smaller number of false positives in MLM compared to GLM is illustrated by the cumulative distribution of p-values compared to the uniform distribution, as shown on the quantile-quantile plots for DRB, LENGTH and NBR_30 (  Figure 5 ). The synthetic results of the association mapping run with the best model for each trait are presented in  Table 6 . The Manhattan plots for four selected root traits (RBB30, DRB, NBR_30 and LENGTH) are presented in  Figure 6 . Nineteen markers were significantly associated with a trait at P<1e-05, which corresponded to a q-value below 0.05; 78 markers were significantly associated with a trait at P<1e-04, which corresponded to a q-value below 0.05 in 30 cases (38%) and to a q-value between 0.05 and 0.10 in 28 cases (36%), with the remaining 20 markers having q-values above 0.10. In a few cases, several markers belonging to the same chromosome segment in full LD were found to have the exact same level of significance (e.g., SNPs in the interval from 34,890,451-34,939,105 bp on chromosome 1 for a range of traits). These segments were less than 50 kb in length, except for one interval on chromosome 8 (460 kb). The number of significant markers at P<1e-04 varied among traits, from 0 to 17. DRB and RBB30, the two traits showing the largest range of phenotypic variation, and NBT were associated with the highest number of significant markers, whereas no significant associations were detected for RB or DRP. Some markers  were significantly associated with several traits, which meant that only 51 different sites or segments were found to be significant at P<1e-04 for one of the traits. Among those 51 loci, 53% had a minor allele frequency of less than 10%, which corresponded to the representation of markers with low minor allele frequency in the marker set. Two groups of traits had a high level of co-localization of the significant loci. The first group was composed of traits describing root depth (DRP, RBB30 and NBR_30), with 15 loci significant for two traits (on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11 and 12) and five loci significant for all three traits (on chromosomes 1, 2, 7 and 10) among the 24 loci with significance for any of the three traits. RB2030, LENGTH, DEPTH and ACP1 were also related to this first group. The second group of traits was composed of SB, PB and RB0020; among the six loci significant for any of the traits (on chromosomes 4, 5, 7 and 11), four were significant for all three traits. NBT was associated with this group, as was RB, but this association was less clear because the levels of significance were lower for this trait. R_S co-localized erratically. One trait, LLGTH, was almost independent, and another trait, ANGLE, was fully independent of the other traits.  
 Localization of significant loci Among the 51 loci significantly associated with one or more traits, 19 were in predicted genes, and ten of these encoded expressed or hypothetical proteins without known functions. The 32 other loci were in intergenic regions. Among the 37 loci associated with a root trait (excluding loci associated only with LLGTH, NBT, SB or PB), 20 co-localized with root QTLs on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 (  Figure 7) . The 17 remaining loci did not co-localize with any QTLs considered in this study. When focusing on the 12 QTLs detected only in japonica x japonica mapping populations, i.e. in the same genetic background than the association panel, 4 loci on chromosomes 1, 7 and 9 co-localized with those QTLs. There was almost no co-localization with rice genes with demonstrated role in root development. No marker co-localized with sd1, the major semi-dwarfism-inducing gene located on chromosome 1, which is known to influence plant biomass. In fact, the semi-dwarfism allele, which is very common in improved irrigated varieties, is not commonly used in upland rice breeding. Close physical proximity (20 kb) was observed between a marker associated with both DRB and RB2030 and Dro1, a cloned root angle QTL located on chromosome 9, but the significance of the marker was slightly below the threshold of 1e-04  (Table S5) . Given the level of LD in the panel (r20.6 at a distance between markers below 20 kb), we also surveyed the genes that were in an interval of +/-25 kb on both sides of the significant markers. We found 521 genes, of which 261 had a predicted function  (Table S6) . Among these 261 genes, kinases  (27)  were over-represented relative to their overall presence in the rice genome (10.3% versus 3.5%). Several other genes appeared as potentially relevant candidates: multicopper oxidases (three in a cluster on chromosome 1); gibberellin dioxygenases (five on chromosomes 1, 2 and 11); glutathione-S transferases (two on chromosomes 1 and 11); and elongation factors (five). 
 Discussion We performed an association mapping study for root traits in the rice japonica group using a medium-throughput hydroponic root phenotyping system with glass beads and marker data obtained by GBS. Hydroponics enables an easy observation of the root system but does not permit to assess root growth reaction in response to drought. However, in rice, what is crucially important for productivity under drought stress situations is the presence of deep roots prior to the onset of stress  [3, 56] . Under severe drought stress, root plasticity is limited, with no increase in root distribution in depth, to the contrary of what is occurring in maize  [57] . Therefore the constitutive expression of the genetic potential in the absence of stress, which is what is assessed under hydroponic conditions, is seen as an important element by rice breeders  [58] . The selection of varieties introgressed with a QTL for root depth detected under favorable conditions has already led to the release of a variety drought resistant under rainfed conditions  [17]  The hydroponic system with glass beads has the advantage over hydroponics without substrate or homogeneous media such as agar, to involve a granular substrate and to impose a physical constraint to root growth through glass beads. This system is therefore expected to be closer to field conditions, in which the soil strength increases when the soil dries, although a formal comparison remains to be done. The effect of mechanical impedance on roots has been investigated  [59, 60] . Mechanical impedance decreases elongation rate, increases root diameter and modifies branching but, because compensation occurs, does not affect total root biomass. We chose to grow plants to an age of 30 days to maximize the differences among accessions, but this choice, imposing the use of large rhizoboxes, reduced the throughput of the experiment. The number of accessions that can be phenotyped in the system is limited by the trade-off between the need to create conditions under which plants express relevant variation and to accurately control the sources of environmental phenotypic variation, and the requirement of association mapping in terms of panel size. Using simulations, Kang et al.  [51]  demonstrated a dramatic increase in power by using replicate measurements in association mapping. However, even with only two replicates, the trait heritabilities we obtained through our experimental design were generally high. The issue of whether any phenotyping system under controlled conditions can accurately represent what occurs in the field is always a subject of debate. The development of the plant root system in the Rhizoscope is reasonably well correlated with what has been observed in plants grown in soil columns for several traits  [29]  for the 30 accessions shared between the two studies, although the resource conditions and plant age were not identical in the two systems. The transferability from the Rhizoscope to field situations remains to be evaluated. In a field, the plant genetic makeup interacts with multiple physical, chemical and biological soil factors, often heterogeneously distributed, and genotype x environment interactions will likely lead to differences in root system growth and architecture. The simplification permitted by near optimal controlled conditions is useful when the objective is to assess the genetic potential on a comparative basis for a set of accessions. However, as demonstrated by Rich and Watt  [61] , a better understanding of how soil conditions and inter-plant competition for space and resources regulate root architecture is needed to translate this potential into information relevant to different field conditions. Root spread angle has been proposed as a proxy for root depth for some cereal species such as rice  [62] , and sorghum  [63]  because the angle is easier to measure and show a good heritability, although the relationship does not hold true for other species such as durum wheat  [64] . The relationship between narrow root growth angle relative to the vertical and root depth, indirectly observed by Kato et al.  [62]  using the basket phenotyping system, was not observed in our system. This lack of relationship was observed not only in the present japonica panel but also in an indica panel (Audebert et al., unpublished data) and therefore cannot be attributed to the genetic background. This discrepancy may result in part from the fact that the two studies do not measure exactly the same variable. The basket method computes the average frequency of roots above a given angle, assessing the whole root system in three dimensions, whereas our system only counts the most external roots in a system that is two-dimensional. Another possible explanation for the differing results is that the effect of gravimetric forces is partly compensated by Archimedes's push under hydroponic conditions. The phenotyping of the panel showed results that were fully consistent with previous observations in terms of characteristics of the sub-populations  [5] . The sub-population root characteristics matched their different adaptations: subpopulations 1, 2 and 3, with deep roots, are composed of varieties adapted to tropical or equatorial aerobic upland systems while subpopulations 4 and 5, with shallow roots, are composed of accessions adapted to the anaerobic temperate irrigated and tropical rainfed lowland systems respectively. Accessions from subpopulation 6, with their small above ground and below ground biomasses are adapted to high input aerobic situations with high plant density only common in Latin America  [58] . The GBS method yielded a large number of markers. Their distribution was not completely even across the genome but was sufficiently homogeneous to let only few and small loosely covered genomic regions. A few segments with low marker density (e.g., segments on chromosomes 4 and 7) correspond For each QTL, when a test of association with any trait is significant at P<1.0e-05, the pvalue of the tests of association with other traits (up to P<5e-04) is given in italics. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0078037.t006 to zones that have previously been identified as SNP deserts in the species  [65] , but most seem to be specific to the japonica group. Huang et al.  [20] , working with a panel including indica and japonica accessions, found that approximately 10% of the SNPs were nearly fixed (frequency >95% in one sub-species and <5% in the other), and 3.5% were completely fixed. The risk of encountering an important proportion of markers with very low to low minor allele frequency was expected to be high in a panel belonging to one sub-species. We made a deliberate choice to focus on the japonica group because the use of a core collection representative of the overall genetic diversity of O. sativa carried the alternative risk of having true associations appear as false negatives given the correlation between phenotypic variability and population structure for root traits in rice  [5, 29] . If the variation in a trait is caused by alleles with low frequency, there is a high risk of not detecting the associations due to a lack of statistical power  [24] . Conventional mapping, which ensures a balanced allelic frequency, is better adapted to such situations. The use of a larger population size is another way to limit the problems of variance heterogeneity between highly unbalanced genotypic classes. However, depending on the phenotyping system, very large population sizes are often detrimental to phenotypic precision, or are simply unaffordable. The LD decay we observed (150 kb) is in the range of those reported by Mather et al.  [23] , Huang et al.  [22] , and Xu et al.  [30]  in japonica backgrounds, which vary between 150 and 180 kb, although our panel involves a relatively large proportion of breeding lines. This relatively slow LD decay limits the resolution of association mapping, but the 16,444 markers genotyped provide sufficiently high genome coverage to ensure that most genes are in LD with one or more markers. We detected several markers that are significantly associated with root traits, showing that genome-wide association mapping can be used to dissect those traits in a tropical japonica panel. As shown in  Table 6 , a few markers were found to be associated with several traits that are linked by construction or because of pleiotropy, i.e., traits determining biomass on the one hand, and traits determining root depth on the other hand. These two groups of traits were also the ones showing the highest within group phenotypic correlations. The comparison of the positions of the markers detected with previously published data showed that some of the identified markers co-localized with QTLs, but almost none co-localized with any of the limited number of genes presently known to influence root growth in rice. A certain proportion of these colocalizations might be due to chance because the sum of the confidence intervals of the 137 QTLs covered 52 % of the genome. However, 46 % of the markers that were significantly associated with root traits did not colocalize with any known QTL. This finding was expected because the large majority of the root QTL studies focused on indica x japonica mapping populations  [14] . Only 4 studies (coresponding to 7% of the detected root QTLs) used japonica x japonica mapping populations and none a tropical japonica x tropical japonica mapping population. By focusing on the within-japonica diversity, which has only rarely been investigated, one of our objectives was to identify new loci involved in root development. This seems to be the case. Conversely, some highly supported meta-QTLs, such as mMRL_9-2  [14] , did not co-localize with any significant markers detected here. The allele at this meta-QTL may be fixed in the japonica subspecies, as could be suspected from the low polymorphism observed around its position in the japonica panel. Because the LD in this panel spans long distances and because the marker density is 22.5 kb on average, the Data were extracted from the rice module from TropgeneDB for the root genes (""EURoot genes"" set) and the QTLs (http:// tropgenedb.cirad.fr/tropgene/JSP/interface.jsp?module=RICE). The QTL numbers correspond to their ID in this database. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0078037.g007 resolution of association mapping is much broader than the single-gene level. An analysis of the genes near the significant markers suggested several possible candidate genes based on data from Arabidopsis or other evidence. For instance, the multicopper oxidase domain-containing genes are known to play a role in root development in low phosphate situations  [66] , glutathione-S-transferases have been reported to be involved in meristem maintenance and the growth of lateral roots  [67] , and several LRR-LRKs have been found to be associated with a root mutant phenotype in rice (Dievart, personal communication). However, further evidence is needed to demonstrate that these genes are indeed involved in root growth in rice. Although several significant markers were detected, we found fewer markers than we anticipated given that linkage mapping studies conducted in smaller biparental populations detected many more QTLs per trait  [14] . The limited number of highly significant associations may be partly attributed to the fixation of some QTLs in the japonica panel, as noted above, but the number of markers may also be partly responsible. Although theoretically more than sufficient, considering the panel average LD, the marker density may be too low in zones where LD decays more rapidly or breaks down due to recombination events. Most functional polymorphisms are probably absent from our marker set. As demonstrated by Segura et al.  [68] , when LD is not at its maximum, the power of the association study decreases sharply when the functional variants are untyped. A high-quality 950,000 SNP array is under development for rice  [31] , and our panel will be genotyped with this chip, enabling more powerful analyses in the future. In addition, new methods might be used to increase the detection power. As suggested by Koerte et al.  [69] , correlated traits essentially represent a form of replication. The joint analysis of correlated traits might provide additional power in detecting associations, as shown by the same team through simulations. In the same way, multi-locus mixed models, similar to the composite interval mapping used in classical linkage mapping, may be helpful in situations involving loci with moderate to large effects  [6] . This association mapping study was conducted in a japonica panel. We intend to conduct a similar study in an indica panel of similar size to determine whether the associations detected are specific to the japonica sub-species or are common to both sub-species. A pooled analysis of the two panels might provide additional detection power as a result of the larger population size, at least for markers that are not correlated with population structure.

As a result of this characteristic, they are responsible for donating regulatory sequences  [1]  and transcription regulatory signals  [2] , as well as for creating considerable genomic instability, mediating chromosome rearrangements  [3] , altering both gene expression and function  [1] , and creating novel genes and exons  [4] . Such mobilization can also result in host genome contraction and expansion  [5] ,  [6] . According to a unified classification system proposed for eukaryotic transposable elements  [7] , TEs can be grouped into two classes according to their transposition mode: Class I elements (retrotransposons), which use the enzyme Reverse Transcriptase (RTase) to transpose via an RNA intermediate to a new genome insertion site, and Class II elements, which are transposed directly via DNA molecule using a transposase (Tpase) enzyme. Class I elements are divided into five orders (LTR, DIRS, PLE, LINEs, SINEs), each of which is subdivided into superfamilies (LTR: Copia, Gypsy, Bel-Pao, Retrovirus, ERV; DIRS: DIRS, Ngaro, VIPER; PLE: Penelope; LINEs: R2, RTE, Jockey, L1, I; SINEs: tRNA, 7SL, 5S). Class II (DNA transposons) elements are split into two subclasses: subclass I contains superfamilies either with terminal inverted repeats (Tc1-Mariner, hAT, Mutator, Merlin, Transib, P, PiggyBac, PIF-Harbinger and Cacta) or without terminal inverted repeats (Crypton), whereas subclass II comprises the Helitron and Maverick superfamilies. Plant genomes are massively invaded by repetitive DNA, primarily LTR retrotransposons  [8] . Many of these retrotransposons are located near host genes and thus could impact the expression of these neighboring genes whose expression is mediated by a variety of mechanisms, such as RNAi  [9] , DNA methylation  [10] , and readout transcription  [11] . While the transcriptional activity of TEs seems to be tightly controlled by host genomes  [12] , e.g. by transcriptional gene silencing mechanisms such as those that prevent the access of the host transcriptional machinery  [13] , reports also show that TEs can be activated under certain stress conditions, such as pathogen infection, physical injuries, abiotic stress  [14]  or cell culture  [15] ,  [16] ,  [17] ,  [18] . Of the approximately one hundred species in the Coffea genus, only C. arabica and C. canephora are used in commercial production, representing ,70% and 30% of global coffee production, respectively  [19] . C. arabica is a unique polyploidy species of the genus (4n = 4X = 44 chromosomes) and was derived from a recent (1 million years ago) natural hybridization between C. canephora and C. eugenioides  [20] . C. canephora is a diploid (2n = 2x = 22 chromosomes) and is an auto-incompatible species that grows in humid and lowland habitats. It is usually more resistant to pests and diseases as well as to abiotic stresses like water deprivation and is also characterized by a higher productivity and bean caffeine content than C. arabica. However, the quality of the beverage is regarded as inferior to that of C. arabica  [21] . The identification of transposable elements in Coffea was initiated only recently  [22] ,  [23] ,  [24] ,  [25] ,  [26] . To our knowledge, detailed analyses of the abundance, activity and regulation of transcriptionally active TEs in Coffea genomes, as well as analyses of the relationship of these to their chromosomal distribution, have yet to be performed. We previously searched the Brazilian Coffee Genome Project database (LGE database, http:// www.lge.ibi.unicamp.br/cafe) aiming to identify TE fragments within coding regions in expressed sequences (ESTs) of three Coffea species (C. arabica, C. canephora and C. racemosa). The ESTs and unigenes harboring TEs were analyzed regarding the size of the TE fragment, the functional categories to which they were assigned to and to their contribution to the proteome  [22] . In the present study, we rescreened the LGE database using a more sensitive method, which allowed for a substantial increase in the number of unigenes harboring TEs, and used the gene sequences to identify paralogous unigenes that do not contain TEs. Expression levels of isoforms with and without TEs in C. arabica and C. canephora transcriptome were analyzed in cell culture and plants grown under different irrigation conditions. This approach was taken in order to understand the regulatory effects that exonized TEs may exert on Coffea host genes. The expression levels of TE transcripts themselves were also assayed across the same conditions in order to better understand how they are regulated and how they respond to various stresses including different drought and irrigation conditions as well as cell culture and polyploidization. The chromosomal distribution of Coffea TEs was interrogated genome-wide for the first time here using FISH. 
 Results 
 Frequency and Classification of Expressed TEs in the Transcriptomes of Coffea spp A set of 181,405 ESTs derived from 39 cDNA libraries (31 from C. arabica and 8 from C. canephora) were used to identify, classify and quantify the number of expressed TEs. Sequence similarity searches allowed the identification of 320 EST sequences homologous to TEs in the two Coffea species  (Table 1; Tables S1  & S2 in File S1 ). For C. arabica, the proportion of sequences that were homologous to DNA transposons (51%) and to LTR+NLTR retrotransposons (49%) were similar (P.0.05). Ty3/Gypsy was the most frequently identified superfamily among the LTR Retrotransposons (22%). However, in C. canephora, the proportion of transposons (13.2%) and retrotransposons (86.8%) was considerably different, as were the frequencies of Ty3/Gypsy (80.5%) and Ty1/Copia (3.6%) (both P,0.05). The TEs were classified into families based on the best alignment against a completely characterized reference TE library (  Table S3  in File S2). The 100 ESTs from C. arabica were classified into 24 families, 8 belonging to DNA transposons and 16 to Retrotransposons (LTR:13, NLTR: 1 and not classified: 2) and the 220 ESTs from C. canephora were classified into 18 families (DNA transposons: 7, LTR Retrotransposons: 9, NLTR: 1 and not classified LTR: 1). The main difference between diversity of TE families between the two species is due to higher number of Ty1-Copia families in C. arabica, which harbors seven families of this superfamily of LTR retrotransposon, but excepting Tst1, all occurring in just one EST (  Figure 1 , Tables S1 & S2 in File S1). Both species differ also regarding the TEs expression. For example, the most expressed families in C. arabica among the retrotransposons, considering their expression among the total TEs and among the TE classes, respectively, were Retrosat2 (11 ESTs: 11% of the TEs and 22% of Class I), Melmoth (8 ESTs: 8% of the TEs and 16% of Class I) and Tst1 (6 ESTs: 6% of the TEs and 12% of Class I). Regarding the DNA transposons, the most expressed families in C. arabica were MuDR (12 ESTs: 12% of the TEs and 24% of Class II), Jittery (11 ESTs: 11% of the TEs and 22% of Class II) and Soymar (11 ESTs: 11% of the TEs and 22% of Class II). Likewise, in C. canephora the most expressed retrotransposons were dea1 (94 ESTs: 43% and 49%), Retrosat2 (56 ESTs: 25% and 29%) and Del1 (18 ESTs: 8% and 9%) and, the most expressed DNA transposons were MuDR (7 ESTs: 3% and 24%), AtMu and Activator (6 ESTs each: 2.7% and 21%), and Jittery (5 ESTs: 2% and 17%). 
 Characterization of cDNA Clones from C. arabica Similar to TEs After the 100 clones identified in C. arabica were classified into families, the redundant clones (identical ESTs and identified in the same library) were excluded and 64 clones remained, from which a sample of 27 were fully sequenced  (Table S4  in File S3) and the remaining partially sequenced. Again, this set of sequences was compared against two TE banks: the reference elements cited above and the collection of consensus TEs stored in Repbase  [27] . The results showed that these cDNAs were highly similar to elements from Repbase described in species closely related to the genus Coffea, such as Vitis vinifera and Solanum tuberosum. The occurrence of frame shifts and stop codons was distinct for some comparisons due to the differential choice of frame in the sequence translation. Putative complete transposase or polyprotein searches were performed by evaluating CDSs that spanned at least 60% of the reference or consensus TE and had no frame shifts and stop codons. 
 Expression Levels of TE Transcripts Macroarray expression profiling was performed for 64 TE transcripts (31 DNA transposons and 33 retrotransposons) in six samples from the allotetraploid C. arabica (callus treated with cycloheximide versus untreated callus (CHX+, CHX-), irrigated versus non-irrigated leaves (_I, _NI) from drought tolerant versus drought sensitive cultivars (I59, Rubi)), and in two samples from the diploid C. canephora (14_). Many TEs exhibit relatively low expression levels  (Figure 2A  and  Figure S1  in File S4), and overall TEs are expressed at significantly lower levels than genes measured for the same cultivars and conditions (  Figure 2B ). TE expression patterns across the species, cultivars and conditions assayed here are highly dynamic and apparently unrelated to their classification at the level of TE class (DNA transposon versus retrotransposons) or at level of specific TE families (  Figure 2C ). When hierarchical clustering is used to relate the expression patterns of individual TE transcripts, there is no apparent coherence within TE classes or families; individual members of TE classes and families are dispersed throughout the resulting tree (  Figure S2  in File S4). The coherence of expression patterns within and between TE families was also measured using average Manhattan distances between TE expression profiles. There is no statistical difference in the average distances between TE expression profiles within or between families (  Figure 2D ). This same lack of overall coherence in TE expression patterns can be seen at the level of individual TE families, where there is generally no difference in the distances between expression profiles within or between families (  Figure S3  in File S4). Exceptions to this overall pattern can be seen for the Jittery and Tip100 families of DNA transposons, which have relatively coherent within family expression patterns  (Figure 2A  and  Figure S3  in File S4). Interestingly, TE expression for CHX-(callus untreated) is not higher than that of the other tissues/conditions in C. arabica (  Figure  S4  in File S4), suggesting that cell culture conditions do not derepress TE expression in this species. The dynamic expression patterns seen for individual TE transcripts, along with the overall lack of TE expression pattern coherence within classes and families of elements, suggest that the expression of individual TE insertions is independently regulated based in part on the surrounding genomic environment. This may include both sequence-based and epigenetic factors for the surrounding genomic environment. However, it should be noted that changes in TE expression in response to cycloheximide treatment appear to be more consistent across individual TE insertions. On average, TEs are expressed at higher levels in callus treated with cycloheximide (CHX+ versus CHX-in  Figure 3) ; although, the difference is only marginally significant owing to the high level of variation in TE expression under cycloheximide   Tables S1 and S2  in File S1). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0078931.g001 treatment. Nevertheless, there are a number of individual TE transcripts that show highly significant differences between CHX+ and CHX-conditions (  Figure 2E  and  Figure S5  in File S4). Cycloheximide (CHX) is a compound that blocks translation and thereby inactivates the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway (NMD). The NMD pathway provides for the detection and degradation of aberrant mRNAs that contain premature termination codons resulting from point mutations, rearrangements or errors during transcription or RNA processing  [28] . More to the point, NMD may also represent a genome defense mechanism against the proliferation of TEs since mRNA sequences derived from TEs are frequent targets of NMD  [29] . Thus, the upregulation of TE expression upon CHX treatment would seem to reflect the mitigation of the plant genome's NMD based defense against TE expression. The consistency of this pattern seen across TE transcripts assayed here underscores the likely importance of NMD in genome defense against plant TE expression. We performed similar comparative analyses in order to evaluate whether there are overall differences in TE expression between paired samples of irrigated (I) and non-irrigated (NI) cultivars that are either drought sensitive or drought tolerant. TE transcripts tend to be expressed at significantly higher levels in non-irrigated cultivars for the drought tolerant samples; this effect is marginally significant for C. arabica leaves and more highly significant for C. canephora leaves  (Figure 3 ). Drought sensitive cultivars from C. arabica show the opposite pattern with irrigated samples showing significantly higher TE expression (  Figure 3 ). Considered together, these results suggest the interesting possibility that TE expression levels may be tuned to the drought response proclivities of their host genomes. 
 TE-Derived CDSs The unigenes containing TE cassettes (i.e. exonized TEs) previously identified in the C. arabica and C. canephora ESTs using RepeatMasker  [22]    
 Effect of Exonized TEs on the Expression and Regulation of TE-containing Transcripts by NMD Screening the unigenes containing TE cassettes from C. arabica (86) and C. canephora (59) against their respective sets of unigenes allowed the identification of 111 and 47 paralogous unigenes, respectively, based on their high sequence similarity  (Tables S5 &  S6  in File S5), as illustrated in  Figure S6  (File S4). Two sets of alignments showed evidence of putative alternative splicing in C. arabica. The first had three transcripts (uni_CA_046, uni_CA_125 and uni_CA_127) that were similar to a rust resistance Rp1-D-like protein (GB: AAK18308) and the second had two transcripts (uni_CA_055 and uni_CA_138) that were similar to a universal stress protein (USP) family protein (GB: NP_850562). Additionally, this analysis is not exhaustive because 1) the EST libraries were built based only on the representation of the 59 end of mRNAs, preventing the identification of TEs in other portions of the transcript; 2) several libraries were not targeted for full sequencing (saturation), particularly for C. canephora, which meant that fewer tissues were represented and fewer ESTs were obtained; and 3) the limited Coffea genomic resources do not enable a complete analysis of gene structure and TE insertion sites or the identification of transcripts related to each expressed locus. The expression levels of 77 gene transcripts containing TE cassettes (TE+Genes) and 63 paralogous gene transcripts that lacked TEs (TE-Genes) were analyzed using macroarrays across the same eight cultivars as previously described for C. arabica and C. canephora (  Figure S1  in File S4). TE+Genes have significantly lower levels of overall expression than TE-Genes (  Figure 4A  &  Figure S7A  in File S4), and in fact TE+Gene expression levels are not distinguishable from those of TE transcripts themselves (  Figure 2B ). This result indicates that the presence of TEs in genic transcripts leads to their down-regulation and suggests the possibility that mechanisms similar to those used to repress TE transcript, such as NMD, may be involved in this process. To test this possibility, we compared the effects of CHX treatment on TE+Genes versus TE-Genes. TE+Genes show significantly greater overall levels of expression in CHX+ conditions compared to CHX-, whereas TE-Genes show no such difference in expression across the different CHX treatments (  Figure 4B  &  Figure S7B  in File S4). CHX+ conditions, which are seen facilitate the expression of TE+Genes, inactivate the NMD pathway for aberrant transcript repression. Thus, these results are consistent with the activation of the NMD pathway by the presence of TE cassettes within expressed gene transcripts. 
 Chromosomal Distribution of TEs in C. arabica and its Parental Species Three TEs (two transposons: MuDR and Tip100 and one LTRretroelement: Del1) with average low expression levels were selected, and their chromosomal distribution was evaluated using FISH in C. arabica var. typica, C. eugenioides and C. canephora (  Figure 5 ). The transposon signals were preferentially clustered in chromosomal terminal positions in the two ancestors (C. eugenioides and C. canephora) of C. arabica. Interstitial and/or proximal signals were observed in larger numbers in C. arabica var. typica, especially using the Tip100 probe, indicating an increase in transposition activity in this species compared to the parental species. The probe containing the LTR-retrotransposon Del1 showed a different hybridization profile, exhibiting signals that were more scattered. The number of positions hybridized with the Del1 probe in C. arabica was nearly the same as that of the sum of signals of C. eugenioides and C. canephora. Furthermore, C. canephora chromosomes showed preferentially clustered signals, and most C. eugenioides chromosomes showed dispersed signals. These results are in agreement with previous FISH results  [30]  using another probe containing a fragment homologous to a gag-like element from a Del1 LTR-retrotransposon isolated from the germplasm of C. arabica var. typica. Similarities in Ty1-copia-like retroelement among the different Coffea genomes were also reported  [25] . 
 Discussion This study provides a preliminary understanding of the TE regulatory dynamics in the allotetraploid and complex genome of C. arabica. The findings presented here show that this species is an interesting study organism because most DNA transposons and retrotransposons seem to be submitted to fine transcriptional control. Differences and similarities with other plant genomes were observed. For instance, it has been reported that cell culture conditions increase the expression levels of some TEs in plants, as for example Tnt1 from tobacco  [31] ; Tos10, Tos17 and Tos19 from rice  [32] ; several DNA transposons and retrotransposons from sugarcane  [17] ; and LTR retrotransposons from rice  [18] . In contrast to these previous observations, our results show that cell culture conditions per se do not elevate TE expression levels in C. arabica. On average, TEs in untreated cell culture conditions (CHX-) show no significant difference in expression levels compared to TEs analyzed from C. arabica plant tissue (  Figure  S4  in File S4). These results suggest that TE regulatory and/or suppression mechanisms remain largely intact in C. arabica cell culture conditions. This conclusion is supported by the observation that treatment of C. arabica cell culture with CHX, a repressor of NMD, leads to a significant increase in TE expression (  Figure 3 ). In other words, the NMD regulatory systems that suppress TE expression remain active in C. arabica cell culture. Results reported here also underscore the importance of NMDrelated TE repression systems for the regulation of host genes. Indeed, NMD not only represses the expression of the TEs themselves (  Figure 3 ) but also appears to repress the expression of host genes that contain exonized TE sequences (  Figure 4) . This finding represents a novel molecular mechanism by which TE sequences can influence the regulation of Coffea host gens. Polyploid genomes are subjected to extensive changes, such as insertions/deletions, inversions and translocations, as well as alterations in gene expression patterns  [33] ,  [34] . Although the mechanisms of these changes are poorly understood, increasing TE transpositional activity is a possibility since quiescent TEs in a diploid genome can become activated in the new polyploid genetic environment. Additionally, the genetic redundancy in a polyploid genome can mitigate the deleterious effects of transposition  [35] , thereby allowing TEs to proliferate in allotetraploids and insert within gene-rich chromosomal regions. Another possibility is the relaxation of host silencing mechanisms (e.g., methylation) in allotetraploids, which should also allow for increased transposition rates  [36] . These factors may explain the increase in transposon copy number and their more prevalent interstitial chromosomal location we observed in the allotetraploid C. arabica compared to its parents, C. canephora and C. eugenioides. Coffea arabica and C. canephora showed a low TE-like mRNA abundance; only 0.17% of ESTs were expressed TEs (320 out of 181,405 ESTs). This low abundance has also been observed in other plant genomes. For an example, 60% of the Z. mays genome is composed of retroelements, but only 0.014% of these retroelements (56 out of 407,000 ESTs) were identified as expressed  [37] . However, a recent systematic search in the maize transcriptome showed that 1.5% of its ESTs  (25, 282  ESTs out of more than 2 million) were similar to 56 well characterized TE families  [18] . In Saccharum officinarum, out of 260,781 ESTs, 276 (0.1%) were considered to be expressed TEs  [38] . Finally, in Eucalyptus grandis, out of 123,889 ESTs, 124 (0.1%) were identified as transcriptionally active TEs  [39] . Our data reinforce the fact , with terminal, interstitial and proximal signals. Arrows indicate interstitial/proximal sites. This same probe hybridized preferentially clustered signals in C. eugenioides, with scattered signals in two pairs (D) and only clustered terminal signals in C. canephora (G). The Tip100 probe showed 36 hybridization sites in C. arabica var. typica (B), with chromosomes containing three sites (arrows) and two hybridization sites in terminal and proximal/interstitial regions (arrowheads). The same probe showed only eight chromosomes with terminal sites in C. eugenioides (E) and 14 chromosomes with signals in C. canephora (H). Note that four chromosomes exhibit two signals, being terminal and interstitial (arrows) and double terminal (arrowheads). The Del1 probe hybridized in 20 chromosomes in C. arabica var. typica (C). In only eight of them clustered signals were observed (arrows). From 12 chromosomes with signals observed in C. eugenioides (F), only two presented scattered ones (arrows). For C. canephora (I), this probe showed two pairs with scattered signals and evident terminal signals in six chromosomes (arrows). Bar represents 10 mm. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0078931.g005 that TEs are poorly represented in the Coffea transcriptome, although plant genomes are enriched by those repetitive sequences. This paradox reflects the strong host repression of TE transcriptional and transpositional activity in plants, as is illustrated by the paucity of TEs in Coffea transcriptomes and the heterochromatic distribution of most Coffea TE sequences. Nevertheless, transcriptional activation of several plant retrotransposons under stress has been shown and it seems that these mobile sequences have adapted to their host genomes through the evolution of highly regulated promoters that mimic those of the stress-induced plant genes (see  [14] , for a review). Moreover, it has been also shown, as for example with Tnt1 in tobacco, that subfamilies of the same retrotransposon show different stressassociated patterns of expression  [40] . Here, in a broader analysis of TE expression, we demonstrate that differing plant drought stress levels relate strongly to the changes in TE expression levels observed upon changes in irrigation conditions. Drought stress conditions were evaluated here in terms of predawn leaf water potentials Y pd . In coffee (as in many other plants), Y pd values close to 0 (.20.4 MPa) are observed for unstressed plants, while more negative values (,20.4 MPa) characterize drought stress. In other words, more highly negative Y pd values reflect higher levels of drought stress. Thus, the observed Y pd value of 20.80 MPa for C.arabica cv. Iapar59 is considered to show moderate drought stress, whereas the 23.02 MPa Y pd value of C. canephora clone 14 is considered to show severe drought stress  [41, 42] . Both of these drought tolerant Coffea cultivars show higher expression in the non-irrigated conditions (  Figure 3) . Interestingly, the opposite pattern was observed for drought sensitive cultivars from C. arabica, which showing significantly higher levels of TE expression in irrigated conditions  (Figure 3 ). Given the presumed effects of genomic environment on the expression of individual TE transcripts noted above, these divergent phenomena may relate to the overall state of the particular plant genome with respect to its ideal drought-related growth and regulatory conditions. In drought sensitive plants, TE expression levels go down in drought conditions consistent with an overall depression of genomic regulatory activity. On other hand, TE expression is up-regulated upon drought conditions in drought tolerant plants presumably consistent with the ideal growth/regulatory conditions of these cultivars. 
 Materials and Methods The ESTs used in our study are derived from libraries of the Brazilian Coffee Genome Project, hereafter called PGCB (http:// www.lge.ibi.unicamp.br/cafe), which contain partial sequences of cDNA of a wide range of tissues (e.g., seeds, embryogenic calli, roots, leaves, flowers), developmental stages and plant material submitted to biotic (e.g., stems infected with Xylella spp and nematodes) and abiotic (e.g., water deficit) stress conditions  [43, 22] . They comprises 131,150 ESTs from thirty-one cDNA libraries of C. arabica and 50,255 ESTs from eight cDNA libraries of C. canephora (12,332 obtained from 2 Brazilian Coffee Genome Project libraries plus 37,923 of six libraries from Lin et al. 2005  [44] , deposited at the SOL Genomics Network http://www.sgn. cornell.edu/content/coffee.pl). These ESTs were analyzed with two main objectives: (1) to characterize the classes, types and numbers of expressed TEs, and to investigate their expression; and 2) to investigate the impact of fragments of TEs (TE-cassettes) inserted in coding regions of both species comparing the expression of sequences harboring TE-cassettes and homologous sequences not harboring TE-cassettes (likely paralogous sequences). 
 Construction of a Permanent cDNA Library of Clones of Interest To characterize the expression profiles of active TEs and to evaluate putative differences in expression of transcripts containing TE-cassettes compared to their isoforms without TEs, the 242 cDNA clones of interest (64 of expressed TEs, 86 of unigenes with TE-cassettes and their 77 of isoforms without TEs) were trimmed from the PGCB libraries. Multiplication of 3 mL of bacteria culture containing each cDNA insert, cryopreserved in glycerol (50% v/v) and kept at 280uC was allowed in deepwell plates with 1.2 ml LB liquid culture medium for. After growth, 75 mL was removed to construct a permanent library with only the cultures of interest, followed by the purification and cloning of DNA plasmids. 
 Identification of Expressed TEs Expressed TEs were identified in 181,405 ESTs (libraries of C. arabica plus of C. canephora). The transcripts were considered likely to represent a transcriptionally active element when the TE sequence occupied more than 70% of an EST or unigene. EST clusters that were similar to expressed TEs were not considered because they may represent the mRNA assemblies of distinct insertions. Searches for the transcriptionally active TEs were performed using keywords such as ''transposon'', ''transposase'', ''polyprotein'', ''retrotransposon'', ''retroposon'', ''MITEs'', ''LINEs'', ''SINEs'' and family names (e.g., ''hAT'', ''MuDR'', ''En/Spm'') of the ESTs. A BLASTx  [45]  comparison of the ESTs with TE annotations against the protein sequences in the NCBI NR (non-redundant) database was then performed. Many BLAST hits were obtained. To eliminate spurious and unreliable results, a stringent cut-off (E = 1e 230 ) was applied. The resulting transcripts were classified into families according to the best alignment by BLASTx or tBLASTx  [45]  against a completely characterized library of 96 reference TEs  (Table S3  in File S2), as well as against 840 consensus TEs of phylogenetic species close to Coffea (e.g., Vitis vinifera, Populus trichocarpa, Solanum lycopersicum, and Solanum tuberosum) obtained from the dicotyledonous plant library Repbase (www.girinst.com). When ESTs or unigene sequences were annotated by the alignment with more than one reference TE from different plant TE databases, the matches between Coffea transcripts and reference TEs with the higher RM score was chosen. The frequencies of retrotransposons and transposons, as well as expressed TEs of the Ty-Copia and Ty3-Gypsy superfamilies were compared using a x 2 test. From the set of 100 clones homologous to TEs of C. arabica  (Table S1  in File S1), 64 were cloned into pSPORT1 vector, and sequenced using the BigDyeH Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using the universal primers M13F (59-GTAAAACGACGGCCAG-39) and M13R (59-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-39) as well as through internal primers specific to each clone and run on a 3730xl DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The sequences were clustered using CodonCode Aligner v.3.5.6 (www.codoncode.com), and bases had a Phred quality $20. The identification notation of these active TEs was ''Ca_'' (for C. arabica), ''TE-'' (for transposable elements) plus ''three numerical digits'', for example Ca_TE_031. Full sequences were obtained for 27 of these clones and partial sequences (sizes over 50% of the total length) for the remaining 37. 
 Identification of Novel Cases of TEs Incorporated into Mature mRNAs from C. arabica and of Paralogous Sequences without TEs It has been shown that the choice of sequence similarity search methods to detect TE-derived sequences strongly influences the estimate of TE-cassettes that can be identified in protein coding regions  [46] . Hidden Markov model based searches followed by BLAST methods (tBLASTx R tBLASTn R BLASTx R BLASTp R BLASTn) and RepeatMasker are more sensitive in identifying exonized TEs. We used that protocol to identify novel TE-derived sequences in protein coding sequences of Coffea in addition to those previously identified by RepeatMasker alone  [22] . A total of 131,150 ESTs from C. arabica were compared by tBLASTx  [45]  against 2,503 plant consensus TEs from Repbase  [27] . To avoid spurious results, only the best E#e 210 matches were accepted, without imposing additional scores or length thresholds. ESTs containing TEs were then compared to EST clusters of each species for the identification of their respective unigenes. They summed 145 cDNA clones containing TEcassettes (59 from C. arabica obtained in our previous study  [22]  plus 27 novel ones obtained in this study, and 59 from C. canephora), which were compared by BLASTn  [45]  against all cDNA clones of each species. This procedure allowed the identification of highly similar and thus likely paralogous unigenes without TEs. Examples of alignments between unigenes containing TEs and the highly     Table 3 . List of unigenes containing or not TE-cassette insertions identified in the transcriptome from C. arabica used as target in the macroarray analyses using as probe RNA samples from C. arabica. related unigenes using sequence similarity searches by BLASTn are given in  Figure S6  (File S4). 
 Unigenes containing TEs insertions 
 Expression Analyses The expression analyses were carried out for the 64 individual transcriptionally active TEs characterized in this study  (Table 2)  and for transcripts of CDSs harboring TE-cassettes (77) identified in this and in a previous study  [22]  and corresponding CDSs without TE insertions (63), identified in this study  (Table 3) . Plant material. For probe synthesis, total mRNA was extracted from the following samples of C. arabica: a) Drought stress: leaves of cultivars tolerant (Iapar59) and sensitive (Rubi) to drought grown in field conditions (Cerrado Agricultural Research Center, Planaltina-DF, Brazil) with (predawn leaf water potentials Y pd 20.3860.10 and 20.2260.07 MPa for Iapar59 and Rubi cultivars, respectively) and without (Y pd = 20.8060.12 and 21.8860.36 MPa for Iapar59 and Rubi cultivars, respectively) irrigation  [47] , b) Cell culture: embryogenic callus from C. arabica cv. Catuaí Vermelho maintained in a multiplication medium for ,4 months; c) Inhibition treatment: the same embryogenic callus was treated for 4 h with the protein biosynthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX: 10 and 30 mg/mL in alcohol) added to cell culture for a final concentration of 100 and 300 mg/mL. C. canephora var. conilon drought stress: clone 14, tolerant to drought was selected by the INCAPER  [41]  and grown in a greenhouse with (unstressed condition, Y pd leaves = 20.0260.03 MPa) or without (stress, Y pd leaves = 23.0260.12 MPa) water  [42] . For fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), slides were prepared with root tips of C. arabica var. typica, C. canephora and C. eugenioides pretreated with a saturated solution of paradichlorobenzene for 24 h at 14uC, without acid hydrolysis. RNA isolation, DNAse treatment and reverse transcription. RNA of all samples was extracted from cells using Concert TM reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA samples (10 mg) were incubated for 30 min at 37uC with 3 U of RQ1 RNAse-Free DNAse (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in a final volume of ,10 ml. Each total RNA sample was mixed with 1.5 ml Oligo(dT)  [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18]  (Invitrogen), heated at 75uC for 10 min, and then cooled for 5 min on ice. The reaction mixture for the reverse transcription contained 5 ml of 56first-strand buffer, 2.5 ml of 0.1 mol/l DTT, 40 U of RNAseOUT, 50 mCi (a-33 P)-dCTP and 2.5 ml of a 10 mM mixture of unlabeled dNTPs (dATP, dTTP and dGTP) and was heated at 42uC for 5 min. The reverse transcription was performed at 42uC for 20 min with 300 U of SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Then, 1.25 ml of unlabeled dCTP (10 mM) was added and maintained for 1 h, terminated by heating at 94uC for 5 min and cooled for 5 min on ice. The total volume (30.25 ml) was used in the hybridization experiments. Amplification of target DNA. Each target cDNA (100 ng) was amplified by PCR in a volume of 25 ml with 1.25 U of PlatinumH Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) in 106 polymerase buffer, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 200 mM each dNTP and 10 mM of each universal primer, M13F and M13R. The solutions were heated to 94uC for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation (94uC for 30 sec), annealing (50uC for 30 sec), extension (72uC for 4 min), and final extension at 72uC for 7 min. The target DNAs were used to make the membrane arrays. Macroarray experiments and analysis. The PCR products of the target DNAs were denatured in DMSO (50% v/v) for 30 min at 37uC, arrayed in a 384-well microtiter plate and then spotted twice in the same position onto Performa II nylon filters (Genetix Limited, Hampshire, UK) using the high-throughput robot system Q-BOT (Genetix Limited). To increase the signal homogeneity among spots and filters, the set of 64 cDNAs was spotted in duplicate (262 array) onto two identical arrays using the same nylon filters (2226222 mm). Additionally, 16 spots containing cDNA of the reference gene ubiquitin were applied to delimit the two arrays. After sample deposition, the filters were dampened with a denaturant solution (NaCl 0.13 M and 0.5 M NaOH) for 10 min and a neutralization solution (NaCl 1.5 M and Tris 1 M) for 5 min, then fixed by UV light exposition (1,200 mj/cm 2 ) for 12 sec and stored at 280uC. The filters were pre-hybridized for 2 h at 65uC in Modified Church and Gilbert Buffer (0.5 M Na Phosphate Buffer pH 7.2, 7% SDS, 10 mM EDTA) and hybridized overnight with cDNA sample probes. Membranes were washed for 15 min three times with 0.1% SDS/16SSC and three times with 0.1% SDS/0.16SSC at 65uC. After washing, the filters were exposed on imaging plates BAS-MS 2340 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) for 72 h in a BAS 2340 cassette (Fujifilm) and scanned using a fluorescent image analyzer FLA3000 (Fujifilm). The radioactive intensity of each spot was quantified by Array Gauge software (Fujifilm), corrected by the level of the local background, normalized to the average intensities of the reference gene ubiquitin (except for callus treated with CHX, in which the reference gene expression was completely suppressed). For differences in probe labeling, normalization was by use of the average signals of all genes studied. The homogeneity of the spot replicates were evaluated and represented by average values using limma of the Bioconductor package  [48]  from R (http://www.rproject.org). The resulting normalized expression levels for individual probes, expressed as signal intensity values, were visualized, clustered and statistically analyzed across all conditions assayed here. Signal intensity values of individual transcripts were visualized and hierarchically clustered using the TIGR Multiexperiment viewer (MeV) program (http://www.tm4.org/mev. html). Average expression levels between conditions were compared using both parametric (Student's ttest) and nonparametric (Mann-Whitney U test) statistical tests. Differences in condition-specific expression profiles for individual transcripts were computed using Manhattan distances between signal intensity vectors across conditions. The resulting distances were averaged within and between TE classes and families to measure TE expression coherence. 
 Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization FISH was performed as described elsewhere  [49]  with modifications. Three expressed TE cDNA clones (GI 311206994, GI 315896428 and GI 315862857 similar to MuDR, Tip100 and del1, respectively) were used to synthesize the probes with biotin-14-dATP by nick translation. The reaction mixture (total volume 33 ml) contained 15 ml of 100% formamide, 6 ml of polyethylene glycol, 3 ml of 206SSC, 1 ml of calf thymus DNA (100 ng), 4 ml of water and 4 ml of each probe (200 ng). The samples were denatured at 70uC for 10 min, and hybridization was performed at 37uC overnight in a humidified chamber. The washes were carried out in 66SSC and 46SSC/0.2% Tween 20 at room temperature. The probes were detected with avidin-FITC, followed by post-detection washes in 46SSC/0.2% Tween 20 at room temperature. Slides were mounted with 25 ml of antifade, composed of glycerol (90%), 1,4-diaza-bicyclo(2,2,2)octane(2.3%), 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 (2%), water and 1 ml of 2 mg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The images were acquired using a Leica DM4500 B Microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a DFC 300FX Digital Color Camera (Leica Microsystems), and the image was overlapped with red color for DAPI using the Leica IM50 4.0 image management software (Leica Microsystems).

 are presented in Tables S5 & S6 in File S5, respectively. Each unigene cluster contains sequences that represent a unique gene resulting from assembling of various ESTs. Rescreening the ESTs of C.arabica against the library of 2,503 consensus TEs from RepBase yielded 421 TE-containing ESTs. Due to the high number of matches, only those with Evalues,e 210 were analyzed, resulting in 303 matches. A comparison of these TE-containing ESTs against the database of unigenes (EST clusters) in the LGE database revealed 27 new TE-derived protein CDSs in C. arabica (Table S5 in File S5). All of the CDSs matched with proteins with a clearly defined function, namely protein factors related to transcriptional and spliceosomal machinery, chaperones and alcohol dehydrogenase.

BB of cotton was first reported in the United States by Atkinson, who described several symptoms, such as angular leaf spots, water-soaked lesions, stem black arm, boll rot, and plantlet burning (1). In the second half of the 20th century, BB became a limiting factor of fiber production in all major cotton-producing regions of Africa, Asia, Australia, and North America  (2) . The use of resistant cultivars is usually the most efficient way to manage disease. However, resistance was repeatedly overcome by the appearance of new races. More than 20 races have been described, including highly virulent strains that were isolated in Central Africa in the 1980s  (2) . To better understand the molecular basis of provoking disease and of triggering defense responses and to develop new molecular markers for epidemiological surveillance, we sequenced the genomes of two strains originating from Burkina Faso and belonging to the highly virulent race 20 and the less virulent race 18  (3) . Both strains were sequenced using the Illumina Hi-Seq2000 platform (GATC Biotech, Germany). The shotgun sequencing yielded 40,654,599 read pairs (29,066,551 100-bp paired-end reads with an insert size of 250 bp and 11,588,048 50-bp mate-pair reads with an insert size of 3 kb) and 43,359,649 read pairs (19,340,592 100-bp paired-end reads and 24,019,057 50-bp matepair reads) for strains X18 and X20, respectively. A combination of Velvet (4), SOAPdenovo, and SOAPGapCloser (5) yielded 22 contigs larger than 500 bp (N 50 , 705,301 bp), with the largest contig of 2,062 kb, for a total assembly size of 4,989,917 bp for strain X18 and 17 contigs larger than 500 bp  (N 50 , 1,006,603 bp) , with the largest scaffold of 1,770 kb, for a total assembly size of 5,216,199 bp for strain X20. Multilocus sequence analyses of six housekeeping genes described earlier for xanthomonads confirmed that strains X18 and X20 belong to X. citri pv. malvacearum (2,745 bp with 100% identity) (6), corresponding to DNA-DNA homology group 9.5, which also includes X. citri pv. citri (2,730 identical residues) and X. citri pv. glycines (2,729 identical residues)  (7) . The genome encodes a canonical type III protein secretion system (8) and several type III effectors, including transcriptional activator-like (TAL) effectors, which are responsible for symptom formation and avirulence reactions on cotton  (9) . The availability of two genome sequences of X. citri pv. malvacearum will critically aid in developing new molecular typing tools for epidemiological surveillance and guiding breeding programs based on rapid and accurate identification of predominant lineages. Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. These wholegenome shotgun projects have been deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers ATMA00000000 for strain X18 and ATMB00000000 for strain X20.

Rivers do not merely transport C from the terrestrial biome  10  to the oceanic environment, but also bury and process organic matter, and generally acting as a source of CO 2 to the atmosphere  (Cole and Caraco, 2001; Mayorga et al., 2005; Cole et al., 2007) . Although the riverine C flux may be small compared to the gross global fluxes between ocean-atmosphere (90 Pg C yr −1 ) and terrestrialatmosphere (120 Pg C yr −1 ) interfaces  (Schlünz and Schneider, 2000; Prentice et al., 15 2001; Houghton, 2004; Sabine et al., 2004) , the fluvial C flux transport is of the same order as the respective net ecosystem production (2.2 Pg C yr −1 )  (Cole and Caraco, 2001; Cole et al., 2007; Battin et al., 2008; Aufdenkampe et al., 2011) . Riverine systems transport C mainly in form of dissolved organic C (DOC), particulate organic C (POC) and dissolved inorganic C (DIC). Globally, rivers discharge into  20  the world's ocean approximately 0.5 Pg C yr −1 as DIC and about 0.4 Pg C yr −1 as organic C with about one-half each as POC and DOC  (Meybeck, 1993; Probst et al., 1994; Ludwig et al., 1996; Schlünz and Schneider, 2000) . Fluvial C fluxes (i.e., C yields) may differ strongly among individual rivers due to the naturally large variation in variables such as catchment slopes, vegetation, geology, climate and size  (Hope 25 et al., 1994) . The global sediment yield of rivers is estimated at 160-180 t km −2 yr Introduction in pre-dammed conditions  (Vörösmarty et al., 2003) . However, most current C flux estimates do not account for human impact such as retention of material in reservoirs, hence, actual sediment load and POC transport to the oceans may be lower because of increased damming of rivers  (Vörösmarty et al., 2003) . Further, recent estimates of CO 2 outgassing from streams and rivers suggests land-derived organic matter may  5  be oxidized in a matter of days or weeks on its transit along fluvial ecosystems  (Battin et al., 2008) . Riverine POC is mainly derived from soils, litterfall and autochthonous production while DOC arises from degradation of organic matter in the soil, leaching of plant litter and, to a lesser degree, from the contribution of autochthonous biological processes  10  occurring in the stream  (Meybeck, 1993; Ludwig et al., 1996; Finlay and Kendall, 2007) . Globally, riverine DOC fluxes are dependent on drainage intensity, basin slope and to a larger extent, the amount of C stored in soils, while POC on the other hand is a function of TSM fluxes which principally depend on drainage intensity, rainfall intensity and basin slope  (Ludwig et al., 1996) . The global riverine POC fluxes have been estimated  15  based on modeled global sediment fluxes and %POC versus TSM relationships  (Meybeck, 1982 (Meybeck, , 1993 Ittekkot, 1988; Ludwig et al., 1996; Mayorga et al., 2010) . In the majority of rivers, the POC content of TSM ranges between 1 and 20 %, but it can exceptionally reach 0.5 % for highly turbid rivers, or values greater than 20 % for lowland rivers draining swamps.  20  The origin of riverine organic C is commonly categorized as either allochthonousderived from terrestrial organic matter or autochthonous-derived from in-situ biological production  (Hope et al., 1994; Finlay and Kendall, 2007) . According to the river continuum concept  (Vannote et al., 1980) , the relative contribution of different sources to total OC varies with stream size, where allochthonous C is expected to be important in Introduction conceptual models for describing energy and C flows in rivers have been developed, such as the flood pulse concept  (Junk et al., 1989) , the serial discontinuity concept (Ward and  Stanford, 1983) , the resource-spiraling concept  (Elwood et al., 1983) , the hyporheic corridor concept  (Stanford and Ward, 1993) , and the riverine ecosystem synthesis model  (Thorp et al., 2006) . Of particular relevance for the present study, the 5 serial discontinuity concept accounts for disturbances in river flow such as congestion by dams, while the flood pulse concept accounts for the exchange of material with surrounding flooded plains. While the early descriptions  (Vannote et al., 1980)  of C flows in terms of production-consumption (i.e. autrophy-heterotrophy) were limited to primary producers and invertebrates interactions, the most recent conceptual models  10  give increasing weight to the role of microbes in cycling C in riverine systems  (Battin et al., 2008) . Tropical rivers account for 60 % of estimated global riverine C flux and 34 % of the sediment delivery to the global oceans  (Ludwig et al., 1996; Ludwig and Probst, 1998; Schlünz and Schneider, 2000) . In view of the increasingly recognized importance of  15  freshwater ecosystems in the C cycle  (Cole et al., 2007; Battin et al., 2008; Tranvik et al., 2009; Aufdenkampe et al., 2011) , and considering the disproportionate role tropical rivers have in global riverine C export, the biogeochemistry of tropical rivers merits particular attention. Given the relative scarcity of data, this requires both a better quantification of material (export) fluxes, as well as multi-proxy studies on the origin and Introduction about −28 and −13 ‰, respectively  (Still and Powell, 2010; Kohn, 2010) . Freshwater autotrophs such as phytoplankton can have a wide range of δ 13 C signatures (−42 to −19 ‰ according to  Finlay and Kendall, 2007)  depending e.g., on the δ 13 C values of DIC. Thus, stable isotopes have frequently been used, in combination with other prox-5 ies such as elemental ratios (POC : PN) and/or POC : chlorophyll-a ratios, to constrain the relative contribution of different organic matter sources (autochthonous vs. allochthonous), and to understand C fluxes and the fate of terrigenous C in river systems  (Kendall et al., 2001; Finlay and Kendall, 2007) . Radionuclides, particularly 7 Be, 210 Pb and 137 Cs have been applied as tracers to identify source regions of sediments,  10  quantify residence and settling times of particles within a given riverine basin, as well as understanding aspects of fluvial sediment erosion, transport, deposition and resuspension . Both 7 Be (t 1/2 = 53.3 d) and 210 Pb (t 1/2 = 22.3 yr) are washed from the atmosphere and delivered to the earth surface through both wet and dry fallout and both sorb strongly to particles, hence, they qualify as tracers of sedi-15 ment origin  (Bonniwell et al., 1999; Matisoff et al., 2002; Saari et al., 2010) . The ratio of 7 Be/ 210 Pb xs in suspended sediments reflects the age of sediment (i.e. the time since the sediment received both 7 Be and 210 Pb xs from atmospheric deposition) and can be used to quantify the proportion of resuspended bottom material in the water column  (Olsen et al., 1986) . Thus, a decrease in the 7 Be/ 210 Pb xs ratio reflects an increase  20  in the time since the sediment was ""tagged"" with atmospherically derived 7 Be and 210 Pb xs , since 7 Be has a much shorter half-life than 210 Pb. Alternatively, a decrease in this ratio may reflect dilution of 7 Be-rich sediment with 7 Be-deficient old sediment . The present study focuses on the distribution and origin of organic C pools in Introduction characterising riverine organic C at the scale of an entire tropical river catchment, and will provide the background for the interpretation of complementary data on greenhouse gas fluxes, nutrient and inorganic C dynamics which will be discussed elsewhere. 
 Materials and methods

 Study area The Tana River is the longest river in Kenya (∼ 1300 km), with a total catchment area of ∼ 130 000 km 2 (  Fig. 1 )  (Kitheka et al., 2005) . The basin experiences a bimodal hydrological cycle, with long rains between March and May, and short rains between October and December. The river system can be separated into two main parts, here referred 10 to as the ""Tana headwaters"" and the ""lower main Tana"". The Tana headwaters encompass a set of small mountainous streams that form the perennial source of the Tana River, and which originate from the Aberdares Range in the central highlands of Kenya, the highlands around Mount Kenya, and the Nyambene Hills in Eastern Kenya. The lower main  Tana encompasses the section downstream of the Nyambene Hills, where   15  the river continues for about ∼ 800 km through semi-arid plains. Along this stretch, tributaries only discharge in short pulses during the wet season. As a result, the lower main Tana forms a single transport channel during the dry season, delivering material to the Indian Ocean  (Maingi and Marsh, 2002) . Along the lower main Tana, extensive floodplains are found between the towns of Garissa and Garsen  (Fig. 1 ). Yet, flooding 20 is irregular in recent decades, as the river flow is regulated by five hydro-electric dams upstream  (Maingi and Marsh, 2002) . The associated reservoirs have a combined surface area of 150 km 2 , and a substantial amount of sediment is trapped behind these dams  (Dunne and Ongweny, 1976; Schneider and Brown, 1998) . The mean annual river discharge is 156 m 3 s −1 as measured at Garissa gauging station  (Fig. 2)   
 Sampling and analytical techniques Water, sediment and soil sampling was carried out during four campaigns in February 2008 (dry season), September-November 2009 (wet season), and June-July 2010 (end of wet season), and October/November 2011 (wet season). Samples were taken throughout the river basin (  Fig. 1  -Supplement  Table 1 ), and sampling sites included a subset of small streams in the headwater regions, an approximately equidistant set of locations along the main lower Tana, and two of the five hydro-electric reservoirs (Masinga and Kamburu). The first field survey in February 2008 only covered a subset of these field sites. The associated water column data have already been presented in  Bouillon et al. (2009)  and only the data on soils and riverine sediments are further detailed here. In both the 2009 and 2010 campaigns, an extensive basin-wide survey was carried out. During the follow-up fieldtrip in October/November 2011, depth profiles of river bank soils were collected at several sites along the lower Tana River. Samples for total suspended matter were taken by filtration of a known volume of surface water on 47 mm GF/F filters (nominal porosity = 0.7 µm), which were pre-weighed  15  and pre-combusted (overnight at 450 • C), and which were dried and re-weighed after filtration. Samples for POC, particulate nitrogen (PN), and δ 13 C POC were obtained in a similar way by filtering a known volume of surface water on pre-combusted 25 mm GF/F filters (0.7 µm) and drying. In the laboratory, these filters were exposed to HCl fumes for 4 h to remove inorganic C, and the residue was re-dried and packed in  20  Ag cups. Top soil samples (surface 0-5 cm layer) were collected at all sampling sites (except the Masinga and Kamburu reservoirs), slightly upstream from the water sampling location and ∼ 10 m from the river bank. Along the main Tana River, riverbed sediments were sampled with a Van Veen grab, while in the shallow headwater streams, sedi- Discussion Paper | Discussion Paper | Discussion Paper | Discussion Paper | sediment cores (up to 30 cm) were taken at the lowest sites accessible, and within the zone where clear, thick sediment deposits were present. In the same campaign, the Van Veen grab was used to retrieve surface sediment from the Kamburu reservoir. All soil and sediment samples were stored in liquid N 2 during transport, and upon return to the laboratory, they were preserved at −20 • C until further analysis. In the laboratory, 5 sediment and soil samples were ground and homogenized using a mortar and pestle. A weighed subsample was transferred into a Ag cup to which a 10 % HCl solution was added to remove all carbonates. The samples were then dried at 60 • C for 24 h, and if necessary, the procedure was repeated. POC, PN, and δ 13 C POC from filters, soil and sediment samples were determined 10 on a Thermo elemental analyzer-isotope ratio mass spectrometer (EA-IRMS) system (various configurations, either Flash1112, FlashHT with Delta+XL or DeltaV Advantage), using the thermal conductivity detector (TCD) signal of the elemental analyzer (EA) to quantify POC and PN, and by monitoring 44, 45, and 46 m/z signal on the isotope-ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS). Quantification and calibration of δ 13 C data  15  was performed with IAEA-C6 and acetanilide which was internally calibrated vs. international standards. Reproducibility of δ 13 C POC measurements was typically better than ±0.2 ‰. Samples for dissolved organic C (DOC) and δ 13 C DOC were obtained by prefiltering surface water through pre-combusted GF/F filters (0.7 µm), with further filtra-20 tion through 0.2 µm syringe filters, and were preserved with H 3 PO 4 in glass vials with teflon-coated screw caps. DOC and δ 13 C DOC were measured with either a customized Thermo HiperTOC coupled to a Delta+XL IRMS  (Bouillon et al., 2006) , or by manual injection in a Thermo IsoLink HPLC-IRMS (similar to the method described in  Albéric, 2011) . Samples for pigment analysis were obtained by filtering a known volume of sur-25 face water on pre-combusted 47 mm GF/F filters, which were immediately packed in cryotubes and stored in liquid N 2 . Upon return to the laboratory, these were stored at −20 • C until further analysis. Pigments were extracted in 10 ml acetone : water mixture   (Bouillon et al., 2009) . Calibration was performed with working standards prepared from commercially available pure compounds. Surface area (SA) measurements were made on 200-600 mg freeze-dried and homogenized samples of soils, sediments and TSM, using multi-point Brunauer-Emmet-Teller adsorption isotherms  (Brunauer et al., 1938) . Measurements were made using 5 a 25 Quantachrome NOVA 3000 SA analyzer, and verified with BCR-173 (Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements). Samples for radionuclide analysis were obtained by filtering a known volume of surface water on 102 mm polycarbonate membrane filters. The activities of 7 Be, 210 Pb and 226 Ra were determined on the dried suspended matter using a low background-10 high efficiency well type γ-counter placed in a lead shield and protected from cosmic ray using an anti-cosmic shielding made of plastic scintillators  (Schmidt et al., 2009 ). Standards used for calibration of the γ-detector were IAEA standards (RGU-1; RGTh-1; IAEA-314). 7 Be values were corrected for radioactive decay that occurred between sample collection and counting. Excess 210 Pb ( 210 Pb xs ) was calculated by subtract-  15  ing the activity supported by parent isotope 226 Ra from the total activity measured in particles.

 15 Concentrations of POC ranged from 0.3 to 5.8 mg l −1 , 0.23 to 119.8 mg l −1 and 0.4 to 12.6 mg l −1 during dry season, wet season and end of wet-season, respectively (Supplement  Table 1  The organic C content (%OC) of the suspended matter ranged from 1.1 to 49.8 %, 0.9 to 32.1 % and 1.2 to 37.9 % for dry season, wet season and end of wet season campaigns, respectively (Supplement  Table 1 ), and the organic C content decreased downstream  (Fig. 3b ). TSM and %OC showed an inverse relationship during the three Discussion Paper | Discussion Paper | Discussion Paper | Discussion Paper | seasons (p < 0.01). POC/PN ratios were significantly lower during the wet season (9.6 ± 2.5) as compared to end of wet season (12.1 ± 4.3) and dry-season (10.5 ± 2.6) datasets. The δ 13 C POC values ranged from −26.5 to −21.2 ‰, −31.8 to −19.9 ‰, and −27.1 to −21.4 ‰ with means of −23.8 ± 1.6 ‰, −24.7 ± 2.8 ‰ and −24.3 ± 1.6 ‰ during dry 5 season, wet season and end of wet-season campaigns, respectively (Supplement Table 1). The values for different seasons were not significantly different (paired t-test , p > 0.05). Generally, the δ 13 C POC values increased downstream during all the three sampling campaigns (p < 0.01)  (Fig. 4a) . Overall, the δ 13 C POC values during the three seasons were not significantly different for the three headwaters and so were the values   
 Dissolved organic carbon and δ 13 C DOC DOC concentrations ranged from 0.3 to 2.5 mg l −1 , 0.2 to 6.4 mg l −1 and 2.1 to 6.9 mg l −1 for dry season, wet season and end of wet season campaigns, respectively (Supplement  Table 1    Fig. 7a ). 
 Soil and sediment carbon pools Data on organic C content of soils and riverine sediments were combined for the three sampling campaigns. The soil organic C ranged between 0.03 to 20.2 %, (Supplement  Table 2 ), with a mean basin-wide value of 3.5 ± 3.9. Similarly, the organic C content of  15  riverine sediment (%OC) ranged from 0.01 to 5.7 % with a basin-wide mean of 1.3±2.6 (Supplement  Table 2 ). Both the soil and sediment C content decreased consistently downstream (Pearson correlation, p < 0.01;  Fig. 3b ). Soil and sediment values were significantly different (paired t-test, p > 0.05). The δ 13 C values of the soil organic C pool show a weak positive correlation with altitude (Pearson correlation, r 2 = 0.23; 20 p < 0.05), ranging overall between −28.5 and −13.2 ‰ (Supplement  Table 2 ). The δ 13 C data of the riverine sediment showed a slightly smaller range (between −27.8 and −16.2 ‰ -Supplement  Table 2 ) and did not show a systematic pattern with altitude (Pearson correlation, p > 0.05). Overall, %OC from river bank soil depth profiles ranged between 0.05 to 1.7 %  25  whereas δ 13 C values ranged between −26.1 and −11.9 ‰ (Supplement  Table 5  Primate and Garsen sites (Pearson correlation, p < 0.05) but no systematic patterns could be discerned at the Garissa and Hola sites (Pearson correlation, p > 0.05). Sediment %OC on cores from Masinga Reservoir ranged from 1.1 to 1.9 % (Supplement  Table 3 ) and although concentrations differed between the cores, they generally decreased with depth  (Fig. 9a) ; while that of surface sediments in Kamburu Reservoir 5 was 1.84 %. The δ 13 C values from Masinga cores ranged between −19.6 and −15.7 ‰ (Supplement  Table 3 ), and increased consistently with depth (  Fig. 9b)  whereas the single sample from Kamburu reservoir surface sediments was −20.7 ‰. 
 Specific surface areas Specific SA ranged between 2.4 to 98.2 m 2 g −1 , 0.9 to 105 m 2 g −1 and 39.9 to 10 82.3 m 2 g −1 for soil, riverine sediment and suspended matter, respectively (Supplement  Table 4 ). The SA for soils and riverine sediments decreased consistently downstream while those of suspended matter increased downstream (Pearson correlation, p < 0.01;  Fig. 8a ). Sediment %OC and SA were positively correlated (Pearson correlation, p < 0.01;  Fig. 8b ) but soil and suspended matter were not correlated (p > 0.05).  15  The SA values from the Masinga and Kamburu reservoir sediments were notably high, and ranged between 59.8 to 93.8 m 2 g −1 (Supplement  Tables 3 and 4 ). The OC : SA ratios ranged between 0.1 to 14.6 mg OC m −2 , 0.1 to 7.1 mg OC m −2 and 0.2 to 0.5 mg OC m −2 for soil, sediment and suspended matter, respectively (Supplement  Table 4 ). Generally, soil OC : SA ratios were significantly higher than riverine sediments 20 (p < 0.01). However, OC : SA ratios did not show a systematic pattern with altitude. The OC : SA ratios from Masinga and Kamburu dams sediment cores ranged between 0.16 to 0.25 mg OC m −2 (Supplement  Table 3 ). However, neither SA nor the OC : SA ratio exhibited a systematic pattern with core depth.

 Activities of radionuclides The particulate activity ratios of 7 Be/ 210 Pb xs ( 7 Be/ 210 Pb xs AR) ranged between 0.4 and 1.9 during wet season and increased consistently downstream (Pearson correlation, p < 0.05; R 2 = 0.76). During the end-of-wet-season campaign, values were higher (range between 1.0 to 4.5) and there was no systematic pattern downstream 5  (Fig. 10a) . However, the ratios were generally low in lower Tana sites, for example Hola and Sankuri sites compared to Ura river site in the middle of the Tana catchment. Generally, 7 Be/ 210 Pb xs ratios were highest during end of wet season compared to wet season. The 7 Be/ 210 Pb xs AR can be used to calculate the age of the sediments or the fraction of new sediments : 10 Age = 1 (λ7 Be − λ210 Pb ) ln AR 0 /AR (1) % new sediment = (AR/AR 0 ) × 100 (2) where λ7 Be and λ210 Pb are the decay constants of 7 Be (0.013 d −1 ) and 210 Pb (8.509 × 10 −5 d −1 ). AR and AR 0 are the 7 Be/ 210 Pb xs AR of suspended particles and of the atmospheric fallout, respectively. The age of particulate suspended matter (SPM)  (Fig. 10b   
 Sediment dynamics along the Tana River flow-path The average river discharge measured at Garissa station during the wet season campaign (208.5 m 3 s −1 ; October and November 2009) was 1.7 and 1.4 times higher than during the dry season (122.9 m 3 s −1 ; February 2008) and end-of-wet-season campaign  5  (145.2 m 3 s −1 ; June and July 2010), respectively. As expected  (Dunne and Ongweny, 1976; Kitheka et al., 2005) , TSM concentrations were highest during high-flow conditions of the wet season, in particular for the lower main Tana River. TSM profiles during all seasons studied show that, with few exceptions, high-altitude streams have relatively low TSM concentrations. Considering that the Tana River sustains several reservoirs 10 along its channel, a substantial amount of sediment is trapped, with Masinga and Kamburu dam alone estimated to retain ∼ 6.0 and 3.0 million t yr −1 , respectively  (Dunne and Ongweny, 1976; Schneider and Brown, 1998 and references therein) . Despite the presence of these reservoirs, high TSM values were recorded beyond the reservoirs in the lower main Tana. The TSM profile is much more variable during the wet season,  15  with several minima and maxima along the lower river course (see  Fig. 3 , note the log scale on the Y -axis). Sediment inputs could be expected from the ephemeral streams (lagas) during flash floods. Monthly sampling conducted by  Kitheka et al. (2005)  for two years between 2000 to 2003 recorded TSM concentrations in the range of 530 to 1930 mg l −1 at Garsen (see  Fig. 1  for location). The maximum of this range is much 20 lower than the value we recorded during our wet season campaign at the same site (5098 mg l −1 ). Compared to many other African river systems (e.g.,  Martins, 1983; Lesack et al., 1984; Seyler et al., 1995; Bird et al., 1998; Coynel et al., 2005 ; 1.7 to 135 mg l −1 ), the TSM concentrations encountered in the lower main Tana during the wet season were exceptionally high.  25  In the dry and post-wet season, TSM concentration data are lower than in the wet season, but still high compared to the headwaters, even right after the dams. Moreover, there is a very conspicuous strong increase in TSM in the lower main Tana  (Fig. 3a)  where the river flows through semi-arid plains for ∼ 800 km, and has no tributaries in the dry season. Based on data from the dry season sampling in 2008,  Bouillon et al. (2009)  suggested that this downstream increase in TSM during low flow conditions could be explained by resuspension of internally stored riverbed sediments. However, such a resuspension mechanism implies that the river bed must act as a sink of TSM dur-5 ing other period, i.e., during the wet season. Given the high current speeds and high TSM values recorded during our wet season campaign, it is unlikely that the river beds accumulates sediment during this period. Instead, the downstream increase in TSM below the reservoirs most likely shows that the lower Tana River is in a non-equilibrium state with respect to sediment transport. Past studies have documented similar im-10 pacts of upstream damming to downstream river networks  (Scodanibbio and Mañez, 2005) , such as river channel incision, associated river bank erosion and downstream sedimentation  (Rosgen, 1997) . In the case of the Tana river,  Maingi and Marsh (2002)  reported that following the construction of Masinga dam, river meandering rates have decreased and the river channel of the lower Tana has deepened. Our observations of 15 strongly increasing TSM concentrations during different stages of the hydrograph thus suggest that much of the sediment generated in the lower section of the Tana River, at least during periods of lower discharge, is derived from the collapse of incised and unstable river banks. The contribution of bank sediments in explaining the increasing TSM load along the  20  lower Tana River appears to be consistent with organic C data from river bank sediments. The high TSM loads coincide with lower %POC values and higher δ 13 C POC signatures, and a comparison with bank sediment data illustrates that these could represent an end-member consistent with observations on the riverine POC  (Fig. 11) . Variations in 7 Be/ 210 Pb xs ratios form an important tool for tracing suspended parti-25 cles along the river continuum  Saari et al., 2010) . In the context of identifying the sources of sediments in the lower Tana River, these data allow us to make an analysis of the relative importance of surface erosion (material with high 7 Be/ 210 Pb xs ratios) versus river bed resuspension or river bank collapse (material with   Whiting et al., 2005) . Although the number of samples is limited, our initial data appear to show contrasting patterns during wet and end of wet season conditions  (Fig. 10) . First, the wet season data from the main Tana River show a relatively clear downstream increase in 7 Be/ 210 Pb xs ratios  (Fig. 10a) , i.e., the age of the TSM load decreases or an increase of the fraction of new sediment. In fact these in-5 creasing 7 Be/ 210 Pb xs ratios coincide with the generally increasing TSM concentrations along this stretch of the river. This suggests that during wet season conditions, the increase in suspended load is due to recent erosion of surface soils. The ephemeral streams (lagas) draining the extensive semi-arid shrubland areas on the west bank of the lower main Tana could be the source of these high sediment inputs -even 10 though these ephemeral tributaries only discharge during very short periods of time. During our end of wet season campaign, conditions were similar to dry season, and different from the wet season. TSM concentrations show a consistent increase over the lower main Tana, and show a contrasting longitudinal profile of 7 Be/ 210 Pb xs ratios  (Fig. 10b) . Estimated sediment ages are much more variable, and older, with a maxi-15 mum of 478 days ( 7 Be/ 210 Pb xs = 0.02). This indicates that the longitudinal increase in TSM is not from recent surface erosion events, but consistent with resuspended river sediments and/or bank erosion. A contribution by river bank collapse would contribute 7 Be-deficient sediment to the river suspended matter load , since it brings in deeper soil layers with an older radionuclide signature. Internal resuspen-20 sion of river sediments would have a similar effect on 7 Be/ 210 Pb xs ratios, but as noted above, this mechanism is unlikely. Estimated contributions of new sediment in the lower Tana River (see Eq. 2) range between 3.6 and 16 % for the wet season sampling, and between 0.2 and 21 % for the end-of-wet season dataset.  25  The low δ 13 C POC values in the upstream reaches, in combination with high %POC and high POC : Chl-a ratios, suggests that POC is predominantly derived from C3 plant   (Cai et al., 1988; Aufdenkampe et al., 2001; Townsend-Small et al., 2005) , although a similar pattern has been reported in a tropical river system in Cameroon  (Bird et al., 1994b) . Such a downstream increase in δ 13 C POC could result from a combination of 5 two processes: (i) altitudinal differences in the δ 13 C signature of C3 vegetation, and/or (ii) a shift towards a higher contribution of C4 vegetation at lower altitudes. Regarding the first mechanism, δ 13 C values of C3 plants have been reported to increase with decreasing mean annual precipitation (MAP) (e.g.,  Kohn, 2010) . The rainfall pattern in Tana River basin decreases from 2200 mm yr −1 at high altitudes to 450 mm yr −1 in 10 lower and drier Tana catchment  (Schneider and Brown, 1998) . Employing these precipitation data together with the empirical relationship between altitude, precipitation and δ 13 C of C3 vegetation established by  Kohn (2010) , the average C3 vegetation is expected to have average signatures of −28.7 and −26.5 ‰ for the highest and lowest altitudes, respectively, i.e. a shift of +2.2 ‰. This shift is much smaller than the 15 observed shift of ∼ 7 ‰ in our dataset,  (Fig. 4a ). This indicates that the downstream increase in δ 13 C values is to a large extent due to increased contributions from C4 vegetation or C4-dominated soil organic matter. One notable exception to this elevational pattern is the much higher than expected C4 contribution at some of the high altitude sites (Aberdares, Mt. Kenya), where both the POC and DOC show distinctly higher 20 δ 13 C signatures (Figs. 4a and 5b). This observed C4 contribution is explained by the frequent occurrence of Andropogon amethystinus, a tussock-forming C4 grass species for which our δ 13 C measurements range between −13.64 and −12.14 ‰,  (Tieszen et al., 1979; Wooller et al., 2001  contribution in the POC pool in the lower main Tana is surprisingly high (63 %), despite the open savannah vegetation in the lower altitude Tana basin probably due to contribution from riverine forest. Past studies from other tropical rivers suggest minimal contribution of POC from algal sources in fluvial systems  (Bird et al., 1994a,b) . The δ 13 C signatures for POC at Masinga  (Bouillon et al., 2009)  and Kamburu dams showed  5  depleted δ 13 C values, low POC/Chl-a ratios, high %POC and low POC/PN ratios, thus reflecting POC contributions from algal sources (Supplement  Table 1 ;  Fig. 4a,b) . This effect was particularly more pronounced during dry season campaign  (Bouillon et al., 2009 ). Yet, in our riverine samples, there is a negligible contribution of phytoplankton to the POC pool as confirmed by the absence of positive correlations between δ 13 C signatures of POC and those of algae-specific phospholipid fatty acid markers (20 : 5ω3 and 18 : 3ω3), while these markers show an excellent correlation with δ 13 C data of dissolved inorganic C (Van den Meersche and Tamooh, unpublished data). 
 Longitudinal changes in riverine organic carbon cycling The δ 13 C values for Masinga dam sediment cores were surprisingly high  (−19.5  to −17.3 ‰) and inconsistent with the values measured in tributaries feeding into the  15  Masinga reservoir  (Fig. 7b) . These signatures similarly do not match the phytoplankton in the reservoir (grey symbols in  Fig. 7b ), suggesting that selective retention of particles associated with the C4 fraction or/and preferential mineralization of isotopically light POM could be responsible for these unexpected δ 13 C signatures. This, however, conflicts with the hypothesis proposed by Wynn and  Bird (2007)  that C4 derived or-20 ganic matter decomposes faster than C3-derived material. The reservoir cores show a decrease in organic C with depth, and an increase of δ 13 C with depth, which could be interpreted as resulting from post-depositional mineralisation of OC. However, organic matter mineralization typically induces only a minimal shift in δ 13 C signatures due to fractionation (e.g.,  Kunz et al., 2011) , and hence, the increase of δ 13 C with  25  depth would suggest that C3 material preferentially mineralized over C4. One mechanism could be that C3 material is less protected on minerals of the reservoir sediment, which has very high SA values  (Fig. 8a) . A first-order estimate of post-depositional C losses can be obtained by comparing the %OC data between the upper and lower layers of deepest sediment core. This way, we estimate a ∼ 30 % OC loss thus suggesting a relatively high burial efficiency of organic C (∼ 70 %) in the Masinga reservoir. The burial efficiency of OC in our study is significantly higher compared to ∼ 40 % reported in other temperate and tropical lakes  : Kunz et al., 2011 , but it should be stressed that our estimate is derived from a limited number of data. Nev-5 ertheless, even this coarse estimate underscores the significant role reservoirs play as sinks in global C cycle  (Cole et al., 2007; Battin et al., 2008; Tranvik et al., 2009 ). The surface area (SA) for suspended matter along lower main Tana (60-80 m 2 g −1 ) were within the same range as those reported by  Bouillon et al. (2009)  but are much higher than those reported for coastal sediments, estuaries and rivers (< 50 m 2 g −1 )  (Mayer, 10 1994; Keil et al., 1997; Aufdenkampe et al., 2007) . Compared to the TSM, the riverine sediment showed a much larger range in SA, due to the sandy and muddy deposits in the river bed. As expected,  (Mayer, 1994; Keil et al., 1997) , riverine sediment %OC showed a positive correlation with SA  (Fig. 8b) , a strong indication of protective organic matter adsorption to mineral surface areas. For coarser, sandy sediments (low SA val-15 ues), %OC were generally higher than expected for the ""monolayer equivalent""  (Mayer, 1994) , whereas the opposite was true for more clay-rich riverine sediments (higher SA). This would be consistent with a significant fraction of non-bound particulate matter in coarser sediments, while most of the particulate C in fine-grained sediments is more strongly bound to clay minerals. In contrast, soil %OC did not show significant 20 relationship with corresponding SA  (Fig. 8b) , and the majority of soil samples had %OC values above the monolayer equivalence lines, which is consistent with a contribution from non-bound plant-derived organic matter. The OC : SA ratios for riverine sediments were consistently lower than those of soils with similar SA values, suggesting that riverine OC particles have been subjected to extensive degradation losses. All reservoir  25  sediments and suspended matter samples showed high SA values of > 60 m 2 g −1 , and organic C loadings were always below the monolayer equivalent zone. The observed range of OC : SA values in these suspended matter and reservoir sediment samples (0.14-0.53 and 0.16-0.25 mg OC m −2 , respectively) are markedly lower than the range previously observed in other large river systems such as the Amazon, Fly, Columbia, and Hung He (typically between 0.25 and 1; see  Keil et al., 1997) , and fall more in the range of values found in coastal or marine sediments  (Aufdenkampe et al., 2007) . These low OC : SA values thus suggest a very stable organic C pool which has undergone extensive degradation of the more labile fractions during erosional and riverine 5 transport and retention cycles. The relationship between %POC and TSM followed an inverse relationship as reported for other world rivers  (Meybeck, 1982) . Two different hypotheses have been proposed to explain this relationship  (Thurman, 1985 , Ludwig et al., 1996 . First, decreasing %POC in suspended matter with increasing TSM concentrations could reflect the variable contribution of the autochthonous C pro-10 duced by riverine phytoplankton. Secondly, this pattern may reflect mixing between more organic-rich surface soil runoff and/or direct litter contributions, and deeper soilderived sediments with reduced organic C loading. In our study, the high POC : Chl-a ratios  (Fig. 4b ) strongly favour the second hypothesis. Only for the reservoirs (Kamburu and Masinga) do our data suggest that the elevated %POC is explained by in-15 situ phytoplankton production. The elevated %POC recorded in headwater tributaries is majorly derived from allochthonous fresh plant materials, while low %POC values recorded in lower main Tana particularly during the wet season are due to dilution by soil mineral particles (from mechanical erosion associated with surface runoff during flash floods during the wet season and bank instability during dry season). During wet 20 season sampling, high amount of terrigeneous and lithological materials originating from soil and/or bank erosion, characterized by low organic C content is a dominant characteristic. The %POC relationship from our data fits well with an empirical model based on  Ludwig et al. (1996)  data in the lower TSM range (up to ∼ 1000 mg l −1 ), but %OC values are markedly higher than global averages in the higher TSM range  25  (> 1000 mg l −1 ). In addition, %POC was generally higher than soil %OC particularly in higher altitude sites due to additional contributions from the riparian vegetation in form of direct litter inputs rich in organic matter. Higher %POC are also likely due from contributions from eroded soil organic matter and top soil detritus. DOC concentrations in the present study (0.2 to 6.9 mg l −1 ) are relatively low compared to those reported for other African rivers (range 0.6 to 51.2;  Martins, 1983; Seyler et al., 1995; Coynel et al., 2005; Brunet et al., 2009; Spencer et al., 2010)  but consistent with average values for rivers crossing semi-arid climates as reported by  Spitzy and Leenheer (1991) . The altitudinal profiles show contrasting patterns during differ-5 ent seasons: for the dry season, concentrations were consistently low throughout the basin  (Bouillon et al., 2009) , increased gradually downstream during the wet season  (Fig. 5a) , or showed consistently higher values in the high-elevation sites (end of wet season,  Fig. 5a ) in Aberdare and Mt. Kenya headwaters which may be attributed to presence of peatlands and swamps. DOC in high mountain streams are typically much 10 lower than those of other natural waters  (Meybeck, 1982; Hedges et al., 2000) . However, most of these studies were conducted at higher latitudes where organic-rich peat soils do not occur  (Townsend-Small et al., 2005) . The generally higher DOC concentrations during wet and end of wet season would be consistent with a terrestrial-derived origin of DOC, which is also most likely given the minimal contribution of phytoplankton  15  to POC pool. DOC : POC ratios were relatively low and ranged from 0.02 in the lower reaches of Tana River main channel to 5.5 in the headwaters. The global average contribution of DOC to the total riverine OC pool is highly variable, ranging between 10 and 90 %  (Meybeck, 1982)  but recent estimates put global mean DOC contribution at 73±21 %, and 61±30 % for tropical systems  (Alvarez-Cobelas et al., 2010) . In the Tana 20 basin, DOC typically dominated in the tributaries (59 ± 21 %) while POC dominated in the main Tana River (DOC contribution of 34 ± 23 %), which is typical for highly erosive and turbid systems and in line with the general trend of lower DOC : POC ratios with increasing TSM  (Meybeck, 1982; Ittekkot and Laane, 1991; Middelburg and Herman, 2007; Ralison et al., 2008; Bouillon et al., 2009 ). The δ 13 C DOC values gradually in-  25  crease downstream  (Fig. 5b) , but much less pronounced as what is observed for POC  (Fig. 4a)  weak correlation between δ 13 C DOC and δ 13 C POC  (Fig. 6a)  suggests that the exchange of C between POC and DOC pools is limited.

 Links between terrestrial and aquatic carbon pools Soil %OC showed a marked altitudinal gradient, with high values in high altitude sites and consistently decrease to low values in sites along the lower Tana River. This alti-5 tudinal gradient in soil organic C is in accordance with previous and more large-scale datasets on soil organic C stocks in Kenya  (Batjes, 1996 (Batjes, , 2004 , and is also observed in other large-scale studies such as in the Amazon Basin (e.g.,  Townsend-Small et al., 2005; Aufdenkampe et al., 2007) . A similar gradient was observed in riverine sediment %OC  (Fig. 3b ). Such gradients are typically explained by the associated temperature gradient, which leads to less efficient soil organic matter degradation in colder, high-altitude regions  (Couteaux et al., 2002; Finlay and Kendall, 2007) . As expected (e.g.,  Townsend-Small et al., 2005) , both soil and sediment TOC/TN ratios showed an altitudinal gradient, although more pronounced in sediments (R 2 = 0.25 and 0.37, respectively). The stable isotope composition of soil organic matter in principle reflects  15  the isotope signatures of the vegetation. Thus, soil organic matter δ 13 C values of about −27 ‰ and −13 ‰ are expected in areas dominated by C3 and C4 plants, respectively  (Finlay and Kendall, 2007; Kendall et al., 2001) . Although δ 13 C-soil values in the present study do not show systematic patterns with altitude/downstream, the values exhibited the full range of C3 to C4 signatures (−28.5 to −13.2 ‰) consistent  20  with the variable vegetation patterns within the catchment. The distribution of C3 and C4 grasses in Kenya has been documented by  Tieszen et al. (1979)  sites show a clear C4 influence and so is POC and riverine sediments (see above). The δ 13 C-sediment values (−27.8 to −16.2 ‰) show a more narrow range of values with less variability than surface soils considering sediments integrate soil inputs from larger areas and so are more mixed than spot samples in soils. This concurs with  Bird et al. (1994b)  findings from an African tropical system that δ 13 C-sediment values are 5 controlled and/or reflective of the dominant vegetation type present in the river catchment among other factors such as altitude. It should be stressed that estimates of C3 and C4 contributions using soil δ 13 C data refer to C inputs from these 2 vegetation types, and do not necessarily reflect their relative standing biomass, due to potential differences in their relative productivity and degradability of litter.  Gillson et al. (2004) ,  10  for example, demonstrated that soil δ 13 C data in Kenyan mixed C3-C4 savannas significantly underestimated local C3 plant biomass. The relationship between δ 13 C soil values and δ 13 C DOC and δ 13 C POC values for tributaries  (Fig. 6b)  shows that DOC and POC in the aquatic system usually have a stronger C3 contribution than soils in the subcatchments (with the obvious caveat that our soil  15  samples are not necessarily representative of the entire subcatchment). Organic matter in some of the tributaries also appears to be derived from direct litter inputs, given the higher %OC than observed in soils. 
 Conclusions Generally, suspended sediment and POC delivery in  Tana River was highest during   20  high-flow conditions, with the majority of the suspended load being generated in the lower section of the Tana River. We propose that river bank erosion, coupled with sediment pulses from ephemeral streams form the main sources of these high TSM loads. Thus, the cascade of reservoirs on the Tana River at mid-altitude appear to be very efficient traps for suspended material from high-altitude regions, but also result  25  in a disequilibrium in the lower course of the river, with increased sediment mobilisation downstream.

Comparison of %OC and δ 13 C signatures for bank sediments (black symbols) and riverine POC (grey symbols) from the lower Tana River. 25ment was directly collected into sample tubes. An unusually dry period preceded the fieldwork in September-October 2009 and led to historically low water levels in the Masinga reservoir. This enabled easy access to the reservoir bottom. 
 ter (TSM) concentrations recorded during the dry season in 2008 (0.6 to 483 mg l −1 ) showed a similar range as during the end-of-wet-season conditions in 2010 (1 to 471 mg l −1 ), while the range during the wet-season was one order of magnitude larger (2 to 7058 mg l −1 ), with the highest values obtained in the lower main Tana. Paired t-tests confirm that TSM values were similar during dry season and end of wet sea-main Tana, and this pattern is basically replicated in 2010. In the wet season campaign of 2009, TSM concentrations are an order of magnitude higher, and show no trend along the river axis. In the headwater regions, TSM shows strong variability 5 between streams in all campaigns. TSM for Aberdares tributaries were similar during the three campaigns (p > 0.05) and ranged from 0.6 to 224 mg l −1 .

They contain a single-strand linear DNA genome ranging from 4 to 6 kb, ended by inverted terminal repeats (ITRs)  (1) . Only 15 DV species are referenced in GenBank so far (2); they display a large diversity of sequences, structures, and organizations. Such diversity, together with the diversity of their invertebrate hosts, suggests that DVs are largely unknown and ubiquitous in the environment. It is crucial to understand the densovirus diversity and prevalence for both fundamental and applied virology issues. A novel densovirus was detected from sea barley (Hordeum marinum) using a virion-associated nucleic acid (VANA) viral metagenomic approach (3). To complement this genome, we performed Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) (Roche), and the products were cloned in the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega) and sequenced. The sequences were assembled using Geneious 7.1.4 and compared to database sequences using BLASTn, BLASTp, and tBLASTx (4). The results were considered to be indicative of significant homology when BLAST E values were Ͻ10 Ϫ3 . The genome of this novel DV consists of 4,734 nucleotides (nt), with short ITRs of 130 and 77 nucleotides (nt) at the 3= and 5= ends, respectively. The iteravirus genome size is about 5 kb, with ITRs of 250 nt, suggesting that the ITRs of this novel densovirus are not complete  (5) . The genomic organization of this densovirus is monosense, with three predicted intronless open reading frames (ORFs) encoding two nonstructural proteins (NS) and one structural protein (VP). ORF1 (nt 253 to 2505) has a coding capacity of 750 amino acids (aa) and contains the typical nonstructural 1 (NS1) helicase superfamily III. ORF2 (nt 2559 to 4568) encodes a 669-aa protein corresponding to VP, and it contains the characteristic phospholipase A2 motif  (6) . ORF3 (nt 380 to 1729) has a coding capacity for NS2 of 449 aa and typically overlapped NS1. The alignment of the VP and NS protein sequences using Clustal W 1.8.1  (7)  revealed that this genome had the highest identity (84.9%) with Danaus plexippus plexippus densovirus (DpplDV) (GenBank accession no. KF963252)  (8) . This genome was independently purified from leaves of the original plant stored at Ϫ80°C (Qiagen plant DNeasy kit). The PCR products were obtained from different leaves using 15 pairs of primers covering the whole genome that were sequenced using Sanger's method (Cogenics). Recombination analyses using RDP4.18  (9)  revealed that this novel DV might result from an intragenus recombination event between DpplDV and Dendrolimus punctatus densovirus (DpDV). No insect has been found in any part of this plant, no reads obtained from this plant were assigned to arthropods, and no products were obtained using an insect DNA bar coding based on the PCR amplification of a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene  (10) . This densovirus might come from contamination of the plant aerial part by infected arthropods or circulate systemically in planta, as already reported  (11) . This virus was tentatively named H. marinum densovirus (HormaDV). Nucleotide sequence accession number. The GenBank accession no. of HormaDV is KM576800.

Paramyxovirinae has recently been subdivided into seven genera: Aquaparamyxovirus, Avulavirus, Ferlavirus, Henipavirus, Morbillivirus, Respirovirus, and Rubulavirus (http://ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy. asp?version52012). Viruses of this family affect a wide range of animals, including primates, birds, carnivores, ungulates, snakes, cetaceans and humans, and cause a wide variety of infections, such as measles, mumps, pneumonia and encephalitis in humans, and distemper, peste des petits ruminants, Newcastle disease and respiratory tract infections in animals. However, several paramyxoviruses (PVs) have not been classified into any of these seven genera, including Nariva virus (NarPV)  [2] , Mossman virus (MosPV)  [3] , Beilong virus (BeiPV)  [4] , J virus (JPV)  [5, 6] , Tupaia paramyxovirus (TupPV)  [7]  and Tailam virus  [8] , all of which belong to a group of novel paramyxoviruses isolated from wild animals, as well as Salem virus isolated from horses  [9] . Among them, only JPV has been shown to be pathogenic, causing extensive haemorrhagic lesions in rodents  [6] . Horizontal transmission is the principal mode of intraspecies PV infection, suggesting that contaminated faeces, urine or saliva may be responsible for spillover to other species  [10] . Bats have a close evolutionary relationship with several genera of mammalian paramyxoviruses  [11] . Otherwise, bat-borne paramyxoviruses are in close relationship to known paramyxoviruses of mammalian. These small mammals are known to harbour a broad diversity of PVs, including emergent henipaviruses (Nipah virus and Hendra virus) and rubulaviruses [Menangle virus, Tioman virus, Mapuera virus, and Tuhoko virus 1, 2 and 3 (ThkPV-1, ThkPV-2 and ThkPV-3)]. A very broad diversity of paramyxoviruses, including Henipa-, Rubula-, Pneumo-and Morbilli-related viruses, have been detected in six of ten tested bat families  [11] . Whereas most of the viruses identified in bats do not seem to cause clinical disease in these animals, there have been reports of rabid bats  [12, 13]  and of unusually large numbers of animals succumbing to infection by rabies virus  [14] . As part of a large-scale investigation of viral diversity in bats and of associated zoonotic risks, we have previously detected a bat paramyxovirus in one insectivorous African sheath-tailed bat (Coleura afra)  [11] , exhibiting several hemorrhagic lesions at necropsy. We therefore examined occurrence of this bat paraymxovirus in other bats. 
 Materials and Methods 
 Ethics statements The study was conducted in the Belinga mountains (northeast Gabon), where Ebola outbreaks occurred in  1994-1996 and 2001-2002 . All the capture events, animal handling, euthanasia and transfer of samples across country borders were Gabon. There are no patents, products in development, or marketed products to declare. This does not alter the authors' adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed in the online guide for authors. performed in accordance with the guidelines of the American Society of Mammalogists (http://www.mammalsociety.org/committees/animal-care-anduse)  [15] : bats were captured following recommendations by Kunz and Parsons  [16]  and identified by trained field biologist. Captured bats were removed carefully from nets as soon as possible to minimize injury, drowning, strangulation, or stress. Safe and humane euthanasia was achieved through the use of inhalant anaesthetic (halothane) prior to autopsy. All work (capture, euthanasia and autopsy) was carried out with authorization from the Gabonese Ministry of Water and Forestry (Département de la  
 Bat sampling Samples of liver, spleen, kidney, lung, heart, gut, brain and salivary glands were collected, stored in liquid nitrogen and transferred to the CIRMF laboratory (Centre International de Recherches Médicales de Franceville, Gabon), where they were stored at 280˚C until analysis. Blood samples were also collected, except from the smallest individuals (body mass ,12 g). A total of 985 bats  (Table 1)   Interestingly, at autopsy, only one C. afra out of the 26 individuals, from Batouala cave, exhibited diarrhea and severe hemorrhagic lesions in both thoracic and abdominal organs, along with lung congestion and pleurisy. 
 Viral PCR screening Virological screening of the diseased bat was performed to identify the cause of these lesions. The screening process included the whole Paramyxoviridae family and also filoviruses [Marburg virus (MARV) and Zaire Ebola virus (EBOV)], given the nature of the lesions and the known filovirus tropism for bats. Briefly, approximately 100 mg each of this animal's liver and spleen were pooled and crushed in 600 ml of cold PBS in a ball-mill tissue grinder (Genogrinder 2000, Spex Centripep). Total RNA was extracted using a Biorobot EZ1 and the EZ1 RNA tissue mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The RNA was then tested for paramyxoviruses, using three heminested reverse transcription-PCR (hnRT-PCR) assays targeting the polymerase gene  [17] , and also for Marburg virus  [18]  and Zaire Ebola virus  [19] . However, the screening was extended to Arenaviruses, Flaviviruses, Alphaviruses, polyomaviruses, Orthopoxviruses, Parapoxviruses, Influenza viruses, Lyssaviruses and Rhabdoviridae family. 
 Paramyxovirus detection in bat populations To further investigate the presence of the virus in bat populations, a strain-specific real-time RT-PCR assay (primers: GB09-478-F, 59-GGCGGCTCTTAAAAGT-GAATG-39; GB09-478-R, 59-GCGGGGTCAAATTGGTCAT-39; probe: GB09-478-P, 59-TCCAGCACAAACATATCCGAGAAGGCTAG-39) was designed within the initial PCR fragment and was used to test total RNA extracted from mixed liver and spleen samples from each of all the other bat species. The amplification was performed in a final volume of 25 ml, containing, 12.5 ml TaqMan R 2X PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.5 ml each primer and probe (10 mM), 1 ml bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) (Invitrogen), 5 ml cDNA and RNAse-free water (Invitrogen). Amplification generally involved 2 min at 55˚C, 10 min at 95˚C followed by 45 cycles of 15s at 95˚C and 1 min at 58˚C. 
 Virus distribution in organs of infected bats In order to determine the organ distribution of this virus in infected bats, total RNA was extracted from heart, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, intestine and brain samples from all 14 real-time RT-PCR-positive bats, as described previously, and screened, using the same strain-specific real-time RT-PCR assay shown above. 
 Entomological study Transmission by hematophagous arthropods was studied. Hematophagous arthropods were collected inside Faucon and Zadié caves. Mosquitoes were sampled using CDC light traps whereas bat-flies were manually collected on bats (Coleura afra, Miniopterus inflatus, Hipposideros cf. ruber and Rousettus aegyptiacus) trapped in the Faucon and Zadié caves between November and December 2009, June 2010, and January, March and April 2011. After the morphologic species determination, insects were crushed by monospecific pools (up to 10 specimens for mosquitoes, and between 1 and 5 for bat-flies) in 300 ml PBS. Total RNA was extracted using 100 ml of the supernatant from each pool by using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and then was tested with the specific realtime RT-PCR assay described above. 
 Blast and phylogenetic analysis The viral sequences obtained were first compared to those available in the public database using the algorithm ""Blastn"" from BLAST program  [20]  and then aligned with homologous sequences of Paramyxoviridae reference strains from GenBank, using the MEGA program version 5  [21] . Bayesian inference of phylogeny was done using MrBayes V.3.2 software and the GTR+G+I nucleotide substitution model  [22]  for two million generations with a burn-in of 25%. 
 Results 
 Identification and molecular characterization One of three hnRT-PCR, Respiro-, Morbilli-and Henipaviruses PCR (RMH-PCR) assays yielded an amplicon of 559 base pairs (bp) from diseased bat, in collaborative work with the Bonn Institute of Virology Bonn (Germany). The PCR product was sequenced with dye terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems). No other virus was detected in the diseased bat. Blast and phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the sequence from diseased bat, designated BatPV GB09 478 (Genbank accession number HQ660155), belonged to the Paramyxoviridae family. It showed 65% and 66% nucleotide identity, respectively, with JPV and BeiPV, and had pairwise nucleotide identities of 36-42% with the Henipavirus group and 37-40% with the Morbillivirus group. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that this bat PV, that we named Belinga bat virus (BelPV), clustered with unclassified paramyxoviruses and was located between the genera Morbillivirus and Henipavirus  (Fig. 1) . In this study, among all animals tested by the strain-specific real-time RT-PCR assay only 14 C. afra bats, including the diseased animal, were positive. Bat samples positive by specific real-time RT-PCR were then tested with RMH-hemi nested-PCR for molecular characterization. Another 439-bp PCR product was amplified from one liver-spleen pool from a second C. afra specimen, and was sequenced. These two phylogenetically related sequences  (Fig. 1) , designated BatPV GB09 478 and BatPV GB09 450, displayed 100% of nucleotide identity. 
 Prevalence and organ distribution of BelPV in Coleura afra BelPV-specific RNA was detected only in C. afra, with a prevalence of 14.9% (14/ 94 of the C. afra individuals sampled from the Faucon and Batouala caves) (  Table 1) . Interestingly, no bats belonging to the other five species tested positive. BelPV RNA was detected in the heart (8/12) and liver  (5/14) , at low and variable loads (  Table 2  and  Fig. 2 ). No significant difference in the BelPV RNA detection rate was found between the two organs (x 2 52.476, df51, p.0.20). In the bat exhibiting severe hemorrhagic lesions (GB09 478), both the liver and heart were BelPV-positive, with a higher viral load in the heart (Ct value 528). 
 Entomological study In total, 432 arthropods were collected inside Faucon and Zadié caves, including Culicidae (10 Uranotaenia nigromaculata and 320 Culex wigglesworthi), Nycteribiidae (51 Eucampsipoda africana, 26 Nycteribia schmidlii scotti and 21 Penicillidia fulvida) and Streblidea (Brachytarsina allaudi and 1 Raymondia huberi huberi) (  Table 1) . No arthropods tested were positive for Belinga Bat Virus  (Table 1 ). 
 Discussion The BelPV nucleotide sequence obtained showed similarity with the JPV and BeiPV sequences. BelPV has previously been reported to hold a phylogenetic position between the genera Henipavirus and Morbillivirus. The same phylogenetic position had been observed with MosPV and J-V  [4] . In this study, organs with high BelPV concentrations are different from those found with high paramyxovirus concentrations in pteropodids and microchiroptera bats. In microchiroptera bats from Brazil, spleen has been found more positive than the others organs with highest viral load, as in Eidolon helvum (megachiroptera bat) in Africa  [11] . However, in our study majority of spleen were not available. The within-host BelPV distribution tended to be organ-specific. BelPV seemed to be restricted to the heart and liver. In contrast, JPV has been isolated from blood, lung, liver, kidney and spleen of experimentally infected laboratory mice  [6]  but not in heart. The BelPV distribution for the heart and liver, together with the high viral load in heart tissue, could suggest that this virus is likely to be present in the bloodstream and might thus be transmitted during aggressive contacts between bats, or by blood-sucking vectors. Nethertheless, viremia was  not proven. BelPV RNA was not searched from blood because in these small species of bats blood was difficult to collect in the field. We detected BelPV only in Coleura afra and not in other bat species sharing the same roosting sites and living in very close proximity in the two caves sampled. However, it has been shown that bats of different species occupying the same roosting sites can share the same viruses. Marburg virus had been detected in Rousettus aegyptiacus and Hipposideros sp. bats living in Kitaka cave in Uganda  [23]  and Miniopterus inflatus and Rousettus aegyptiacus bats caught in Goroumbwa mine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  [24] . These bat species are known to live in close proximity. Thus, virus transmission between different bat species is possible  [25] . Thus, we can speculate that the failure to detect BelPV in other bat species sharing the same caves would suggest that this virus has strong host specificity for C. afra, as well as restricted intraspecies transmission. Henipaviruses occur naturally in fruit bats belonging to the genus Pteropus  [26] , and this also appears to be true of severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses in Rhinolophus bats  [27, 11] . In view of our data we can assume that BelPV might have pathogenic potential for its host C. afra. Indeed, high viral load was detected in the heart of the diseased bat, and the lesions were consistent with those reported in wild rodents and mice experimentally infected by JPV  [6] . Although BelPV RNA was also detected in asymptomatic bats, pathogenicity may appear in long term under some immunological and/or ecological conditions. Indeed, virus must not induce pathology to persist or adapt within its reservoir host. Many authors suggested that persistence in the absence of pathology or disease appears to be a common characteristic of bat viruses in their natural host population  [28, 29] . However, a severe immunodepression for instance, may increase the risk of infection with opportunistic pathogens. Under some environmental conditions (cool environments for example), some avirulent pathogens, such as Geomyces destructans, causative agent of white-nose syndrome, may become pathogenic in hibernating bats in North America  [30, 31] . Nevertheless, infection by BelPV may be mild for bats and thus the pathology observed not directly related. Otherwise, it may also be that this animal had an underlying disease or infection with a different pathogen. Even in this case, we might not draw any conclusions neither establish a link with lesions seen. Therefore, the pathogenicity of the BelPV should be demonstrated by experimental animal infection. Otherwise, viral antigens or RNAs should be detected histologically in the lesions of naturally-infected bats. However, the unavailability of biological tissues from the diseased bat failed to perform these analyzes. Consequently, other captures of Coleura afra species are considered in order to find BelPV again for further studies (pathogenicity to its host, isolation and complete genome characterization). However, Coleura afra is a migratory species living in colonies of several hundred individuals. In Gabon, this species, which has been recently described, is not present all year round in the caves of the north-east of the country, making the studies on this species difficult and thereof partly explaining the lack of virological studies. Some viruses appear to cause clinical disease in wild-living bats; these include lyssaviruses and an ebola-like filovirus named Lloviu virus  [32, 33, 34] . Bats are the natural reservoirs for many viruses, including emerging zoonotic viruses such as SARS-CoV  [27] , Hendra and Nipah viruses  [26, 35] , Ebola virus  [36] , Marburg virus  [23, 37] , rabies virus and other Lyssaviruses  [11] . In general, humans are infected through an intermediate amplifying host such as palm civets for SARS-CoV, horses for Hendra virus and pigs for Nipah virus  [38] . However, in humans Nipah virus outbreaks linked to bats exposure have been reported  [39] . It remains to be shown whether the BelPV reported here presents a zoonotic risk. Nonetheless, like most RNA viruses, for example coronaviruses, characterized by high mutation and/or recombination rates  [40] , PVs may adapt to novel hosts, including humans. A serological test capable of detecting antibodies to this virus in human populations living in the vicinity of these animals is needed to assess zoonotic potential. All the blood-sucking arthropods collected from bats, as well as mosquitoes collected in the caves where bat sampling took place, were negative for BelPV, in keeping with the lack of known PV vectors  [41] . However, BelPV transmission by blood-sucking vectors within the Gabonese population of C. afra cannot be ruled out. Indeed, a haemosporidian parasite (Polychromophilus) was found in a blood parasite vector (Penicillidia fulvida) in Faucon cave in Gabon in 1977  [42]  and also in its host M. inflatus (greater long-fingered bat) from the same cave in 2010 and 2011  [43] . In addition, the methodology used to collect flying hematophagous insects (based on light traps) possibly introduced a bias by selecting only those attracted by light. Therefore, we can not exclude that additional sampling techniques could increase the number of mosquitoes species or groups known to colonize caves such as sandflies or biting midges. Hence, the natural mode of transmission of this unclassified paramyxovirus in bat populations, through batbat aggression for example, remains to be determined. This association between C. afra and BelPV could serve as an interesting model, (i) to evaluate modes of transmission within host populations, (ii) to study hostvirus interactions (pathogenesis and host specificity), and (iii) to evaluate the zoonotic risk of a newly identified virus. Further studies of C. afra populations and a broader diversity of arthropod vectors, spanning larger areas and time scales, are needed to confirm this apparent host-virus specificity, and to determine the modes of BelPV transmission. Further studies are needed to characterize complete BelPV genome and demonstrate the pathogenicity of this virus for its host Coleura afra.

Theileriosis, heartwater, babesiosis and anaplasmosis are considered the most important tick-borne diseases of livestock in sub-Saharan Africa, resulting in extensive economic losses to livestock farmers in endemic areas. Information on the distribution of tick-borne diseases and ticks is scarce in Northern Botswana. Nevertheless, this data is necessary for targeting surveillance and control measures in livestock production at national level. Methods In order to address this gap, we analyzed 120 blood samples from buffalo herds for the presence of common tick-borne haemoparasites causing disease in livestock, collected in two of the main wildlife areas of Northern Botswana: the Chobe National Park (CNP, n?=?64) and the Okavango Delta (OD, n?=?56). Results Analysis of the reverse line blot (RLB) hybridization assay results revealed the presence of Theileria, Babesia, Anaplasma and Ehrlichia species, either as single or mixed infections. Among the Theileria spp. present, T. parva (60%) and T. mutans (37%) were the most prevalent. Other species of interest were Anaplasma marginale subsp. centrale (30%), A. marginale (20%), Babesia occultans (23%) and Ehrlichia ruminantium (6%). The indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) indicated 74% of samples to be positive for the presence of T. parva antibodies. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) detected the highest level of animals infected with T. parva (81% of the samples). The level of agreement between the tests for detection of T. parva positive animals was higher between qPCR and IFAT (kappa?=?0.56), than between qPCR and RLB (kappa?=?0.26) or the latter and IFAT (kappa?=?0.15). Conclusions This is the first report of tick-borne haemoparasites in African buffalo from northern Botswana, where animals from the CNP showed higher levels of infection than those from OD. Considering the absence of fences separating wildlife and livestock in the CNP and the higher levels of some parasite species in buffalo from that area, surveillance of tick-borne diseases in livestock at the interface in the CNP should be prioritized.

Tick-borne haemoparasites in African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) from two wildlife areas in Northern Botswana. Parasites and Vectors, 8 (26) : 11 p..  http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-014-0627-y",22,20150123,Tick-borne haemoparasites in African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) from two wildlife areas in Northern Botswana,,"Background Theileriosis, babesiosis, anaplasmosis and heartwater are considered to be the most important tick-borne diseases (TBDs) of livestock in sub-Saharan Africa, resulting in extensive economic losses to farmers in endemic areas. The African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) is the natural reservoir host of Theileria parva, which is transmitted by the tick species, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, R. zambeziensis and R. duttoni  [1, 2] . T. parva causes East Coast fever (ECF), which occurs in eastern and central Africa. ECF was introduced into southern Africa in the early 1900s through cattle importation from East Africa and was eradicated from South Africa in the 1950s  [3, 4] . T. parva also causes Corridor Disease, which is still prevalent in South Africa in areas where buffalo and cattle share grazing grounds in the presence of its tick vectors. It is a controlled disease in South Africa because of a concern that ECF might recur  [5, 6] . Although T. parva distributions have been described in Mozambique  [7] , Zambia  [8]  and Zimbabwe  [3] , no information on the distribution of T. parva is available for many other southern African countries, including Botswana. In addition to T. parva, buffalo are also thought to be the original reservoir host of other non-pathogenic, mildly pathogenic and benign Theileria species namely, Theileria mutans, Theileria velifera, Theileria buffeli, Theileria sp. (buffalo)  [9, 10]  and Theileria sp. (bougasvlei)  [11, 12] . Theileria parasites usually occur as mixed infections in buffalo and cattle. Although the benign and nonpathogenic forms do not have any significant economic importance, their presence could interfere with the interpretation of results obtained in some diagnostic tests designed to diagnose the pathogenic T. parva. Diagnostic tests for T. parva include microscopic examination of blood smears for the presence of piroplasms and schizonts, and serological methods such as the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) which is routinely used in South Africa for T. parva antibody detection in ""disease free"" buffalo  [13, 14] . Molecular diagnostic methods detect specific parasite sequences in DNA extracts from blood or tissue samples. The reverse line blot (RLB) hybridization assay makes use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of haemoparasite small subunit ribosomal RNA genes (srRNA) which are screened with group-and species-specific probes for the simultaneous detection and identification of haemoparasites in mixed infections  [15] . To date, the most sensitive molecular test for the detection of T. parva is a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) using hybridization probe chemistry, where the central region of the parasite 18S rRNA gene is amplified and the presence of T. parva is confirmed by melting curve analysis  [16] . It is currently routinely used to test for T. parva infections in buffalo and cattle in South Africa as part of the Corridor disease control strategy. It has been shown that African buffalo are also carriers of a number of other tick-borne parasites which are detrimental to livestock including Ehrlichia ruminantium, Babesia bigemina, B. bovis, Anaplasma marginale and A. marginale subsp. centrale  [17] [18] [19] . Although buffalo show no disease symptoms, as reservoir hosts, they may represent a threat to the livestock industry. Ehrlichia ruminantium, an intracellular rickettsial bacterium, is the causative agent of heartwater (cowdriosis) and is transmitted by three-host ticks belonging to the genus, Amblyomma  [20] . Babesia bigemina and B. bovis cause bovine babesiosis, commonly known as redwater fever. Tick vectors for these parasites include Rhipicephalus microplus (formerly Boophilus microplus) and Rhipicephalus annulatus (formerly Boophilus annulatus). It is believed that Babesia is the second most common blood parasite after trypanosomes representing a significant health risk for cattle  [21] . Anaplasma marginale causes bovine anaplasmosis which is characterized by the infiltration of the host's red blood cells. It can be transmitted to other hosts through mechanical transmission but the most important mode of transmission is via tick bites, the main tick vector being R. decoloratus (formerly Boophilus decoloratus)  [22, 23] . Anaplasma marginale subsp. centrale causes a milder form of anaplasmosis, and is used in a live blood vaccine in many countries, including South Africa  [24] . Generally speaking, publications on significant tickborne haemoparasites in Botswana are limited  [25] [26] [27] [28]  and there are no published reports of the presence of T. parva in livestock in this country. In addition, published literature on the occurrence of pathogens in buffalo populations from Botswana is very scarce  [29] . Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of tick-borne parasites circulating in two distinct buffalo populations from Northern Botswana using different diagnostic methods and to use these data to compare the performance of those tests in detecting T. parva in buffalo. 
 Methods 
 Buffalo sampling The Chobe National Park (CNP) and Okavango Delta (OD) are located in two different districts of Northern Botswana (Chobe and Ngamiland Districts, respectively) and represent the largest wildlife areas in this part of the country. They are both integrated in the Foot and Mouth Disease infected area, a large part of the northern region of Botswana devoted to wildlife conservation in which buffalo populations are separated from the primary cattle export and buffer zones by the use of veterinary cordon fences (  Figure 1 ). The Chobe, Zambezi and Okavango rivers are the largest in the region, providing abundant water throughout the year. Rainfall is strongly seasonal, occurring mostly from December to April (wet season). Vegetation consists mainly of deciduous dry woodland and scattered grasslands. Wildlife abundance is fundamentally dependent on rainfall and water availability and varies cyclically throughout the years  [30] . The CNP encompasses 10 700 km 2 of savannah grassland. The boundaries of CNP are natural, the Chobe river in the north constituting the natural border between Botswana and Namibia. There is no physical barrier preventing contacts between cattle and wildlife and the main water source for the animals in that area is the Chobe river which is exposed to seasonal variations of water levels. The OD encompasses 16 000 km 2 and contrary to the CNP, it is delineated from livestock areas by a double veterinary cordon fence to prevent contacts between wildlife and cattle  [29] , and it is largely flooded throughout the year. According to the last available wildlife census from Northern Botswana, buffalo populations and densities are estimated at 31 500 individuals and 0.94 individuals/km 2 in OD and 7 500 individuals and 0.23 individuals/km 2 in the CNP  [31] . The sampling process was opportunistic and details of the capture approach were described  [29] . During the capture process, blood samples were collected from a total of 120 individual buffalo. In the CNP, buffalo were captured along the Chobe river and blood samples were collected from 64 individual buffalo belonging to seven distinct herds. In the OD, 8 buffalo herds were sampled in two different management units: the Moremi Game Reserve (MGR) (n = 18 individuals, 4 herds) and in the NG30 area (n = 38 individuals, 4 herds) (  Figure 1 ). Buffalo densities in those locations were estimated at 1.88 buffalo/km 2 for the Chobe river, 1.37 buffalo/km 2 for the MGR and 3.55 buffalo/km 2 for the NG30 area of the OD (31). The sex and age of the animals were recorded. Age was measured according to dentition; animals younger than 3 years were considered as young and animals older than 3 years were considered to be adults. Whole blood samples were obtained from the jugular vein, maintained in refrigeration and sent to the Botswana National Veterinary Laboratory in Gaborone. There, they were centrifuged at 1500 xg for 15 minutes. Sera was then harvested with a pipette and stored frozen at −20°C, until the samples were ready to be sent to the Agricultural Research Council-Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute (ARC-OVI) in South Africa for analysis. 
 Blood smears and DNA extraction A total of 120 thin layer smears were prepared in the field from a blood drop of the ear sublime vein of the captured buffalo (two individuals were missed). Those were dried in the sun and fixed with methanol. At the laboratory, each smear was stained with Giemsa dye following the standard procedures. Genomic DNA was extracted from the Giemsa-stained slides using the QIAmp DNA mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. The DNA was eluted into 100 μl of TE buffer and stored at −20°C until further use. 
 PCR amplification and reverse line blot (RLB) hybridization assay A total of 120 DNA samples were tested using the RLB hybridization assay as previously described  [15, 7] . Briefly, the V4 hypervariable region of the parasite 18S rRNA gene was amplified using primers RLB-F2 and RLB-R2  [32] , while the V1 region of the parasite 16S rRNA gene was amplified from Ehrlichia and Anaplasma species using primers Ehr-F and Ehr-R  [33] . The PCR reaction was prepared as follows: 5 μl DNA (30-50 ng), 12.5 μl Platinum Quantitative PCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen, The Scientific Group, South Africa), and 20 pmol of each primer made up to a total volume of 25 μl using nuclease-free water. Amplification was done using a touchdown PCR programme as previously described  [32] . A T. parva positive buffalo DNA sample, 102  [16] , and nuclease-free water were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Amplicons were visualised on a 2% ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel and then screened by the RLB hybridization assay as previously described  [15, 34] . The Theileria, Ehrlichia, Anaplasma and Babesia group-and species-specific oligonucleotide probes used were the same as those described in  [35]  and  [36] . 
 Indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) After discarding haemolysed samples, only a total of 108 serum samples collected from buffalo were available to be tested using the IFAT  [13, 37, 38]  according to OIE standards  [39] . The test was conducted at the ARC-OVI using two dilutions, 1/40 and 1/80. The presence of fluorescence in both the 1/40 and 1/80 dilutions was considered as a positive result in serum from buffalo, indicative of the presence of T. parva antibodies (Olivier Matthee, personal communication). 
 T. parva-specific quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) Among the 120 smears collected, one sample was discarded because of an insufficient amount of DNA for the test. A total of 119 DNA samples were subjected to the T. parva-specific qPCR assay as previously described  [16] . Briefly, the T. parva-specific forward and Theileria genus-specific reverse primers  [16]  were used to amplify a 167 bp fragment of the parasite V4 variable region of the 18S rRNA gene. For the specific detection of T. parva amplicons, the hybridization probes T. parva anchor and T. parva sensor (640 nm LC Red) were included in the PCR reaction which consisted of 4 μl of 10× LightCycler-FastStart DNA Master PLUS Hybridization Probes mix (with 2× final concentration), 0.5 mM of each primer, 0.1 mM of each hybridization probe, 0.5 U Uracil-deoxy-glycosylase (UDG) and 4 μl of the template DNA (30-50 ng) with a final volume of 20 μl. A T. parva positive buffalo DNA sample, 102  [16] , and nuclease-free water were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Amplification and melting curve analysis were done as previously described  [16]  in a LightCycler1 v2 (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Fluorescence values were measured at 640 nm. 
 Statistical analysis Descriptive epidemiological measures were analyzed using Epi-Info software (CDC, Atlanta, USA) and were reported as percentages of positive animals to the different diagnostic tests. Chi square test calculations for homogeneity of two populations (Fischer exact test) were used to statistically evaluate the potential influence of age, sex, location and density of buffalo at the capture sites on the observed parasite prevalence. When the variance of the two groups was not homogenous, the Kruskall Wallis test was used. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Agreement between the different diagnostic tests assessing the presence of T. parva or its antibodies (IFAT, qPCR and RLB) was calculated for those sera having a common result to those tests. Two by two comparisons of the results were expressed using the kappa value. Kappa is a widely used measure of test agreement defined as the quotient of the observed proportion of agreement beyond chance and the maximal proportion of agreement beyond chance  [40] . A kappa of 0 indicates no agreement beyond chance, while a kappa of 1 indicates perfect agreement. A kappa of 0.5 indicates a moderate level of agreement. 
 Ethical statement The study (Project nr. V082-12) was approved by the University of Pretoria Animal Ethics committee. 
 Results 
 RLB The RLB results  (Table 1)  indicated the presence of Theileria, Babesia, Anaplasma and Ehrlichia species, either as single or as mixed infections in the buffalo populations from two wildlife areas assessed in northern Botswana. From a total of 120 blood smear samples tested, 23 samples (19.2%) contained single infections while 80 (66.7%) contained mixed infections. The most prevalent haemoparasite in the CNP was T. mutans (60.9%) followed by T. parva (51.6%), T. buffeli (46.9%), B. occultans (40.6%) and A. marginale subsp. centrale (31.3%). In the OD, T. parva (69.6%) was most prevalent followed by A. marginale subsp. centrale (28.6%) and Theileria sp. (buffalo) (23.2%). RLB results indicated that a total of 72 of the 120 samples (60.0%) tested positive for T. parva DNA. There was a significant difference (p = 0.042) in the prevalence of T. parva-positive samples between the two wildlife areas. However, there was no significant association between prevalence of T. parva, and sex or age of the sampled animals  (Table 2) . RLB results also showed significant differences in the prevalence of T. mutans, T. buffeli, B. occultans, Theileria sp. (sable) and T. velifera infections per wildlife area  (Table 3 ). There was a significant difference (p ≤ 0.05) between the age of animals that harboured A. marginale subsp. centrale, T. buffeli, B. occultans and A. marginale infections  (Table 3 ). There was a significant association (p ≤ 0.05) between sex and the buffalo that tested positive for A. marginale subsp. centrale and T. velifera DNA  (Table 3) . When comparing the T. parva RLB results in the three buffalo capture sites, T. parva prevalence was highest in the NG30 samples (76.3%) followed by the MGR (55.6%) samples and the CNP samples (51.6%). Differences in T. parva prevalence as determined by RLB were only significant when comparing NG30 versus CNP (p = 0.01)  (Figure 2 ). There were no significant differences between the prevalence of other haemoparasites in the different capture sites or the numbers were too small to assess statistical differences IFAT T. parva antibodies were detected in 80 of the 108 (74.1%) samples tested (  Table 2) . Of these, 40 (37.0%) samples tested positive at 1/80 and 40 (37.0%) at 1/40. More buffalo from OD (85.4%) than from CNP (65.0%) were seropositive for T. parva  (Table 2 ) and this difference was significant (p = 0.016). There was no significant difference between the age and sex of the animals that   were seropositive (  Table 2 ). Mean seroprevalence was higher (96.9%) in the NG30 region than in the other two capture sites, 65.0% in the CNP and 60.0% in the MGR and those differences were highly significant. Differences in T. parva seroprevalence between MGR and CNP were not significant (  Figure 2 ). 
 Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) Melting curve analysis (  Figure 3 ) confirmed the presence of T. parva DNA in 96 of 119 (80.7%) samples tested. There were no significant differences between prevalence of T. parva with this test, and the wildlife area, age or sex of the animals (  Table 2 ), but some significant differences were found when comparing capture sites. Mean prevalence of T. parva as determined by qPCR was higher in the NG30 region (94.7%) than in the other two capture sites; 77.8% in the CNP and 61.1% in the MGR, respectively (  Figure 2 ). The differences in T. parva prevalence between MGR and the CNP were not significant but it became highly significant when comparing T. parva prevalence in NG30 with that in the other two areas. 
 Comparison of tests For IFAT, 80/108 (74.1%) samples tested positive for T. parva antibodies, while for the qPCR and the RLB hybridization assay, 96/119 (80.7%) and 72/120 (60.0%) of the samples tested positive, respectively. The Kappa value when comparing IFAT and qPCR indicated a moderate level of agreement (0.561), while the comparison  with RLB and the two other tests indicated a low level of agreement  (Table 4 ). The observed prevalences of T. parva (RLB assay) and T. parva antibodies (IFAT) were both significantly higher in the OD than in CNP, while no significant difference was observed for the qPCR test. 
 Discussion This is the first report on the presence of tick-borne haemoparasites in African buffalo from two of the most representative wildlife areas from northern Botswana. Our results provide new insights on the distribution of haemoparasites from buffalo transmissible to cattle across the two main wildlife areas in northern Botswana which can be inferred to the distribution of their specific vectors. Several important pathogenic haemoparasites which could present a constraint to the livestock industry in Botswana were identified. These included T. parva, A. marginale, B. bovis and E. ruminantium. A higher level of mixed infections was found in CNP compared to the locations sampled in the OD. This may be due to the fact that the Chobe river is the main source of water in the CNP and a high number of buffalo herds congregate along this water source during the dry season which might facilitate the exchange of ticks and their parasites between different individuals. In the OD, there is water all year round and despite some animal densities might be locally higher, buffalo herds might have less interactions between each other. The RLB, IFAT and qPCR tests all indicated a high prevalence of T. parva presence or exposure in both CNP and OD. This indicates a high risk of spreading Corridor disease caused by T. parva from buffalo to cattle by the vector ticks at the livestock-wildlife interface. Other haemoparasites with high prevalence identified by the RLB included T. mutans, T. buffeli, B. occultans and Theileria sp. (sable) in CNP and A. marginale subsp. centrale, Theileria sp. (buffalo) and A. marginale in OD. Generally speaking, the buffalo population in the OD sample had lower levels of haemoparasite infections than the one in the CNP sample, with the exception of Theileria sp. (buffalo) and to a lesser extent Anaplasma sp. Omatjenne and B. bovis (in the two later cases, with very few positives were detected). In the specific case of T. parva, a significant association was observed between densities of buffalo in the capture location of the herds (only 3 measures of density were available) and prevalence found with the different tests, particularly in the case of the IFAT and qPCR results. This was more evident when comparing those areas where differences between density figures were more extreme (cf MGR and the NG30). However, buffalo density is only one possible cause of those differences, and many other habitat variations or ecological factors affecting host health or vector distribution and density in the different range areas where the buffalo herds were sampled, could also be responsible for those differences  [41, 42] . Therefore, further studies with a higher number of data and measures at the different herd locations would be necessary to detect explanatory factors accounting for those prevalence differences. T. parva antibodies were detected in 74.1% of samples tested using the IFAT. Limitations of the IFAT include standardization of the test in buffalo samples, subjectivity towards the interpretation of results acquired and the difficulty of detecting low levels of parasite antibodies  [9, 43] . The IFAT is highly sensitive when testing for antibodies for only one species of Theileria, but in areas where different species overlap; cross-reactions between Theileria species are common (especially between T. parva, T. annulata and T. taurotragi) and reduce the specificity of the test  [9, 40] . However, the geographical distribution of T. annulata and T. parva does not overlap  [44]  and T. taurotragi was not identified in the Botswana buffalo samples. Therefore, the likelihood of cross-reactivity can be ruled out and our results most likely reflect the real presence and burden of T. parva, which would explain the high level of agreement between IFAT and qPCR. Another factor to take into account is the period elapsed from infection and the development of antibodies. With the use of schizont antigen, T. parva antibodies can first be detected 10 to 14 days post-infection and with piroplasm antigens 15 to 21 days post-infection. High levels of antibodies are still detectable 30 to 60 days after the animals have recovered from a T. parva infection which is followed by the gradual decrease of antibody levels. Antibodies can still be detected 4 to 6 months post-recovery and may persist for up to a year at such low levels that they may not be detected at a serum dilution of 1/40  [39] . The animals in our study may have carried T. parva infections for a very long time as suggested by the very low antibody levels observed. Comparing the efficiency of the different tests, we found that the qPCR (80.7%) and IFAT (74.1%) were far better in identifying T. parva positive samples than the RLB assay (60.0%). Although there was correlation between the qPCR and RLB results in the detection of T. parva, minor differences between the results were observed; most notably in those samples with mixed haemoparasite infection. The qPCR assay can reliably detect T. parva in carrier animals with a piroplasm parasitaemia as   [16] . The sensitivity of the RLB assay was determined at 10 −6 % parasitaemia, by testing serial dilutions of T. annulata-infected blood samples  [15] . However, due to the likely presence of multiple parasites present in one sample, competition for available primers may occur in the PCR which in turn would lead to an underrepresentation of some of the parasites detected by RLB alone. Furthermore, weak hybridization and/or crossreactivity of probes may cause the RLB hybridization assay to yield less sensitive results than the qPCR and IFAT  [45] . In addition, mixed infections could mask the presence of novel genotypes in the RLB assay and other tests would be needed to identify them  [46, 47, 15] . Risk factors influencing the prevalence of tick-borne parasites may include the distribution of tick vectors, the abundance of buffalo and cattle and their movement/migratory patterns, resistance of the hosts to the parasites and their tick vectors  [48]  and age of the host  [42] . It has previously been found that older animals have a higher tick load than younger ones  [42] . However, higher tick loads do not necessarily mean higher infection rates of haemoparasites. A model designed in East-Africa also determined that in wildlife-livestock interfaces where only cattle were treated with acaricides, T. parva remained a problem because this treatment had no effect on the disease transmission in buffalo. In addition, the continuous use of acaricides can have significant economic and ecological consequences  [49] . Our study only identified a significant difference between age and infection rate for B. occultans and Theileria sp. (sable), which depending on the species of parasite, were higher in young (A. marginale, A. marginale subsp. centrale,) or in adult animals (B. occultans and Theileria buffeli). However, our sample was too small to be able to detect a consistent trend between age and infestation. A number of studies have previously been conducted on buffalo in South Africa. In the Marakele National Park (MNP) and Kruger National Park (KNP) buffalo were tested for the presence of Theileria spp. using the RLB hybridization assay and the T. parva-specific qPCR assay  [50] . The RLB results indicated the presence of T. parva, Theileria sp. (buffalo), T. mutans, T. buffeli and T. velifera in both parks. The qPCR assay identified 70% of samples positive for T. parva and the RLB results indicated 40% of samples in both parks. In a separate study in the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park and the Greater Limpopo Transfrontier Park, T. parva, Theileria sp. (buffalo), T. mutans, T. buffeli and T. velifera were also identified in African buffalo  [7] . In both studies, the T. parva-specific qPCR was found to be more sensitive than the RLB, correlating with the results found in our study. In another study done in the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park and Kruger National Park, Debiela  [51]  found the same Theileria spp. as in our study in Botswana, as well as A. marginale subsp. centrale, A. marginale, Anaplasma sp. Omatjenne, E. ruminantium and B. occultans. In East Africa, in a study done in four different national parks in Uganda, buffalo were found to be carriers of T. parva, T. mutans, T. velifera, A. marginale and A. marginale subsp. centrale  [52] . In two of these parks, buffalo also carried T. buffeli and Theileria sp. (buffalo). None of the animals sampled were carriers of T. taurotragi, B. bovis, B. bigemina, A. bovis or E. ruminantium. As in Uganda, the pathogenic B. bovis has previously been reported to be absent from buffalo in Botswana  [53] . However, in the current study, we identified the parasite to be present in a low percentage of the OD buffalo tested. Similarly, E. ruminantium could be identified in a few CNP and OD buffalo tested. The significance of buffalo as possible reservoir host of some of these economically important haemoparasites (i.e. A. marginale, E. ruminantium) remains unknown. Theileria sp. (sable), which is fatal to sable (Hippotragus niger) and roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus), but non-pathogenic to buffalo  [34]  was identified in some of the Botswana buffalo. However, it should be noted that the positive RLB signals might be due to cross reactions of the Theileria sp. (sable) probe with genotypes similar to Theileria sp. (sable) and/or with T. velifera and should be interpreted with caution  [12] . Similarly, four samples tested positive for T. ovis which is usually found in goats and sheep. We can only speculate whether these are true findings due to incidental infections, or whether they are as a result of cross-reaction of the RLB probes with previously unknown targets or contamination with other target DNA. The following important tick vectors have been identified in Botswana in previous studies: Amblyomma variegatum, Rhipicephalus decoloratus, R. zambeziensis, R. evertsi evertsi, R. simus, Hyalomma truncatum and H. marginatum rufipes  [54] [55] [56] . These ticks are known to transmit most of the haemoparasites found in this study. These vectors may also be responsible for the transmission of T. buffeli and Theileria sp. (buffalo) but further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis, since the tick vectors of these parasite species remain unknown. T. parva is known to occur in Zambia  [8]  and South Africa  [57, 58] , but this is the first written report of its occurrence in northern Botswana, despite its presence has been suspected for several years. Currently, there are no regulations instituted for the systematic surveillance and control of tick-borne diseases in Botswana. In addition, Corridor Disease in cattle is fulminant and makes it difficult to detect clinical cases in live animals. Therefore, the present work emphasizes the role of the African buffalo, as a sentinel species to identify the presence and circulation of livestock pathogens. The presence of Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and East Coast fever in northern Botswana has been predicted in spatial risk models by some authors  [59] . When infected buffalo share the same home ranges with cattle and other domestic animals, those haemoparasites can be transmitted to cattle through infected tick bites. This information on the circulation of TBD can contribute to raise awareness among veterinary officials and rural communities living at the wildlife-livestock interface so that control measures (prevention of wildlife-cattle contacts, regular dipping) can be implemented to mitigate their economic impact. In a recent comparative assessment of cattle herds in three different wildlife/livestock interfaces in Zimbabwe, significantly higher levels of T. parva antibodies were found in those areas that were unfenced when compared with those that had a physical separation between wildlife and livestock  [60] . Therefore, we can hypothesize that this parasite is less likely to be transmitted from buffalo to cattle in the OD, due to the presence of a veterinary cordon fence preventing contacts with cattle and surrounding the game reserve. To the contrary in the CNP, where there is no physical separation between buffalo and cattle, transmission of common diseases from buffalo to cattle is likely to occur more frequently  [29]  and future surveillance efforts should be targeted in priority towards livestock from this area. 
 Conclusions This paper illustrates the diversity of haemoparasites present in African buffalo from northern Botswana and highlights the role of African buffalo as a sentinel species for livestock tick-borne pathogens. Our results indicate the significance of the African buffalo as reservoir host for important tick-borne haemoparasites that can cause severe disease in cattle. They also suggest that qPCR and IFAT are more efficient in detecting T. parva exposed buffalo than the RLB test. These results should contribute to raise awareness among veterinary authorities regarding the potential occurrence of these parasites in cattle so that appropriate control and surveillance protocols taking into account the presence of infected wildlife reservoirs in those areas can be designed at the wildlife-livestock interface.

The production of cabbage is however, constrained by various insect pests among them Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) the diamondback moth (DBM). This pest can cause severe crop damages  (Talekar and Shelton, 1993) . Although it is difficult to estimate losses at small scale farming in Africa *Corresponding author. E-mail: karamoko.diarra@ucad.edu.sn   (Kibata, 1996) ,  Krishnamoorthy (2004)  reported a 52% yield loss on cabbage which is beyond the economical thresholds. The cost of pest control is estimated to cost US $ 1 billion each year. Synthetic chemical pesticides are the main tools of pest management  (Grzywacz et al., 2010) . Due to their adverse effects on the environment and human health, the use of chemical pesticides is being superseded by biological control agents  (Verkerk and Wright, 1996; Wright, 2002; Sow et al., 2013a) . In addition to that, synthetic chemical pesticides induce resistance among diamondback population  (Eigenbrode and Shelton, 1990) . Their use is no longer economical in cabbage production. On the other hand, DBM counts several natural enemies including parasitoids, predators and microorganisms  (Rowell et al., 2005) . Among the microorganisms, Bacillus thuringiensis was found to be very promising in the control of lepidopteran pests  (González-Cabrera et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2010) . Plant-derived pesticides such as Neem are also considered in Integrated Pest management (IPM) programs for the control of cabbage pests  (Liang et al., 2003; Sarfraz et al., 2005; Charleston et al., 2006) . However, reports showed that intensive use of B. thuringiensis can induce resistance in diamondback populations  (Tabashnik et al., 1994; Meyer et al., 2001) . Furthermore, the use of B. thuringiensis for the control of DBM can also affect beneficials particularly the complex of natural enemies  (Monnerat et al., 2000) . The alternation of Neem and B. thuringiensis is therefore expected to be a promising method for the control of DBM in cabbage  (Prasad et al., 2007; Roh et al., 2007) . However, agronomical benefit of the use of such technique has not been well studied. Previous experiences have shown that most farmers adopt technologies after being exposed to concrete results of such an innovation. The objective of this paper was to compare the effect of alternated treatments of B. thuringiensis and Neem on cabbage pest infestation especially DBM and its repercussions on the agronomical quality of cabbage yield in Senegal. 
 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 Study site The study was conducted in Malika a district in the Niayes in Dakar, Senegal; 12°54'44"" N and 12°08'08"" NW, 189 m above sea level (  Figure 1 ). The area is characterized by long dry seasons from November to June with temperatures range of 15 to 20°C and short rainy seasons from July to October with temperatures ranging between 25 and 35°C. Yearly precipitations do not exceed 500 mm between August and September. 
 Cabbage crops Cabbage Brassica oleracea var. ""Marché de Copenhague"" which, is drought tolerant was used in this experiment. In order to protect cultures from nematodes, Furadan was applied in the soil prior to planting. Poultry manure was applied as fertilizer, 10 days later with intensive water irrigation. After planting additional fertilizers with N-P-K in a ratio 10-10-20 and poultry manure were applied 2weeks after planting. Crops were watered daily using a sprinkler. The experimental design consisted in 35 plots of 2100 plants in a randomized bloc design. Cabbage crop were planted in 35 plots of 60 plants each, placed in six rows of 10 plants each. The spacing between rows was fixed at 40 cm. Treatments were repeated five times. 
 Phytosanitary applications Four treatments were used: Biobit, B. thuringiensis var. kurstaki, Crystal Chemical Company LTD (Europe), Neem (Suneem, Azadirachta indica 1% EC), alternation Biobit/Neem (in 10 days interval four times) and Dimethoate (Meteor 400 EC). An untreated control was also included in the experiment. Biobit was applied at 1L for 100 L of water per hectare. As for the Neem treatment, the dosage was 1L/ha. Dimethoate was applied at 1.5 L/ha. Applications started 25 days after planting; crops were treated using manual sprayer every ten days. For the alternated treatment Biobit/Neem, four timely applications were used: Neem was applied first and the last application was Biobit. These alternated applications were stopped 20 days before the other treatments. 
 Sampling methods Samples were collected randomly by selecting 10 cabbage heads in the central row of each plot. The number of insects such as larva and pupae of P. xylostella and cocoons of parasitoids was recorded. Other insect pests including larvae of Hellula undalis Fabricius (Pyralidae), Aphididae and Aleyrodidae within a cabbage were all collected and counted in each treatment. Eggs and larvae of P. xylostella which, were inside the leaves were not considered. In each treatment, the diameter of each cabbagehead plant was measured with a ruler. The cabbage heads were weighted at harvest with an electronic balance. The yield of cabbage was recorded for each treatment. The samplings started 10 days planting and were performed every ten days. 
 Data management Data were normalized and subjected to ANOVA, and post-ANOVA comparisons of means were made using Student-Newman-Keuls test. The relations between agronomic features and pest infestation and the presence of parasitoids was determined using Pearson's correlation. The level of significance was kept at 5% in all data analysis. 
 RESULTS 
 Interactions between agronomic parameters and insect pest infestations The results show that agronomic features of cabbages such as the number of leaves, the weight and the diameter of cabbageheads were related to the level of pest  (Table 1) . However, there was no relation between the infestation of DBM and other pests  (Table 1) . 
 Infestation levels of Plutella xylostella and other pests There were significant differences between treatments on the infestation levels of P. xylostella (F (4, 24) = 63.14; P < 0.0001) and other pests (F (4, 24) = 14.16; P < 0.0001). P. xylostella infestation was significantly higher in the chemical treatment and in the control. There were no significant differences between the treatments Biobit, Neem and Biobit/Neem. The infestation of other insect pests was higher in the control and was significantly different from the other treatments. However, there was no significant difference between the other treatments (  Figure 2 ). 
 Effect of treatments on agronomic parameters and yield There were significant differences between treatments on the weight (F (4,24) = 4.19; P = 0.002), the diameter (F (4,24) = 2.39; P = 0,049) and the number of leaves of cabbages (F (4,24) = 3.63; P = 0.006). The highest weights were recorded on the Biobit treatment and were not significantly different from Neem and the alternation Biobit/Neem. However, there were significant differences between Biobit and Dimethoate and the control. There were no significant differences between Neem, Biobit, Dimethoate and the control (  Table 2 ). The diameter of cabbage was higher in the Biobit treatment but was not significantly different from the Neem treatment. There were no significant differences between Neem and Biobit/Neem, Dimethoate and the control  (Table 2 ). In terms of number of leaves, there  were no significant differences between Neem, Biobit/Neem, Dimethoate and the control. However, there were significant differences between Biobit and Dimethoate and between Biobit and the control (  Table 2 ). The yield of cabbage was significantly different between treatments (F (4,24) = 177.69; P < 0.0001;  Figure 3 ). It was significantly higher in treatment Biobit with 12.2 t/ha. There were no significant differences between alternated treatment and the treatments Biobit and Neem (P˃0.05). However, the yield was significantly lower in plants treated with Dimethoate and in control; respectively yields of 7.2 t / ha and 7.1 t / ha. 
 Interactions between agronomic parameters and parasitoids There was a significant relation between the agronomical characters of cabbages: weight, diameter and number of leaves and the presence of parasitoids (   (Table 3) . 
 DISCUSSION The level of pest infestation was significantly different between treatments however; P. xylostella infestation was not significantly different between the treatments Biobit, Neem and the alternation Biobit/Neem. Although significantly higher in the control, the level of infestation of other pests was not significantly different between Biobit, Neem, Biobit/Neem and Dimethoate. These results suggest that apart from damages caused by P.  xylostella, the contribution of the other pests in the damage on cabbage is negligible. The application of B. thuringiensis against DBM and other lepidopteran pests has been recommended by many authors  (Lereclus et al., 1993; Kibata, 1996) . B. thuringiensis seems to present many advantages. Although, there were no significant differences between Biobit, Neem and the alternation, the application of B. thuringiensis recorded the highest weights and the diameters of cabbageheads. However, there were no significant differences between Biobit, Neem and the alternation. This suggests that alternated treatment of Biobit and Neem which, is timely applied only on four occasions, could achieve similar results than solo treatment of Biobit and Neem. Similar findings have been demonstrated by many scientists  (Wright, 2002; Prasad et al., 2007; Roh et al., 2007) . As for the number of leaves, results showed that the control recorded the highest values. The Biobit treatment was the lowest however, not significantly different from Neem and Biobit/Neem. The importance of the number of leaves could be considered as response to challenges or stresses causes by P. xylostella damages on the plants  (Ayalew, 2006) . As larvae of DBM develop on cabbage leaves, they prevent physiological processes such as photosynthesis and respiration. As a response, more leaves are generated by the plant to bypass the stress  (Wojciechowska and Leja, 1999; You and Yang, 2001) . The higher yield observed in the treatments plants Biobit, Neem and alternating treatment could be explained by the low infestation levels of P. xylostella. The use of B. thuringiensis based formulations can increase yields  (Huang et al., 2005; Cattaneo et al., 2006; Herdt, 2006) . According to the Horticulture Development Centre (HRC), the standard yield of cabbage is estimated between 10 and 20 t / ha. Yield reductions are also due to damage Hellula undalis. The presence of other pests in the cabbages, particularly H. undalis (Lep., Pyralidae) whose larvae eat the terminal bud of newly planted cabbages, thus inducing growth of the axillary buds which produce unmarketable multiple heads at harvest  (Goudegnon et al., 2000) . In this study, there were no significant differences between treatments on the presence of other pests. The low yields observed in the treatment with dimethoate and controls are primarily caused by the damage of P. xylostella. According to  Ayalew (2006) , the yield losses in cabbage may vary considerably depending on the levels of pest infestation. The application of B. thuringiensis and Neem has been regarded as less harmful to beneficials such as parasitoid wasps and natural enemies as compared to chemical pesticides  (Roh et al., 2007) . Results of this study showed that, there were significant relation between the presence of parasitoids and the agronomic features. The parasitoid O. sokolowski and A. litae seem to be more contributors to the agronomic features of the cabbage which is a considerable gain to the farmer. The study revealed that as far as cabbage production is concerned, it is better to rely on biocontrol agents than to apply synthetic chemical pesticides. This could be explained by negative effects of synthetic chemicals on the complex of natural enemies and the induction of resistance to pest populations. The use of alternated treatment can therefore be an opportunity to mitigate both pest infestation and manage the apparition of resistance. It has been demonstrated that uncontrolled application of B. thuringiensis could be the source of resistance induction in DBM  (Chilcutt and Tabashnik, 1999; Monnerat et al., 2000) . As a conclusion, cabbage is one of the most difficult crops to grow and to sell in Africa particularly in Africa; this is due to heavy physical damages that occur on the leaves and discourage costumers. On the other hand, the use of high rates of synthetic chemicals can compromise the quality of cabbages exempted from damages. The study showed that by using four timely applications of Biobit and Neem, it is possible to achieve an efficient biological control against the DBM and to produce safe cabbage crops. The technique is cost-effective and therefore can be recommended to farmers in developing countries. Figure 1 . 1 Study site.

In human consumption, wheat ranks as the second most-produced crop plant after rice, and wheat is grown on more land area than any other commercial crop (see http://faostat3.fao .org/home/E). Xanthomonas translucens pv. cerealis has been found on crops, like wheat (Triticum spp.), barley (Hordeum spp.), and rye (Secale cereale)  (1) (2) (3) , and it also naturally occurs on smooth bromegrass and quack grass  (4) . Bacterial leaf streak caused by strains of X. translucens (5) is the most common bacterial disease of wheat. As a seed-borne disease, it is a constraint for international germplasm exchange  (6) . The symptoms include translucent stripes at the leaf blade at the early infection state, which later develop into elongated water-soaked lesions, as well as the production of exudates at late infection state  (7) . While most plant-pathogenic xanthomonads studied thus far belong to the group II clade, the strains of X. translucens belong to the group I clade, which also includes the species Xanthomonas albilineans, Xanthomonas hyacinthi, Xanthomonas sacchari, and Xanthomonas theicola  (8) . Pathotype strain CFBP 2541 (LMG 679, NCPPB 1944) was isolated from Bromus inermis in the United States in 1941. We tested this strain on barley (Hordeum vulgare L. Morex and Betzes) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L. Alondra) under laboratory conditions. Strong symptoms were obtained with the ""Morex"" and ""Alondra"" plants, while ""Betzes"" remained symptomless. To obtain new insights into the molecular determinants provoking disease or resistance, we sequenced strain CFBP 2541 using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (GATC Biotech, Germany). The shotgun sequencing yielded 59,447,151 read pairs (26,337,209 100-bp paired-end reads, with an insert size of 250 bp, and 33,109,942 50-bp mate-pair reads, with an insert size of 3 kb). A combination of Velvet (9), SOAPdenovo, and SOAPGapCloser (10) yielded 31 contigs Ͼ500 bp (N 50 , 1,399,657 bp), with the largest contig being 1,809 kb, for a total assembly size of 4,515,938 bp, corresponding to 1,926ϫ coverage. The genome was found to encode a noncanonical hypersensitive response and pathogenicity (Hrp) type III protein secretion system, the genetic organization of which differs from that of clade II xanthomonads, as previously reported for X. translucens pv. graminis strain Xtg29  (11) . In contrast to strain Xtg29, however, the genome assembly of strain CFBP 2541 indicated the presence of two type III transcription activator-like (TAL) effector genes  (12, 13) , which was supported by Southern blot hybridization. Since tal genes are notoriously difficult to be assembled from short reads due to their repetitive nature, we sequenced the tal genes upon PCR amplification. Surprisingly, the two genome-assembled tal genes turned out to be correctly assembled, probably due to the very high coverage and a significant number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (on average, 1 per 10 bp) that distinguish all individual repeats from each other. This information opens the way for studying the role of tal genes in the pathogenicity of X. translucens. Nucleotide sequence accession numbers.

These two coefficients are fixed. Conclusion. The model allows an estimate of pineapple RLD and its spatial variability from simple counts of roots on a soil profile. A practical example of this model is given, characterizing and comparing in situ root profiles of pineapple plants.

Merr.) from root counts on soil profiles in Martinique (French West Indies),,"Introduction Pineapple (Ananas comosus (L.) Merr) is widely produced in a variety of habitats from sub-tropical to tropical areas. Commercial production is mainly based on intensive monoculture cropping systems. According to the new European regulations, the infestation of pineapple by the soil-borne parasites Rotylenchulus reniformis and symphyla can no longer be controlled by pesticides in the French West Indies. These parasites reduce the efficiency of water and mineral uptake by the plant as well as weakening its anchoring in the soil. New cropping systems based on more ecological farming practices  [1]  aim to improve pest management and root development, but no tools are available to monitor and quantify the impact of new cultural practices on the parasites and on root development. The spatial distribution of root length density (RLD) in the soil plays a key role in water and nutrient uptake  [2] . RLD is also a good indicator of the impact of new cultural practices on root development in the soil. Characterizing the features of the pineapple root system, especially the spatial distribution of the RLD, is thus essential. However, assessing the spatial distribution of RLD in the field is not easy because of the difficulty involved in extracting a large enough representative part of the root system due to variable root distribution, soil properties and the fragile pineapple roots. Several RLD measurement methods have already been described  [3] , but their implementation in the field is often costly and the data they produce are not necessarily representative of the real variability of root distribution. Mapping root intersections in a soil profile using the trench-profile method  [4] , which gives the root intersection density (RID), has the advantage of being possible in the field and facilitates the study of root distribution in the soil  [2, 5] ; however, it provides no direct information on RLD. Direct empirical relationships between RID and RLD have been tested in wheat  [6]  and maize  [7] , but the robustness of the relationships obtained with this approach was often poor. A mathematical relationship between the intersection density on one side of a cube of soil and the RLD inside the same cube was formulated and found to depend on the degree of root anisotropy and orientation  [8, 9] . This relationship was used and adapted for maize in the field, and led to the development of a model to describe RLD for maize from root counts in trench profiles in the field  [7] . Other models describing RLD from root counts in trench profiles have also been developed for sorghum  [10] , upland rice  [11]  and sugar cane  [12] . This kind of model has never been developed for pineapple, and to date, studies of the pineapple root system have been limited to non-quantitative observations on cultural profiles or on plants that had been removed from the soil. The aim of the present work was to highlight the preferential orientations of pineapple roots and to develop a robust and cost-effective method for estimating RLD from root intersection counts on soil profiles. These results should be helpful for future studies of relationships between pineapple root growth, the cropping system and soil-borne parasitism. Root intersection density sampling and measurement procedure. a: a three-sided (0.01 m 2 ) partial steel cube sampling device, b: a sampling device in the soil profile, with sides oriented according to the soil surface and plant row (h: horizontal, l: longitudinal, t: transversal). 
 Materials and methods 
 Analysis of pineapple root anisotropy and root orientation as a preliminary study to model root length density (RLD) The first approach used to estimate this relationship was to establish simple empirical regressions between RID and RLD. For maize  [7, 12]  and other crops it was found to be better to take the main root orientations into account in the model, so this second approach was also used. The theoretical aspects of the relationship between RID and RLD were analyzed by van Noordwijk  [9] , taking the root orientation relative to the counting plane into account. Measuring the root intersections on three perpendicular sides of a soil cube oriented according to the soil surface and plant row (figure 1): horizontal (h), transversal (t) and longitudinal (l) enables determination of the root anisotropy factor (AN)  [8, 9]  through the following relationship: AN = (RIDh−RIDm) 2 +(RIDt−RIDm) 2 +(RIDl−RIDm) 2 (6.RIDm 2 ) (1) where RIDm is the mean RID of the three sides. AN, dimensionless, ranges from 0 (isotropy) to 1 (parallel roots). If all the roots were completely perpendicular to the counting plane, each root intersection would correspond to a root length equal to the cube side. Pineapple (cultivar MD2, 4 months old) was grown in an experimental field in northern Martinique (French West Indies, Lat 14 • 4 N, Long. 61 • 0 W) on a young volcanic allophanic soil (andosol). Average annual rainfall under the wet tropical climate ranges from 2,000 to 3,000 mm, and the rain falls mainly from June to November. The crop was managed according to the locally recommended cropping method with tillage, chemical fertilization and pineapples planted in double rows on ridges (figure 2). The mean daily temperatures were never lower than 23 • C. In order to analyze root anisotropy and orientation, root measurements were obtained in triplicate at 4 months after planting (MAP). In each sample, roots were sampled from trench profiles dug in three different ridges. The standard RID and RLD sampling procedure was based on the extraction of 1-dm 3 cubes of undisturbed soil from open profiles using a three-sided steel cube with 10-cm long edges that were sharpened to facilitate soil penetration (  figure 1) . This sampling device was pressed down through the soil profile until its back edge was level with the soil surface. It was then pulled back out of the soil and excess soil from the three open sides of the device was shaved off to obtain a soil cube. A second sample was taken at the same depth but the open sides of the sampling device were oriented in the opposite direction from that in the first sample so as to obtain -with the two soil cube samples -six open sides of the cube for the root counts. Immediately after sampling, the sides of the soil cube were sprayed with water to make the root intersections easier to see and the intersecting roots visible on the three open sides of the soil cubes were counted. The number of root intersections (NI) enables us to calculate the root intersection densities (RID) for the three open sides: horizontal (h), transversal (t) and longitudinal (l) of each soil cube (figure 1), resulting in three RIDs, which were expressed in relation to the surface area of the side of the cube. The soil cubes were then brought to the laboratory and under running tap water, the roots were separated from the soil on a 1-mm-mesh sieve. As is true for many crops, pineapple root diameters vary considerably. To determine the main root directions, it is important to distinguish between fine roots (diameter d < 0.7 mm) and thick roots (d > 0.7 mm) because they may grow in different directions. This simple distribution into two categories facilitates field observations. It was assumed that thick roots were shoot-borne and that fine roots were lateral branching roots. Preliminary studies based on full root systems have shown that this is actually the case. Hereafter, we refer to thick, fine or all roots using t, f or a indices, respectively. Next, for each sample, we determined the lengths of the fine roots and the thick roots using the line intersect method  [13, 14]  to obtain the root length density (RLD). A total of 18 samples (1 dm 3 of soil each) were extracted from the soil. 
 Modeling RLD from RID To develop the RLD model, we first selected the best method to correlate root intersection densities (RID) and root length densities (RLD), and then validated the prediction of RLD on the basis of root intersection counts (NI) in a soil plane. RLD was modeled only on the basis of measurements of root intersections on a vertical plane because this method is the most commonly used in studies of roots on soil profiles. The reference plane (v) was therefore systematically the vertical-transversal plane. According to Lang  [8]  and Van Noordwijk  [9] , RLD can be calculated (RLDc) on the basis of RID measured in a vertical soil plane (v), by taking the root distribution (anisotropy and preferentially orientation) into account. A vertical coefficient (Pv) is calculated for this plane, with h representing the horizontal plane. Pv = RIDh/RIDv (2) If Pv > 1 or < 1, the roots have a preferential, respectively parallel or perpendicular orientation relative to the vertical measurement plane v. For Pv = 1, RLDc = 2RIDv  [8] . These equations are used hereafter to calculate RLDc values from Pv and RIDv. They can be combined in a general equation with an orientation coefficient (CO) representing the different aggregated factors for Pv in Equation  (2) : RLDc = RIDv × COv (3) Additional samples needed to validate the preliminary RLD model were collected at two industrial pineapple farms: (i) Gradis farm (elevation 300 m asl.), and (ii) Leyritz farm (elevation 200 m asl.), both using MD2 cultivars grown on the andosol that is typical of Martinique. The cropping systems were similar to the one used in the first experiment. Root samples were sampled below the ridge from trench profiles 4 months after planting (MAP) at Gradis, and 9 MAP at Leyritz, using the same method (double soil cubes) as that used in the first experiment. The soil cubes removed between the surface and a depth of 30 cm came from 9 samples at Leyritz and 7 samples at Gradis. The soil cubes removed between 30-and 60-cm deep came from six samples at Leyritz. Finally, 22 sets of field data were available for model validation. Relationships between RLD values measured in the soil cubes (RLDm) and estimated by the models (RLDc) were tested taking into account the slope, standard error of the slope (SE), intercept and regression (R 2 ). Differences between RLDm and RLDc were also analyzed by the following statistical quantities: the Nash efficiency coefficient (NE)  [20] , root mean square error (RMSE)  [21] ) and mean bias (MB). NE, RMSE and MB should be as close as possible to 1.0% and 0%, respectively. 
 From RID on a trench profile to RLD mapping using the pineapple model To estimate RLD from the number of root intersections (NI), the RLD model was used in the same field on Leyritz farm as the field used for model validation ( § 2.2). Three soil profiles (width 90 cm and depth 60 cm) were opened in three different ridges perpendicular to the rows of pineapple. Root counts (NI) were carried out on each profile using a 5-cmmesh grid to identify the spatial coordinates of the measurements (root mapping)  [15, 16] . The NI data were entered in Racine2 software  [17]  and used to calculate the RLD per unit cell of 25-cm 2 area with the RLD model. The cell-by-cell spatialized values of RLD made it possible to estimate the percentage volume of soil potentially able to ensure a sufficient supply of water or minerals to the plant, taking possible competition between the roots into account. Another model makes it possible to estimate the potential root extraction ratio (PRER), which depends on the distance between the roots calculated from the RLD and the estimate of the maximum migration distances of water or minerals from the soil toward the root  [18, 19] . The maximum distance selected, editable in the software, was 2 cm. 
 Results and discussion 
 Root length densities of fine and thick roots of MD2 The root length densities between the surface and a depth of 30 cm differed considerably among the three sites  (table I) . At all three sites, the RLD were mainly due to the fine roots (Ø < 0.7 mm). From a depth of 30 cm to 60 cm, no roots were found in some cubes. The root system of pineapple had a high RLD. Between the surface and a depth of 30 cm, the average RLD was 21.4 m dm −3 (table I) and was sometimes more than 40 m dm −3 of soil near the soil surface (  figure 9 ). For the purpose of comparison, sugar cane  [12, 13]  and sorghum  [10]  have a maximum root length density of 20,000 and 26,000 m m −3 of soil, respectively. Pineapple roots are mainly located in the top 30-cm layer of the soil in the ridges with, in our conditions, a root front located about 60 cm from the plant. Sugarcane and sorghum have a much deeper root system which, in sugarcane, can penetrate to a depth of 4 m  [22] . The root system of upland rice is characterized by a higher root length density (50 m dm −3 ) in the top soil layer, at least in the case of high-yield varieties grown under favorable conditions  [11] . Although upland rice and pineapple are two very different species, they both have high RLD near the surface characterized by a large amount of fine roots and a shallow root system. 
 Root anisotropy and orientation in the 0-30-cm soil layer Root anisotropy and orientation were characterized by the AN and P coefficients (Equations 1 and 2) measuring root intersections on the three perpendicular sides of the soil cubes. Anisotropy levels were low. Based on the data set for all the roots (fine and thick), the mean anisotropy coefficient (AN) was less than 0.35, suggesting that root distribution was close to isotropy (table II). The average difference in the orientation coefficient for the vertical faces t and l (Pt = 1.095, Pl = 1.085) was very low, so the data from the two vertical faces were merged to calculate only one coefficient for the vertical faces (Pv) and to model the RLD. The mean value of the P orientation coefficients was less than 1.45 for the fine roots and for all the roots, and 1.5 for the thick roots, indicating a slight preferential vertical orientation of the roots (P > 1). The COv coefficient value calculated from Equations 2 and 3  [8, 9]  was 2.65 for all the roots and 2.73 for the thick roots. So, the root system geometry was close to isotropy (CO = 2 for isotropy) but had a slight vertical orientation. This COv coefficient was used to develop a geometric model to correlate root intersection on a vertical plane (RIDv) and RLD, taking root geometry into account. 
 Prediction of root length density from root counts on a trench profile: model formulation and calibration 
 All roots Geometric model 1 (theoretical): a theoretical geometric model 1 was used to predict the measured RLD (RLDm), by calculating a RLDc from NI and CO coefficients: RLDc = RIDv × COv (4) where RIDv is given by the merged NI counts on the vertical faces (longitudinal and transversal) expressed as a function of the unit of area. The calculated all root length density (RLDc) obtained through (Eq. 4) led to a substantial bias (figure 3 and Eq. 5). RLDm = 1.691 × RLDc n = 9 R 2 = 0.796 P < 0.001 (5) Geometric model 2: in the geometric model 2, the discrepancy between the measured and calculated RLD with the model 1 is described by an empirical term, CE. The value of CE is the mean value of RLDm/RLDc (RLD calculated for the geometric model 1) and the CE value is also the slope in  figure 3  and the coefficient in Equation 5 (CE = 1.691). Model 2 to calculate RLD was structured as follows: RLD = RID × CO × CE (6) with CO and CE according to table II (2.65) and Equation  5  (1.69). The empirical term CE has a constant value which is not related either to the RID or to depth (Eq. 5). A constant CE coefficient (CE = 1.45) has also been determined in upland rice  [11] . For fine roots of sugarcane, the CE was found to be proportional to RID  [12] . Values were from 1 to 2, close to those for pineapple. The most probable origin of the gap between RLDc (Eq. 4) and RLDm is that a significant proportion of fine roots were not counted due to the difficulties involved in counting them in the field  [23] . Conventional methods of washing the soil samples can also lead to the loss of a significant proportion of roots  [24] . In developing the model in the present study, great care was taken with root length measurements in order to obtain a data set of measured root lengths as close as possible to the actual value. Empirical model: because of the low anisotropy of pineapple roots  (table II) , another simpler approach could be used, ignoring variations in root orientation and establishing a direct relation between the root intersection density counted on the vertical sides of the cube and the root length density measured inside the cube. For the all root data set (a), the linear regression between RIDv (from NI counts) and RLDa (figure 4) was: RLDa = 4.481 × RIDv n = 9 R 2 = 0.796 P < 0.001  (7)  This relation was acceptable taking the methods of measurement and the variability of field data into account. Both approaches, empirical (RLD = 4.48 × RID ) and geometric (RLD = 2.65 × 1.69 × RID), led to very similar calculated values due to the low anisotropy of pineapple roots. Data for the fine roots, which account for the majority of the root lengths in our samples, also showed low anisotropy, and were very close to the all root data.   
 Thick roots Empirical and geometric models: the thick roots in this data set were short (table I) and one sample had no roots at all on two vertical sides of the cubes; consequently, it was not possible to develop a geometric model. A simple model was developed that established a direct relation between the root intersection density of the thick roots (RIDt) counted on the vertical sides of the cube and the root length density of the thick roots (RLDt) measured inside the cube. The linear regression (  figure 5)  between RIDt and RLDt led to  Equation 8 . Taking into account the methods of measurement and the variability of field data, the relation is acceptable. RLDt = 2.52 × RIDt n = 8 R 2 = 0.621 (8) 
 Testing the models 
 All root data set For the all root data set (n = 22), the geometric (Eq. 6) and empirical (Eq. 7) models we developed to estimate RLD  from RID were tested using an independent data set (different sites, different soils, different climate). The validation results are summarized in table III and  figure 6 . The two models satisfactorily estimated root length density according to the slope, intercept and R 2 of the regressions and other statistical quantities: the Nash efficiency coefficient, root mean square error and mean bias. The statistical quantities are close to models tested for upland rice: bias 3%, RMSE 37% NE 0.9  [11] . The empirical and geometric models gave very similar predicted values for RLDc, with root densities ranging from 200 to 45,000 m m −3 of soil, which correspond to average distances between roots 8.5 and 0.6 cm long, respectively. 
 Thick roots The validation results are summarized in  table III and figure 7.  The empirical model provided a less satisfactory RLDc for thick roots than the one based on all root data. All the statistical quantities calculated confirmed this result, the slope, the intercept and R 2 of the regression and three other statistical quantities including the Nash efficiency coefficient, root mean square error and mean bias. 
 An example of the use of the model to describe RLD distribution in soil and its potential root extraction ratio (PRER) for water and nutrient uptake As is true for most crops, the distribution of pineapple roots in the soil is not uniform but shows both vertical and horizontal gradients. Spatial variability is also related to the type of soil,  the cultural practices and the level of parasitism  [25] . This irregularity may disturb plant access to soil resources. Nevertheless, root profiles are conventionally estimated from average RLD values in the different soil layers. Mapping root intersections using the trench-profile method with a grid to facilitate spatialized measurements  [13, 14] , combined with the model proposed above (Eq. 6), enabled the spatial estimation of RLD from NI. Data management for the calculation of spatialized RLD and mapping with the software Racine2  [15]  made it possible to describe root profiles taking depth into account, as is the case with conventional methods. The method was used to describe three soil profiles (90 cm wide by 60 cm deep) in three different ridges in the same field at Leyritz farm (  figure 8) . Root length density in the three profiles decreased with depth, with differences from one profile to another. The RLD in profile R3 was low between the surface and a depth of 10 cm but good below 20 cm. In contrast, in the R1 profile, the RLD was low at depth. This type of result allows a preliminary qualitative and quantitative analysis of the root system, but does not allow the comparison of gradients, heterogeneity and clumping at the same depth in the 3 profiles. The mapping of root intersection densities (RID) and the use of the model proposed in this paper can describe the root systems through RLD maps (  figure 9) . These maps allow a visualization of the results of the RLD profiles depicted in figure 8. They can enrich the analysis of the distribution of the pineapple root system. On the maps, the variability of root profiles from one profile to another is spectacular. In all three profiles, the horizontal variability was quite large, including places without any roots between the surface and a depth of 20 cm. The greatest root density close to the surface (0-20 cm) was measured in profile R2 in which some areas had more than 4 cm of roots per cm 3 of soil, which is high. However, the distribution of roots in this profile was more heterogeneous. The R3 profile had the lowest RLD at the soil surface, but the distribution was fairly regular at depth. The map obtained from the average RLD of the three profiles (  figure 9B)  is complementary to the map in  figure 9A . The average of three values (for RP1, RP2 and RP3 in the A figures) reduced the heterogeneity of root distribution. Between 0 and 30 cm in depth, practically no more 25-cm 2 cells without roots were observed. Information on the spatial variability of the root system was lost, but the average gradient and a limit at a depth of about 25 cm was clearly visible. In this case, the limit corresponded to a change in the physical state of the soil, but it could have had other causes. The information provided by the PRER is different fromand complementary to -the information provided by the RLD  (table IV) . Thus, in profile R2, (i) in the 0-20 cm soil layer, the RLD was 36% higher than the RLD in profile R3, whereas the PRER was 7% lower; (ii) in the 20-40 cm and 40-60 cm layers, the RLD represented, respectively, 23% and 6% of the RLD in the 0-20 cm soil layer, whereas the PRER still represented 62% and 34%. To describe the quality of the root system and for a better understanding and modeling of its functional activity, this information may be more useful than the RLD alone. 
 Conclusion This study provides new information on pineapple root orientations in the soil. Both thick and fine roots were shown to be relatively isotropic with a slight vertical orientation. This advances our previously limited understanding of the architecture of pineapple roots. Models that correlate the root intersection density (RID) on a vertical profile and root length density (RLD) were developed and validated on the basis of these findings. The first model (geometric) used a CO coefficient and an experimental coefficient CE: The second model came from a linear regression fitting the direct relationship between measured RLD and RID. Developing the geometric model required counting the RID on three soil planes. The two models gave similar estimations of RLD. They could be used to predict RLD in the field on the basis of RID measured on a single vertical plane. The two models are accurate enough for RLD estimates in the field, if the aim is easy data acquisition for the analysis of root distribution in a particular soil. For studies of soil-crop relationships or water and nutrient uptake  [2, 18, 19, 25] , our models make it possible to map root intersections on a plane (trench-profile method) or in rhizotrons to determine both the root length density and its spatial variability, which are standard root parameters for water and nutrient uptake. Running this method is simple, it only involves opening a pit and counting root intersections on the soil profile by mapping them using a grid. Complicated and time-consuming standard procedures (sampling, root extraction, preparation and measurements of root length) are thus not required unless obtaining highly accurate results is the prime concern  [14] .

R. solanacearum infects plant vascular systems, causing diverse bacterial wilt diseases. Its extensive host range, together with a wide geographic distribution, makes it one of the world's most destructive crop pathogens  [2] . R. solanacearum has many distinct lineages within a heterogeneous and taxonomically disputed species complex. Extensive phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that the species complex contains four phylotypes that correspond to geographic origin; phylotype I strains originated in Asia, phylotype II strains came from the Americas, phylotype III strains originated in Africa, and phylotype IV strains are from the Indonesian archipelago  [3] . Within each phylotype, strains can be further subclassified into sequevars based on the similarity of a 750-bp fragment of the endoglucases (egl) gene  [3] . R. solanacearum strains share a conserved core genome that is presumably essential for their common biology: colonizing plant xylem vessels and causing wilt symptoms  [4, 5] . However, the group's pan-genome contains over 16,000 coding sequences (CDSs), and individual strains in the species complex vary enormously with respect to both epidemiology and host range. For example, the R. solanacearum species complex includes strains adapted to eucalyptus, mulberry, clove, ginger, banana, peanut, and solanaceous plants  [1] . Functional genetic analyses have identified many of R. solanacearum's broadly conserved common virulence mechanisms  [6, 7] . However, the molecular processes that are responsible for strains' adaptation to particular hosts are not well understood. A few studies have identified specific type III effectors and metabolic traits associated with host range  [8] [9] [10] [11] . However, these findings were validated in only a few model strains using plants that fail to represent the large diversity of the species complex's host range. Previous comparative analyses did not identify strong host specificity factors but were based on strains with a limited genetic diversity or failed to consider the entire host spectrum of each strain  [12, 13] . A recent study that characterized the bacterium's genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity allowed us to select new model strains and to further explore the underlying mechanisms that determine host range  [14] . Microarray and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analyses and surveys of biological diversity demonstrated the existence of several clonal lineages adapted to specific host plants inside the American phylotype II group of the R. solanacearum species complex  [12, [14] [15] [16] . Lineages consisting of strains with similar host ranges are grouped into ecotypes, as they represent genetically distinct populations adapted to particular ecological niches within the R. solanacearum species complex (RSSC). These lineages include the banana Moko disease-causing strains, the cold-tolerant potato brown rot strains (historically and for regulatory purposes known as Race 3, biovar 2 or R3bv2) and the Not Pathogenic to Banana (NPB) strains, a recently emerged group that does not wilt banana despite its phylogenetic location in sequevar 4; all other sequevar 4 strains cause Moko disease. We hypothesized that host range determinants could be identified by comparing the genomes of closely related strains that have highly divergent host ranges. The polyphyletic nature of the Moko ecotype and the unexpectedly close relationship of some Moko lineages to the monophyletic brown rot and NPB ecotypes make these highly adapted strains a robust model for the study of host adaptation. In this study, we sequenced a representative group of strains from each of these ecotypes and analyzed their genomes using multiple comparative genomics methods. Genomes were compared using phyletic profiling to determine ecotype-specific gene content. We identified genetic variations associated with NPB and brown rot strains emergence. To gain a better understanding of the polyphyly of Moko strains, horizontal gene transfers (HGTs) were also investigated using an explicit phylogenetic method. Each of these analyses has proven successful in several other plant pathogenic bacteria, including Pseudomonas syringae  [17]  and Xanthomonas sp.  [18, 19] , and has provided evidence that specific gene content, genetic variations and HGT can explain host adaptation. These comparative genomic analyses identified several virulence factors associated with NPB and brown rot strain emergence, along with Moko strain polyphyly. However, there were surprisingly few differences in lineage-specific gene content that could explain the host adaptation of the various lineages despite the high plasticity of the pan-genome. 
 Results Host-adapted strains from phylotype II offer a model to study host adaptation The general features of the R. solanacearum genomes analyzed in this study are presented in  Table 1 . We selected eight phylotype II strains for sequencing based on their sequevar classifications and on phenotypic data that indicated host adaptation. Eleven additional RSSC genomes were obtained from public databases. The three brown rot strains form a monophyletic group adapted to temperate climate; these sequevar 1 strains are typically isolated from potato in the highland tropics. The Moko disease strains form a polyphyletic group adapted to banana and are represented in this analysis by seven strains from sequevars 3, 4, 6 and 24, all isolated from plants in the genus Musa. The NPB strains form an emerging monophyletic group that appears to have diverged recently from Musa-infecting strains in sequevar 4. This group is represented by two strains, one isolated from Cucumis and one from Heliconia  [15] . We determined draft sequences of a total of eight new phylotype II draft genomes. The resulting whole-genome data were used to confirm the phylogenetic relationships previously inferred from the phylotype-sequevar classification. We used Maximum Unique Matches index (MUMi) genomic distances  [20]  to generate a new, more complete phylogenetic tree of the R. solanacearum species complex (  Figure 1 ). The tree exhibits a similar topology as the previously inferred phylogeny, which was based on microarray or MLST data. Although the strains in phylotype II are closely related to the relative context of the species complex, the Moko group is clearly polyphyletic and includes four distinct lineages that correspond to sequevars 3, 4, 6 and 24. Interestingly, Moko sequevar 3 is closely related to the monophyletic potato brown rot lineage, and Moko sequevar 4 is even more closely related to the monophyletic NPB lineage. To confirm the host-adapted nature of the selected phylotype II strains, we initially conducted pathogenicity assays under tropical conditions using tomato, potato, banana (Musa), melon (Cucumis) and Anthurium as representative hosts. The pathogenicity profiles obtained from these assays clearly demonstrate the host adaptation of each group (  Figure 2 ). Moko strains from sequevars 3, 4, 6 and 24 wilted banana plants, but the sequevar 4-NPB strains did not. The NPB strains were the only group able to infect melon and Anthurium plants. Finally, Moko, NPB, and brown rot strains can all infect potato plants at warm temperatures, but only brown rot strains are highly virulent under cooler temperate conditions  [14] . It is important to note that not all strains in phylotype II exhibit this degree of host adaptation. For example, and as expected from the literature, the broad host range of R. solanacearum type strain K60 (which also causes disease in tobacco, eggplant, and pepper) did not extend to banana, melon or anthurium under our experimental conditions. Genomic diversity of phylotype II and the R. solanacearum species complex A total of 16,757 distinct homolog families were identified across the 19 R. solanacearum genomes; we consider these homologs to be the current pan-genome of the species complex. Compared with a previous genomic analysis of eight R. solanacearum genomes  [5] , our results expand the pan-genome size by~70%. The inclusion of previously unsequenced and phylogenetically distinct lineages, notably sequevars 4, 6 and 24, explains the steep increase in the pan-genome size. The 1,940 loci conserved in all strains constitute the current R. solanacearum core genome, which represents 17% of the pan-genome and 35% of an average R. solanacearum genome, which contains~5,500 CDSs. Ecotype-specific gene content was determined by individually comparing each ecotype to every other sequenced genome. The NPB and brown rot strains each exhibited only a few unique genes specific to their phylogenetic groups: 99 and 109, respectively (  Figure 3 ). The Moko strains are unlikely to exhibit specific genes because this polyphyletic group is composed of distant lineages. Three hypotheses can explain the emergence of a polyphyletic Moko ecotype. First, the most common recent ancestor (MRCA) of phylotype II may have been adapted to bananas. During the subsequent clonal expansion, variations in environmental selection pressures may have promoted maintenance of the ancient phenotype in certain lineages (which still cause Moko disease) and promoted its loss in others. Alternatively, because R. solanacearum is capable of natural transformation  [21] , pathogenicity to banana may have originated in an isolated lineage after divergence from the MRCA. Subsequently, the banana-infecting trait(s) may have spread to multiple phylotype II lineages via HGT, resulting in the current polyphyletic Moko group. A third possibility is that multiple lineages underwent convergent evolution towards the banana-infecting trait, which is consistent with the absence of ecotype-specific genes. We selected a subset of 227 known or likely virulence factors from the pan-genome based on the literature and manually annotated them (Additional file 1). These virulence factors have a broad range of functions during pathogenesis, including the secretion and synthesis of type III effectors (T3es), motility, chemotaxis, synthesis of exopolysaccharide (EPS), and degradation of plant cell walls. Compared with the other virulence factors, the T3e repertoire of R. solanacearum exhibits high plasticity. The pan-effectome of the species complex contains 113 T3es, but of those, only 14 effectors are present in every sequenced strain. These 14 effectors form the core effectome: RipG5, RipB, RipW, RipAC, RipAB, RipR,  RipE1, RipAM, RipAN, RipAY, RipAJ, RipF1, RipAI and a PopC-like effector. The core effectome represents a~36% size decrease relative to the previously inferred core effectome based on 11 strains  [13] . On average, 64 T3es were present per strain. A total of 40 T3es were common to all Moko strains, whereas 76 were common to NPB strains, and 52 were common to brown rot strains. Due to the large pan-genome, each strain appeared to exhibit highly diverse genetic content even within the Moko, NPB and brown rot groups. This variability can be partially explained by the estimation of gene gain and loss rates along lineages. Indeed, each phylogenetic node of the species complex appears to have undergone hundreds of gain and loss events, thus creating mosaic genomes (Additional file 2). This gain and loss explains why some homolog families are shared by distant lineages but not by closer ones. Nonetheless, it is important to consider that the new genomes are in draft form and are divided into contigs. Thus, these genomes contain fragmented CDSs that can artificially increase the number of predicted gene families and introduce some bias into subsequent analysis. 
 Pairwise comparison of the genomic content of Moko with the NPB and brown rot strains To overcome the problem of these mosaic genomes and to specifically target gene content associated with host adaptation, we hypothesized that the brown rot clade emerged when the IIB-1 brown rot strains diverged from the IIB-3 Moko lineage. Similarly, we hypothesized that the NPB clade emerged when the IIB-4 NPB lineage diverged from the IIB-4 Moko strains. This methodology thus focuses on the evolution of genomic content during emergence events. To test these hypotheses, we directly compared the co-occurrence patterns of genes of the IIB-1 brown rot genomes to those of the Moko genomes and the IIB-4 NPB genomes to the Moko genomes. The first step was to establish which genes were unique to the brown rot and NPB strains compared with the Moko strains. Subsequently, we determined which genes were conserved in every Moko lineage but were absent in either the NPB or brown rot strains (Additional file 3). The NPB strains exhibited 102 unique genes missing from all Moko strains. These genes fell into three putative genomic islands. The first one encoded a type I secretion system (T1SS), including an outer membrane protein (RALP6v1_3180004), a membrane fusion protein (RALP6v1_3180005), and an ATP-binding protein (RALP6v1_ 3180006). This secretion system is located next to a transposase homolog (RALP6v1_3180003), suggesting that the genes were most likely acquired by HGT. The second genomic island contained genes related to the degradation of the plant alkaloid isoquinoline (iorA and iorB) located next to a gene encoding an AraC-type transcriptional regulator. The third genomic island contained a gene with a phosphatase 2C domain, a motif usually found in eukaryotic organisms. Phosphatase 2C can be involved in various cell functions, including the regulation of plant defense in Arabidopsis  [22] , and is sometimes secreted into host cells by pathogens  [23] . The genomic island also contained a gene encoding a putative helixturn-helix (HTH)-type transcriptional regulator as well as transposition-related genes, suggesting that it was also acquired by HGT. Outside of these clearly defined putative genomic islands, CDSs encoding another HTH-type transcriptional regulator and a GGDEF-domain signal transduction protein were unique to the NPB genomes. Only six genes were conserved in Moko strains but absent from NPB strains. Interestingly, this gene-set included ripAA, a well-characterized T3e formerly known as avrA  [8] , which was either absent or pseudogenized in NPB strains. This effector was highly conserved in Moko strains (~85% nucleotide identity) and in the species complex (present in 15 out of the 19 sequenced strains), thus suggesting that ripAA was lost during the emergence of NPB. Another GGDEF-domain signal transduction protein was also absent from the NPB strains. Brown rot strains exhibited 134 conserved genes that were absent from all Moko strains. One hundred three genes coded for conserved proteins of unknown function. However, a BLAST search on NCBI's nr database revealed that several of these hypothetical proteins exhibited homologs in other genera of soil-dwelling and plant pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Xanthomonas, Pseudomonas, Cupriavidus and others). We identified a single putative functional genomic island related to iron metabolism: a FecR homolog (UW551v3_mp40033) located next to an iron transporter (UW551v3_mp40034) and a sigma 70 factor (UW551v3_mp40032). Another gene block coding for hypothetical proteins without significant BLAST hits was also located next to an AraC-type transcriptional regulator. Finally, a member of the RTX exotoxin family (UW551v4_570022) was unique to the brown rot strains. We identified 63 genes that were conserved in Moko strains and missing from brown rot strains. A large gene block included several genes of interest: the T3e ripAU, a two-component system involved in the stress response of cpxR and cpxA, multiple drug efflux pumps from the Acr and RND families, and an AraC-type transcriptional regulator. Several isolated transcriptional regulators, including one each from the TetR and MarR families, were also identified. Our analyses identified similar numbers of NPB-and brown rot-specific genes relative to Moko strains. Although NPB strains exhibited three specific genomic islands that may be related to adaptation (potentially acquired by HGT), brown rot strains exhibited more than one hundred specific genes encoding proteins of unknown function that appeared to be conserved in other bacteria. Although gene loss was globally more predominant in brown rot strains than in NPB strains, both ecotypes only lost a single distinct T3e each (ripAU and ripAA, respectively), possibly while diverging from their respective Moko lineages. These contrasting rates of gene loss between effectors relative to the rest of the genome suggest that the loss of these two effectors could have been key events in the emergence of these ecotypes. 
 HGT events between Moko lineages To test the hypothesis that adaptation to banana spread through Moko lineages of phylotype II via HGT, we searched for signs of transfer between Moko lineages using the AnGST algorithm. This algorithm compares gene trees with their associated species tree and infers both HGT events and the direction of transfer by identifying conflicts between the two. We only considered genes with HGT patterns involving all four Moko lineages and directions of transfers compatible with a unique original donor. According to our hypothesis, this unique donor would be pathogenic to banana (Additional file 2). This strategy identified nine genes. Five of these genes exhibited the IIA Moko lineages MRCA as the likely donor with the IIB Moko lineages as acceptors. Of these five genes, two encode the T3es ripAD and ripG4 from the GALA family. The others encode two hypothetical proteins and a bacteriophage-related protein. Three genes exhibited the IIB-3 lineage as the donor and putatively encode a protein belonging to the beta-lactamase superfamily, the translation initiation factor infA, and hrcT, a key component of the T3SS. The only gene that apparently exhibited the IIB-4 lineage as a donor encodes a putative adenine-specific methyl-transferase. This analysis suggests that a small minority of genes seems to have spread through every Moko lineage via a single lineage (the hypothetical original donor). Although the original donors were not fully consistent, more than half of the HGT events originally started from the IIA Moko's MRCA and affected T3es that are likely to be directly involved in pathogenesis. 
 Association of sequence polymorphisms with host-adaptation Due to the phylogenetic proximity of NPB and brown rot strains to individual Moko lineages, we analyzed the diversity of their shared genomic content. We analyzed multiple alignments of protein sequences to search for nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (NS-SNPs) and insertions and deletions (INDELs) associated with the host-adapted groups. We will refer to these features as host-adapted polymorphisms (HAPs). More precisely, we selected polymorphisms that exhibited the same form in Moko strains but a different form in either the NPB or brown rot strains (Additional file 4). Of the 2,855 genes common to the NPB and Moko strains, 96% were polymorphic. However, only 24 genes (<1%) contained HAPs, including 16 within conserved domains in protein sequences. This result can be explained by the very low divergence of the IIB4-NPB and IIB4 Moko lineages, as only 14% of their common genes are polymorphic. Notable NS-SNPs were identified in the T3e ripAN and in a PadR-like transcription regulator involved in the response to phenolic compounds; notable INDELS were identified in motB, a flagellar motor protein involved in the response to chemotaxis signals, and epsF, a membrane protein involved in the secretion of EPS. NS-SNPs were also identified in two multidrug resistance proteins (MDRs) and an HTH-type transcriptional regulator. Ninety-nine percent of the 2459 common genes present in both the brown rot and Moko strains were polymorphic. Of these, 1024 genes (42%) contained HAPs, including 742 within protein domains. Twenty T3es contained the majority of NS-SNPs, including five T3es with more than ten NS-SNPs (ripV1, ripG6, ripC1, ripAO and ripAD), three members of the GALA T3e family and ripAB and ripAC. Two regulators and subunits of the T3SS were polymorphic: prhJ and hrpAFGHJ. Several HAPs were found in genes encoding members of diverse metabolic pathways, notably the NorB and NasF enzymes of inorganic nitrogen metabolism. Finally, 22 putative transcriptional regulators of various families contained HAPs in their substrate-binding domains. 
 Discussion Using comparative genomic analysis, we compared the genomes of three host-adapted groups of strains from the phylotype II of R. solanacearum: brown rot strains adapted to potatoes and temperate climates, Moko strains adapted to bananas, and NPB strains adapted to melon or Anthurium. Together, our analyses demonstrated that the potato brown rot, Moko, and NPB strains constitute phylogenetically related populations that have adapted to biologically distinct host environmental conditions. Thus, these phylotype II groups, called ecotypes, provided a good model to explore host adaptation in R. solanacearum. We hypothesized that comparing the genomes of these closely related but biologically distinct groups could identify specific mechanisms of host adaptation. Overall, the species complex appeared to be very dynamic, with a large pan-genome and a limited core genome. Specifically, the R. solanacearum T3e repertoire was unusually large compared with those of other well-known plant pathogens such as Pseudomonas spp. or Xanthomonas spp.  [24, 25] . The variability of T3es suggests that there may be extensive functional redundancy between effectors. Paralog families, such as the GALA effectors, are known to exhibit functional redundancies, and single effector mutations rarely produce a virulence defect  [10] . These functional redundancies drastically reduce the analytic power of comparative genomics; therefore, more data about the specific virulence functions of individual T3es are needed to better understand the biological mechanisms underlying host adaptation. Such data are especially important considering that among the few functionally characterized T3es  [26] , only ripR (popS) is a member of the R. solanacearum core effectome. Three competing hypotheses could explain the origin of polyphyly of the Moko strains. The first hypothesis proposes that the phylotype II MRCA was a banana pathogen and that the capacity to infect banana was subsequently lost in multiple clades after clonal expansion due to variations in environmental selection pressures. Our analyses did not identify any genes present in all Moko strains but absent in all other R. solanacearum strains. Although this observation seems to contradict our hypothesis, it does not invalidate the hypothesis but rather suggests that different parts of the set of hypothetical genes responsible for the banana virulent phenotype present in phylotype II's MRCA could have been lost in non-Moko lineages. This phenomenon would have contributed to the mosaic nature of R. solanacearum genomes and would have been facilitated by functional redundancies. Our second hypothesis states that banana pathogenicity emerged in a single clade and spread among phylotype II strains by HGT facilitated by natural transformation. Despite the large gene pool shared by Moko strains, only nine genes exhibited HGT patterns consistent with our hypothesis. We determined that the T3e ripAD that was transferred from the common ancestor of the IIA-6/24 Moko lineages to the IIB-3/4 Moko lineages. This effector does not possess the regulatory hrp II box motif but is expressed in an hrpB-dependent manner and is translocated into plant cells  [27] . Moreover, although its function is not characterized in R. solanacearum, it is also a member of the hpx8 family found in plant pathogenic Xanthomonas. Another T3e, ripG4, exhibited similar HGT patterns originating from the IIA Moko lineages. This effector is a divergent member of the GALA family that interferes with PAMP-triggered immunity in Arabidopsis and contributes to host adaptation  [10] . A genomic content analysis was designed to characterize the evolution of genomic content during the emergence of the NPB and brown rot clades and to identify the specific genes that could be responsible for host range differences. Our analysis revealed that few genes separate the Moko strains from the NPB and brown rot strains despite their biologically distinct phenotypes. One of these, ripAA, was lost by NPB strains' MRCA during its divergence from the IIB-4 Moko lineage. This effector is recognized by tobacco, so it prevents phylotype I strain GMI1000 from infecting tobacco plants  [8] . We speculate that ripAA could either be an effector that enables Moko strains to wilt banana or an avirulence factor that prevents pathogenicity in plants that are not part of the Moko strains' host range but are part of the NPB strains' host range. ripAA is a common effector in the species complex, but none of the strains with this effector are melon or Anthurium pathogens. Therefore, we propose that the loss of this effector by the NPB strains could have been a key event in this clade's host change. Similarly, ripAU was lost by the brown rot strains during the divergence from the IIB3 Moko lineage. This effector is also present in all of the other strains of the species complex, and its loss might have been necessary for brown rot strains to adapt to temperate climates. The cold tolerance of brown rot strains is strictly dependent on an interaction with the host  [28] , and T3es may play key roles in this interaction. Although the function of ripAU in R. solanacearum is unknown, this effector belongs to the hpx8 family. Hpx families are T3e families sharing protein sequence similarities defined by Mukaihara, and the hpx8 family shares similarities with the effector XopV, which is found in various plant pathogenic Xanthomonas  [27] . However, the function of XopV in Xanthomonas is not well characterized. A complete T1SS was acquired by NPB strains during their divergence from banana-infecting sequevar 4 Moko strains, most likely via HGT. T1SSs are ubiquitous and versatile systems often involved in the secretion of various virulence factors into the extracellular medium, such as proteases, toxins, or quorum-sensing molecules that can promote plant invasion  [29] . T1SSs can also play a defensive role to counteract plant defense responses by exporting antimicrobial compounds out of the cell. Numerous genes encoding conserved proteins of unknown function were acquired by brown rot strains during their divergence from sequevar 3 Moko strains. Homologs of most of these genes are present in other soil-borne and plant pathogenic bacteria, suggesting that they may play a role in adaptation to either environmental conditions or unique hosts. Further characterization of these proteins of unknown function is required to determine if they participate in brown rot strain adaptation to temperate climate. Homologs of the transporter and the sensor of the iron-sensing fec system and a sigma70 factor were also encoded by brown rot-specific genes. The fec system is responsible for iron uptake and is essential in many human pathogens and a few enteric plant pathogens  [30, 31] . However, all R. solanacearum strains sequenced to date have the fur system, which depends on another siderophore. It is possible that this fec system has a ligand specificity that is more efficient at sequestering iron in potato tubers or at low temperatures. Functional analyses could determine if this additional iron uptake system is involved in brown rot cold tolerance. Finally, we looked for polymorphisms (i.e., HAPs) that could affect the function of the genes shared between Moko and either NPB or brown rot strains. Polymorphisms are introduced by replication errors or intragenic recombination and can have a major impact on gene functionality. In plant pathogens, a single amino acid modification in TAL effectors can alter the host gene targeted by the effector  [32] . Despite the genetic distances between Moko lineages and their proximity to the brown rot and NPB ecotypes, a high number of genes contained sites that were coincidentally fixed in the Moko strains but polymorphic in either NPB or brown rot strains, suggesting that these sites are functionally important and may be related to host adaptation. NPB and Moko strains contained several HAPs in known virulence factors. The T3e ripAN had a single NS-SNP. Although RipAN is translocated into host cells  [33] , this effector's function in R. solanacearum is unknown. Homologs of ripAN have not been identified in other plant pathogenic bacteria. One HAP was also found in the gene encoding the inner membrane protein EpsF, which is predicted to be responsible for the modification and/or export of the exopolysaccharide EPS I, a major bacterial wilt virulence factor. A six-amino acid insertion was identified in the C-terminal end of the NPB epsF gene. The extent of cross-talk between plants and EPS is not yet entirely understood, but it is known that different EPS proteins trigger different plant defense responses and that EPS modifications play a role in biofilm formation, immune evasion and virulence in EPSproducing bacteria  [34, 35] . Furthermore, we also found a HAP in a transcriptional regulator containing a PadR-like domain. PadR domains modulate the expression of virulence factors, MDR efflux pumps and responses to phenolic stress  [36, 37] . Interestingly, HAPs were also identified in two independent MDR transporters. Because plants produce antimicrobial phenolic compounds in response to pathogens, the PadR and MDR genes might constitute a network for stress response/resistance to plant defense mechanisms adapted to NPB-specific host range. Altogether, the 24 HAPs identified may be necessary for NPB strains to adapt to the environmental conditions encountered in new hosts. The brown rot and Moko strains exhibited hundreds of genes with HAPSs in conserved protein domains, suggesting that R. solanacearum metabolism and virulence may function differently in brown rot strains. Remarkably, the list of HAP sites included central virulence regulators, T3SS regulators, T3SS machinery, and 19 T3es. T3es with HAPs notably included an effector with a nuclear localization signal (ripAB) and several functionally redundant effectors known to affect host range (ripG2, ripG3, and ripG6)  [10, 38] . Recent transcriptomic studies suggest that regulation of virulence factors during pathogenesis is far more complex than previous models proposed  [39, 40] . Given that brown rot's adaptation to cold is dependent on interactions with a host, a large reorganization of core mechanisms may be required for R. solanacearum to cause disease in temperate climates. 
 Conclusions This extensive comparative genomics analysis identified relatively few differences in gene content between closely related R. solanacearum strains with contrasting biological characteristics. However, several T3e were associated with the Moko, NPB and brown rot ecotypes (  Table 2 ). Most differences between strains involved HAPs of uncertain biological significance, although many HAPs were located in genes associated with bacterial wilt virulence. Our study did identify specific hypotheses concerning mechanisms of host adaptation in the R. solanacearum species complex. These hypotheses  Table 2  Candidate T3e for host specificity identified in Moko, NPB and brown rot ecotypes will be tested using functional genomics experiments such as gene swaps and deletions to determine whether these mechanisms play roles in host specificity. However, an important proportion of these candidate genes are related to regulatory function, suggesting that host range could evolve through changes in regulation. Small genomic differences could lead to drastically different expression profiles when the bacterium infects different hosts. Due to their unexpected overall genomic similarity and their clear-cut differences in host range, IIB-4 Moko and NPB form an elegant model for transcriptomic studies designed to identify differentially expressed genes associated with host specificity. 
 Methods 
 Genome sequencing and assembly Total DNA was extracted using the phenol-chloroform method. Libraries were constructed using Nextera technology and sequenced on Illumina's HiSeq-2000 using a 2 × 50-nt paired-end strategy. Reads were pre-processed using Trimmomatic  [41] . First, adapter sequences and low-quality nucleotides occurring at 5' and 3' ends with a Phred quality score < 20 were trimmed. Second, reads shorter than half their initial lengths were discarded. The resulting reads were assembled using Velvet  [42] . Manual editing of the annotations was performed for genes of interest using the MaGe web interface of the MicroScope platform  [43] .   (30 plants)  and the ornamental plant Anthurium cv. Fire (4 plants). Plants were placed in a full containment security level growth chamber with a 12-h photoperiod, 28 ± 2°C (day) and 24 ± 2°C (night), and 90% relative humidity. Bacterial suspensions were prepared as described in Cellier & Prior 2010. Using the soil-soak method, each plant was inoculated with 5x10 9 colony-forming units (CFU) after lightly damaging the roots with a scalpel. Strains were considered pathogenic if more than 50% of plants presented wilt symptoms within one month after inoculation. Each assay was repeated 2 times. We could not analyze the phenotype of strain Po82 because the authors of this published genome would not share their strains  [44] . 
 Exploratory virulence dataset The list of R. solanacearum virulence factors analyzed in this study was based on Remenant et al.  [12] . Orthology relationships were determined for each strain by BLAST and synteny data using the web-based MaGe interface. Every gene annotation was then manually validated to ensure homogeneity of the start codon positions and to detect frameshifts and pseudogenization. T3es were annotated using the IANT ""Ralstonia T3E"" database  [13] . T3es located on contig borders were considered as present to establish the core effectome. 
 Species complex phylogeny The species complex phylogeny was inferred by neighbor-joining using MUMi genomic distances  [20] . MUMi values were computed from whole-genome comparisons conducted with MUMMer 3.0  [45] . 
 Phyletic profiles Homology relationships across all genomes analyzed in this study were inferred using the Orthologous MAtrix algorithm (OMA)  [46]  with the following default criteria: alignment length > 60% of the minimum gene length and alignment score > 181 in Gonnet PAM matrix units. Phyletic profiles  [47]  were subsequently determined using R to identify co-occurrence patterns for specific genes in a given group of strains. The specific gene content was locally blasted on the NCBI nr database to identify an eventual source organism. 
 Detection of gain, loss and HGT events Amino acid sequences of each homolog family were aligned with Muscle  [48] , and a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree supported by 1000 bootstrap replicates was computed with FastTree  [49] . Gain, loss, and HGT events were inferred by reconciliation of the gene trees and the species complex tree topologies using the AnGST algorithm (Analyzer of Gene and Species Tree)  [50] . This algorithm compares the topology of a gene tree with its associated species tree, which is generally defined as an explicit phylogenetic method within the scope of HGT detection. The algorithm identifies differences between the gene and the species trees and explains them (""reconciles"") according to a set of evolutionary events, including gain, loss, duplication or horizontal transfer, inferred with a parsimony-based model. Loci with > 95% nucleotide identity were discarded to avoid false positives caused by phylogenetic trees with insufficient resolution. 
 Allelic variation analysis Nucleic and protein sequences of each homolog family were aligned with Muscle  [48] . The resulting alignments were trimmed on the 5' ends and then screened for host-associated amino-acid polymorphisms using R. The strain MolK2 was used as a reference to assign the position of each polymorphism in the sequence. Functional domains containing polymorphisms were identified using the CDD database from NCBI.

While there is no universally-accepted definition of 'smallholder farmers'  (Morton, 2007) , most cultivate small areas of land (usually less than 10 ha, often less than 2 ha), use family labor, and depend on their farms as their main source of both food security and income generation  (Cornish, 1998; Nagayets, 2005) . It is estimated that smallholder farmers represent 85% of the world's farms  (Nagayets, 2005)  and provide more than 80% of the food consumed in the developing world  (IFAD, 2013) . They also occupy a significant portion of the world's farmland ranging from 62% in Africa to 85% in Asia  (FAO, 2014) . What happens to smallholder farmers in the futureas the climate changeswill therefore have significant social, economic and environmental consequences globally. Across the world, smallholder farmers are considered to be disproportionately vulnerable to climate change because changes in temperature, rainfall and the frequency or intensity of extreme weather events directly affect their crop and animal productivity as well as their household's food security, income and well-being. While in some cases, climate change may increase the productivity of certain crops (e.g.,  Rosenzweig et al., 2002; Tubiello and Fischer, 2007; Fuhrer and Gregory, 2014; Schultz and Jones, 2010) , a growing number of studies show that the productivity of many crops (e.g., maize, rice, sorghum, cassava) and livestock that smallholder farmers in developing countries raise are expected to be significantly reduced in the coming decades due to increased climate variability and climate change, among other factors  (Godfray et al., 2010; van Noordwijk et al., 2011) . Most smallholder farmers, especially in developing countries, have limited capacity to adapt to climate change, given their low education levels, low income, limited land areas, and poor access to technical assistance, market and credits, and often chronic dependence on external support  (Morton, 2007; Harvey et al., 2014) . In addition, in many regions, smallholder farmers farm on marginal lands (e.g., steep hillside slopes, poor soils or areas prone to flooding or water scarcity) and are therefore highly vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events that can cause landslides, flooding, droughts or other problems. Moreover, many smallholders in developing countries live in highly remote areas with low-quality infrastructure that further hampers their access to markets, financial assistance, disaster relief, technical assistance or government support . As a result, although many smallholder farmers have been facing adverse climatic events and, in most cases taking corresponding action  (Altieri and Koohafkan, 2008) , most are ill-prepared for the challenge of adapting to the increased frequency and/or intensity of extreme climate events that are expected with climate change. In light of both the observed and expected impacts of climate change on smallholder farmers, many governments, NGO's and multilateral organizations are now actively promoting initiatives to help smallholder farmers adapt to climate change  (FAO, 2013) . Most of those initiatives aim at strengthening and/or expanding four main types of activities that are deemed to improve the capacity of smallholders to manage climate risks, namely: (i) developing new technologies, such as satellite-based early warning systems, (ii) facilitating government support (subsidies, insurance, technical assistance, etc.), (iii) assisting farmers in accessing credit, capital and risk-insurance, and/or (iv) adapting farm management practices  (Smit and Skinner, 2002; Howden et al., 2007) . While all of these activities are useful and necessary, the first three are often difficult to implement in the short-term due to time required for and external support needed to put in place the necessary enabling conditions such as appropriate policies, governance structures, economic incentives and infrastructure. An immediate and direct way to help smallholder farmers ensure their farm-based livelihoods in the face of the increasing stresses posed by climate variability is to focus on helping them use farm management practices based on agrobiodiversity and ecosystem services that provide adaptation benefits  (van Noordwijk et al., 2011) . There is a wide array of agricultural practices that could help farmers improve their farming systems and increase the resiliency of their systems to climate change  (Wezel et al., 2014) . Many smallholder farmers are already implementing practices that maintain complex agrobiodiversity and that result in a higher capacity of their production units to resist, cope with and/or recover from extreme climatic events  (Lin, 2007; Altieri and Koohafkan, 2008) . Some of the most promising adaptation practices take advantage of existing ecological processes and biological diversity to provide adaptation benefits to agricultural producers and can be potentially incorporated in many of the increasing number of initiatives that are promoting ecosystem-based responses to climate change and variability. While several authors  (Altieri and Koohafkan, 2008; Munang et al., 2013)  and international organizations  (SCBD, 2009; FAO, 2013; UNFCCC, 2013)  have highlighted the general importance and benefits of ecosystembased strategies for climate change adaptation, there have been no studies that have defined what 'Ecosystem-based Adaptation' (EbA) means in the context of agriculture and used this definition to identify which such practices are already in place. In addition, there have been no studies that have examined the associated benefits and costs of EbA practices for smallholders, or considered which processes are currently promoting or hampering the adoption of these practices. The objective of this paper is to provide a framework for identifying which agricultural practices can be considered Ecosystem-based Adaptation and to explore which of these practices are suitable for smallholder farmers. We demonstrate the application of the framework using examples of practices used by smallholder coffee farmers in Central America. We also explore the opportunities and constraints for enhancing the use of EbA by smallholder farmers and provide recommendations for how EbA could be scaled up across smallholder farming systems globally. Identifying ecosystem-based practices which can both help farmers to adapt to climate change and also conserve the agroecosystems' capacity to provide both on-and off-site ecosystem services is important, not only because of the expected increase of negative impacts of climate change-on smallholder farmers, but also because of the increasing pressure that will come from the rapidly growing human population on both provisioning (e.g., food, fiber) and non-provisioning (e.g., water and nutrient cycles) services in agricultural landscapes  (Tilman et al., 2002; Jackson et al., 2007) . 2. What are EbA practices and which are potentially appropriate for smallholders' farming systems? Ecosystem-based adaptation has generally been defined as the use of biodiversity and ecosystem services as part of an overall adaptation strategy to help people adapt to the adverse effects of climate change  (SCBD, 2009) . While there is a rapidly growing interest in Ecosystem-based Adaptation for its potential social, environmental and economic benefits (e.g.,  Jones et al., 2012; Munang et al., 2013; Campos et al., 2014; Doswald et al., 2014) , almost all of this literature has focused on the adaptation benefits that accrue from the conservation and/or restoration of natural habitats. We refer to Ecosystem-based Adaptation in agricultural systems as the implementation of agricultural management practices that use or take advantage of biodiversity, ecosystem services or ecological processes (either at the plot, farm or landscape level) to help increase the ability of crops or livestock to adapt to climate variability. In this respect, adaptation can be seen as a process to promote the maintenance or further adoption of ecologically-based management practices that can provide adaptation benefits. Under this definition, adaptation can be seen both as the process of using ecologically-based management practices that provide adaptation benefits, as well as a characteristic of diverse agroecosystems that are based on the use of biodiversity and ecosystem services and which are resilient to the impacts of climate change  (Jackson et al., 2010) . We argue, along with other authors  (Altieri and Koohafkan, 2008; Harvey et al., 2013; Lavorel et al., 2015) , that the use of ecosystem-based management practices in agricultural systems and landscapes can help smallholder farmers adapt to climate change by providing both on-site (e.g., farm level) and off-site (e.g., landscape level) benefits. Agriculture depends on ecosystem services (such as pollination, nutrient cycling, pest control,  Swift et al., 2004; Barrios, 2007) , but also serves as an important source of ecosystem services to people  (Tscharntke et al., 2005; Swinton et al., 2007) . Ecosystem-based management practices that focus on conservation, restoration and sustainable management of biodiversity and ecosystem services could therefore potentially help farmers adapt both to climate change in the long term (i.e., by ensuring the continued provision of on and off-site ecosystem services) as well as to climate variability in the short term (i.e., by improving the resilience of production units to the increasing impacts of extreme weather events;  Howden et al., 2007; Altieri and Koohafkan, 2008) . Many smallholders are already implementing ecosystem-based practices that are already helping them adapt to climate extremes (e.g.,  Holt-Giménez, 2002; Lin, 2007) , however there is a tendency for development-oriented initiatives to promote technological packages that simplify these smallholder farmers systems, making them more vulnerable to market and/or climate-variability stresses  (Eakin, 2005) . The promotion of practices that are ecosystem-based could help reverse this trend and promote farming systems that are more ecologically and socially sustainable, and resilient to climate change (van  Noordwijk et al., 2011) . We define Ecosystem-based Adaptation in agricultural systems as agricultural management practices which use or take advantage of biodiversity or ecosystem services or processes (either at the plot, farm or landscape level) to help increase the ability of crops or livestock to adapt to climate change and variability. Under this definition ecosystem-based agricultural practices must be based on the conservation, restoration or management of biodiversity (at the genetic, species or ecosystem level) and ecosystem processes and services (such as nutrient cycling, water regulation). Examples of agricultural practices that meet these criteria include practices that use both agro-biodiversity and ecosystem processes include the management of trees in agroforestry or silvopastoral systems, the use of mulching or local species as cover crops to help conserve soil structure, humidity and nutrients, or the conservation of riparian vegetation in farms to ensure water provision, among others. In contrast,practices that substitute the role of biodiversity in providing ecosystem functions and services for agricultural production such as inorganic fertilization, or application of fungicides are not ecosystem-based. Second, EbA practices are practices which have been proven to improve the ability of crops and livestock to adapt to climate change and variability. These practices can be implemented at various scales-from plot to farm to landscape. For example, onfarm management of genetic biodiversity (e.g., diversification of crop varieties or inclusion of wild relatives) can ensure a broader source of crop resistance-capacity to uncertain occurrence and effects of extreme weather events  (Lewis et al., 1997; Jackson et al., 2010; Ratnadass et al., 2012) . Other farm-level practices include the use of integrated pest-management strategies (i.e. the integration of cultural, biological, and chemical control methods), or new cropping systems to reduce the impacts of pests and diseases  (Way and van Emden, 2000; Lamichhane et al., 2015) , the planting of windbreaks, agroforestry systems or cover crops to help reduce the evapotranspiration effect of extreme radiation and/or wind, or the energetic force of extreme rainfall and strong winds on soil structure (e.g.,  Lin, 2007; Altieri and Koohafkan, 2008) , among others. At the landscape level, EbA practices can include those that use biodiversity and ecological processes to help regulate water and nutrient cycling (e.g., by ensuring tree cover or  Table 1  Summary of three key dimensions and underlying criteria that agricultural practices need to satisfy to be considered Ecosystem-based Adaptation practices that are appropriate for smallholder farmers. Practices that fulfill at least one criterion in the 'ecosystem-based' and 'adaptation benefits' dimensions can be considered 'Ecosystembased Adaptation practices. Practices that also fulfill at least one criterion in the third dimension are EbA practices appropriate for smallholder farmers. Requires implementation costs and labor affordable to smallholder farmers natural vegetation in key hydrological hotspots), or to reduce the incidence or severity of crop pest and disease outbreaks related to extreme weather events (e.g., by enhancing the structural complexity of the agricultural landscapes through diverse cropping systems, or inclusion of natural vegetation and on-farm tree cover to promote pest regulation;  Jackson et al., 2010; Juroszek and von Tiedemann, 2011; Pautasso et al., 2012; Jaramillo et al., 2013) . Practices that meet at least one of the criteria (see  Table 1 ) in each of these two dimensions (i.e., those that are ecosystem-based, and those that provide adaptation benefits) can be considered to be Ecosystem-based Adaptation practices. However, in order for an EbA practice to be considered appropriate or useful for smallholder farmers it must also help improve their livelihoods and take into account their socioeconomic realities. There is ample evidence that diverse agroforestry systems can increase the food security of smallholder farmers and households, and increase or diversify their sources of income generation  (Sanchez, 2000; Altieri and Nicholls, 2008) . Ecosystembased Adaptation practices often take advantage of local or traditional knowledge, and can therefore be easily used by smallholder farmers. In addition, these practices typically are based on local, available and renewable inputs, such as using local materials from the farm or the landscape. Last, but not least, they should be practices that have low implementation costs and labor needs, which smallholder farmers can meet, and not increase farmer dependence on external production inputs (i.e., machinery, fertilizers, labor, etc.)  (Munang et al., 2014) . In summary, in our proposed framework, if a given agricultural practices meets at least one criteria in each of the 'ecosystembased' and the 'adaptation benefits' dimensions, it can be considered an Ecosystem-based Adaptation practice. If it meets at least one criterion in all three dimensions (ecosystem-based, adaptation, and livelihoods), it can be considered an Ecosystembased Adaptation practice that is appropriate for smallholder farmers. 
 An application of this definition to practices used in smallholder coffee systems To demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed framework for identifying EbA practices for smallholder farmers, we applied it to agricultural practices used in smallholder coffee production system, a common farming system in much of tropical America  (Jha et al., 2014) . Using information from a related extensive literature review (n > 300 papers) on practices used by small scale coffee combined with elicitation of expert opinion (Bautista-Solís et al., 2014), we identified the key practices used in smallholder coffee production and then evaluated each practice against the proposed criteria in  Table 1  to identify which practices can be considered 'EbA' practices and which of these are suitable for smallholder farmers. In Annex 1 we provide the detailed information on the evidence that was used for evaluating each practice against the proposed criteria, including the full bibliography of the literature reviewed. Here, we present a higher-level summary of this information to illustrate how the different practices meet different criteria. Supplementary material related to this article found, in the online version, at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2015.05.013. Of the 16 coffee management practices evaluated, nine can be considered Ecosystem-based Adaptation practices, as they clearly are based on the conservation, restoration or management of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and confer adaptive benefits (Annex 1). On the other hand, some practices are clearly not ecosystem-based (e.g., irrigation systems, use of inorganic fertilizers and pesticides, genetically modified varieties, relocation of crops, drainage channels), while two (resistant varieties and mulches) fall into a gray zone with their classification depending on exactly how these practices are implemented. Of the nine EbA practices identified, six can be considered to be appropriate for smallholder farmers, due to their ability to help improve family food security, diversity income generation, or their ease of adoption by smallholder farmers with limited resources. One EbA adaptation practice that stands out as particularly promising for smallholder farmers is the use of shade trees (i.e., producing coffee as an agroforestry system), as this practice can help ensure the continued provision of key ecosystem services (pollination, natural pest control, conservation of water and soils, etc.), buffers coffee from extreme temperatures and rainfall, ensures more stable production under climate-related stresses  (Lin, 2007; Philpott et al., 2008) , and provides clear socioeconomic benefits to smallholder farmers  (Jha et al., 2014) . However, this practice often results in lower yields in normal years  (Lopez-Bravo et al., 2012) , and has variable impacts on different pests and diseases  (Avelino et al., 2011; Lopez-Bravo et al., 2012) . It also requires significant knowledge, technical skills and labor for site-specific management of shade  (Avelino et al., 2011; Ratnadass et al., 2012) . Our framework appears to do a good job of identifying existing practices which can be considered 'Ecosystem-based Adaptation'. It also permits the identification of EbA practices for smallholder farmers, although the lack of readily available information about some of the socioeconomic impacts of these practices and the huge variability in smallholder farming contexts makes this dimension somewhat harder to quantify. Nonetheless, we propose that the framework is a useful starting point for identifying EbA options and could be applied to the wide variety of agricultural systems that exist globally, and could at least stimulate careful consideration of which of these practices are suitable for smallholder farmers. 
 Benefits and constraints of EbA practices for smallholders Ecosystem-based Adaptation practices can potentially benefit smallholders in multiple ways beyond helping them adapt to climate change. The most obvious benefits of EbA practices are that they help ensure the continued provision of key ecosystem services (water provision, food provision, nutrient regulation, pest control, pollination) on which farming depends  (Lavorel et al., 2015)  This is in contrast to other (non-EbA) adaptation measures, such as the construction of dams for water irrigation or the increased use of agrochemicals, which also confer adaptation benefits but may negatively impact the provision of ecosystem services, while also having additional negative environmental offsite effects (e.g., loss of biodiversity or contamination of streams,  Graymore et al., 2001; Battaglin et al., 2003; Carabias-Martinez et al., 2003)  and socioeconomic impacts (such as negative impacts on health,  Wesseling et al., 1997) . In addition, the use of EbA practices can help diversify production systems and sources of income generation, providing more stability to smallholder farmers  (Munang et al., 2014) . For example, the use of agroforestry in coffee, cocoa or cattle production systems can diversify revenue by providing timber, fruits, fuelwood and building materials (e.g.,  Lagemann and Heuveldop, 1983; Somarriba et al., 2004; Herzog, 1994; Rice, 2008 ) that farmers can use for additional income, especially in years when income from the main cash crop is reduced  (Jha et al., 2011) . These additional products reduce farmer vulnerability to market changes  (Jha et al., 2011)  as well as their dependence on outside products  (Toledo and Moguel, 2012) , thus helping improve farmer food security directly and indirectly. The use of agroforestry practices can also make significant contributions to biodiversity conservation efforts  (Harvey et al., 2008; Jha et al., 2014) . In addition, many EbA practices can help mitigate climate change by either reducing the amount of GHG emitted from agricultural systems (e.g., by reducing the use of inorganic fertilizers, agrochemicals, machinery and associated emissions), or by increasing the overall farm biomass (e.g., by increasing soil carbon stocks or above-ground biomass;  Doswald and Osti, 2011; Harvey et al., 2014) . Overall, the co-benefits of EbA practices in terms of climate regulation, water purification, habitat creation, biodiversity conservation and landscape amenities are often significantly greater than those of engineering alternatives (e.g., flood defenses infrastructure, water treatment plants)  (Naumann et al., 2013) . However, there are also some key limitations to EbA practices which can hamper their adoption by smallholder farmers, especially in developing countries. Some of these practices (e.g. using cover crops) can require farmers to make difficult trade-offs between the adaptation benefits they can provide in the longer term and the significant labor investment needed for their establishment (in the short term) or their maintenance  (Jha et al., 2014) . Another potential limitation is that some EbA practices (e.g., some IPM practices for Maize are based on external technical assistance;  Wyckhuys and O'Neil, 2007)  require information or knowledge that is not available to producers in marginal areas where technical assistance is limited or inexistent  (Anderson and Feder, 2004) . For example, practices that use complex pest management strategies such as the push-pull system (a system based on a combination of repellent and trap plants to eliminate insect pests) have been proven to improve harvests and control maize stem-borer in Eastern Africa using locally-available plant species but require significant technical assistance and multistakeholder engagement  (Khan et al., 2011) . 
 What is needed to scale up the use of EbA practices in smallholder farming systems? In order for EbA to be scaled up, it is important to promote the adoption of EbA in appropriate farming systems and contexts, to encourage the continued use of these approaches in areas where farmers are already using EbA approaches, and also to reduce the on-going loss of biodiversity and ecological integrity within farming systems. We suggest three ways in which the use of EbA practices by smallholder farmers can be promoted and scaled up to help expand their adoption or, where they are already in place, stop on-going trends in simplifying biodiversity resources of smallholder farming systems. First, we need to improve our understanding and scientific evidence of the long-term effectiveness of different EbA practices in enhancing the resilience of crops, livestock and farming systems in the face of climate change and extreme weather events, either individually or in combination with other practices  (FAO, 2013) . There are still limited studies that explicitly compare the relative performance and cost-effectiveness of EbA vs non-EbA options (an exception is  Jones et al., 2012)  under different climate-related stresses and agricultural systems. In addition, more information is needed on which EbA options are most appropriate for smallholder farmers living in different socioeconomic and agroecological contexts, as the relative merits and drawbacks of individual practices are likely to be highly context-dependent. Second, we need better articulation of agricultural and climate change policies to promote incentives or actions that, while achieving production targets, also help maintain the ability of agroecosystems to provide on-and off-site ecosystem services and help improve farmer livelihoods in the face of climate change. Indeed, smallholder farmers are likely to maintain EbA practices (or adopt them if not already in place) if they perceive that these practices will help them achieve their production goals even under the impact of climate change, or if they receive direct incentives (e.g., payment for ecosystem services) for their implementation. More specifically, governments and development organizations could promote greater use of EbA through a mix of policies, incentives, training, capacity-building, and technical support, so that smallholder farmers have both the necessary resources and the required knowledge to make informed decisions about how to adopt and effectively use EbA practices to enhance the overall resiliency of their farm. Recent efforts, such as those of the Colombian government whose Second Communication to UNFCCC explicitly includes EbA activities in agroecosystems  (Cabrera-Leal et al., 2010)  and the South African Expanded Public Works Programme  (Midgley et al., 2012)  that promotes the rehabilitation and restoration of ecosystems as a means of reducing environmental and social vulnerability of communities (including smallholder farmers) to climate change, are important steps in this direction. At the same time, governments should carefully revisit existing policies that, at the farm level, are currently undermining the maintenance or adoption of ecosystem-based approaches such as ongoing subsidies that promote the simplification of agro-ecosystems and the increased use of agrochemicals and fossil fuel  (Altieri and Koohafkan, 2008) . Similarly, governments should also revisit policies that, at the landscape level, downplay the role of agro-ecosystems to focus only on the use of hard infrastructure (e.g., dams, sea walls, roads) to reduce the impacts of extreme climatic events  (Pramova et al., 2012) . Third, it is important that governments strengthen and provide ongoing support to agricultural extension programs, farmer field schools, agricultural technical programs and universities, and ensure that their curricula and outreach activities include the promotion of EbA practices. Globally, many countries have dismantled or significant reduced their extension programs  (Chang, 2009 ), yet the need for such support (especially for smallholder farmers facing the impacts of climate change) is greater than ever  (Porter et al., 2014) . Farmer field schools and effective extension programs are needed to foster information exchange on EbA practices from technical institutions to producers and viceversa as well as among smallholders  (Braun and Duveskog, 2011; Vignola et al., 2010) . Greater investment in extension services is urgently needed to ensure that smallholder farmers have access to best available information on adaption strategies and can make informed decisions about their farming systems and actually increase adoption rates of EbA practices  (Vignola et al., 2010) . In addition, innovative alliances (e.g., among farmers, NGOs, governments, scientists and the private sector) could play a valuable role in filling the extension services gaps and helping to promote appropriate EbA practices  (Munang et al., 2014) . 
 Conclusions The use of Ecosystem-based Adaptation practices in agriculture offers an important opportunity to help smallholder farmers adapt to climate change, while providing important livelihood and environmental co-benefits. Our framework is designed to help identify which agricultural practices could be considered EbA and which of these practices may be appropriate for smallholder farming systems. Many of the practices that can be considered EbA (e.g., agroforestry practices, soil and water conservation practices, etc.) are already well known and have been proven to help smallholder farmers adapt to climate change, but current financial, political and technical constraints limit a more widespread adoption of these practices among smallholder farmers. For those challenges to be overcome, it is critical that policy makers at all levels (local, national and international) recognize and promote the use of EbA approaches in agricultural development, climate change and environmental strategies, and support their widespread adoption. Key strategies for promoting EbA include (i) improving our understanding on the effectiveness of different EbA practices and of what factors drive their adoption, (ii) developing supportive and integrated agriculture and climate change policies that specifically promote EbA options as part of a broader adaptation program; and (iii) establishing and maintaining strong and innovative extension programs for smallholder farmers. 1 . 1 Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 127 2.

Accurate estimates of aboveground biomass (AGB) for tropical forests are needed to assess the spatial and temporal variation of these carbon stocks  (Houghton et al., 2001) . The AGB estimations have direct applications to forest management in light of the recent developments in the carbon market and REDD+  (IPCC, 2000; Gibbs et al., 2007) . Though considerable plot measurements are occurring, models used to predict biomass are often rough and need further improvements to lower biases and uncertainties  (Houghton et al., 2001; Chave et al., 2005) . Today, AGB spatial extrapolation methods mostly rely on remote sensing data  (Asner et al., 2010; Saatchi et al., 2011; Baccini et al., 2012) . While very promising, these methods still require calibration points from wellknown forest plot inventories  (Lucas et al., 2002) . Forest census plots typically consist of various measurements of properties of all the individual trees encountered on a given surface. The diameters at breast height (DBH) are always measured, generally starting at 10 cm. Depending on the inventory effort, additional information such as a tree's height or species may be recorded. The AGB of a forest plot is the sum of the AGB of the trees belonging to this plot. Tree AGB models use biological variables describing a tree to predict its individual AGB  (Brown et al., 1989; Brown, 1997; Araujo et al., 1999) . The widely used models use the tree DBH, the tree height, and the tree wood density, or wood specific gravity (WSG), to predict the tree's biomass  (Chave et al., 2005) . Among these variables, the DBH is measured in the field, and the effect of WSG on the plot AGB estimation is unclear for some authors  (Molto et al., 2012) . Thus, for AGB prediction, tree height is a key variable that is generally not measured. Therefore, it must be predicted. In boreal forests, classical height models predict a tree height from its DBH for a given species  (Sharma and Parton, 2007) . However, the biodiversity of tropical regions prevents the use of height models that include a species effect. In the past, various large-scale height-DBH model shapes have been proposed  (Huang et al., 1992) , but their applications to largescale tropical forests are rare  (Brown et al., 1989; Feldpausch et al., 2011) . The general objective of this paper is to explore the possibility of including additional information, such as forest stand structure structure and environmental variables, into the height-DBH model in order to build a flexible model that can be used for AGB estimations in different landscape contexts. We used a data set from French Guiana consisting of 42 forest plots. These plot inventories are suitable for AGB assessments  (IPCC, 2000) . Measures include the tree's DBH measured above 10 cm, height, and species. The plots are situated in the northern part of French Guiana and were chosen to represent the contrasted landscape of the region  (Ferry et al., 2010; Baraloto et al., 2011; Gond et al., 2011) . More specifically, we asked the following questions: 1. Which height-DBH model shape is both robust and convenient to use? 2. Do the height-DBH model parameters vary between sites? If so, do these variations affect the AGB predictions? 3. Can the forest plot stand structures and forest local environment explain the variability of the height-DBH model coefficients? To reach the objective of creating a height-DBH model for AGB predictions, height models were evaluated on their ability to replace measured heights in the forest plot for AGB predictions. We used a tree AGB model set in French Guiana. The AGB model used tree height, tree DBH and tree WSG to predict tree fresh AGB. It allowed for uncertainty from height and WSG predictions propagation through a Monte Carlo sampling process  (Molto et al., 2012) . To evaluate the performance of a height-DBH model, we predicted the AGBs of the trees using -1 measured height and -2 predicted heights. The degradation of the precision of the AGB prediction between -1 and -2 gave us a measure of the performance of the height-DBH model. 
 Material and methods 
 French Guiana The study was conducted in French Guiana. The climate of the region is equatorial, with two main seasons: a dry season from August to mid-November and a rainy season from December to April (often interrupted by a short drier period in March;  Wagner et al., 2011) . The relief comprises a hill system within a dense hydrographic network. Rainforests cover almost all the study area. 
 Forest plots Inventory data came from two projects recently conducted in French Guiana. The sampled plots are typical from the Guiana Shield forests  (Terborgh, and Andresen, 1998) . Dominant plant families include Lecythidacea (Eschweilera), Caesalpinaceae Caesalpiniaceae (Eperua), Chrysobalanaceae (Licania) and Sapotaceae. The tree species richness (DBH ≥ 10 cm) ranges from 130 to 200 species per hectare  (ter Steege et al., 2000) . A description of the forest plots is available in Supplement S2. These data represent a total of 9467 trees. -Inventories from the AMALIN project : 33 plots spread in various landscapes and topographical contexts (ridges, plateaus, and lowlands). DBHs and tree heights were measured by a team of trained experts. The plots were divided into two subplots (details in  Baraloto et al., 2011)  and represent a 0.1 hectare area (trees with DBH ≥ 10 cm) nested in a 0.5 hectare area (trees with DBH ≥ 20 cm). -Inventories from the BRIDGE project  (Baraloto et al., 2010) : 9 one-hectare plots where trees with DBH ≥ 10 were measured for DBHs and heights. Heights were measured with laser range finders or ropes when a climber could approach the tops of the trees. 
 Forest plot descriptors 
 Descriptors of the forest structure We chose variables commonly used by foresters to describe the stand DBH structure: the basal area (in m 2 per hectare) and the relative frequencies of four classes of stem size (between 10 cm and 20 cm, 20 cm and 40 cm, 40 cm and 60 cm, and above 60 cm). These descriptors were computed from DBH census data only; thus, they are always available in standard forest inventories. Because they sum up to 1 in each forest plot, the relative frequencies of classes of stem size are not linearly independent. In order to have a variable matrix x j of full rank (Eq. 8), we dropped the proportion of stems between 20 and 40 cm  (Hastie et al., 2009)   
 Descriptors of the environment We chose to work with mainstream, widely available environmental variables. Four of these were computed from a digital terrain model (DTM) with 90 m-sided squared cells (NASA SRTM missions). (i) The drained area measures the surface of the hydraulic basin that flows through a cell. A low value indicates cells located close to the limit of two basins, whereas higher values indicate cells located downstream. (ii) The hydraulic altitude was computed from the third-order hydraulic system. The hydraulic altitude of a cell is its altitude above the closest stream of its hydraulic basin. Lower values (including 0) indicate that the forest plot is located in a potentially temporarily flooded area, while higher values indicate that the forest plot is located at a top-hill area. (iii) The slope of each cell was computed with a 180 m 2-cell lag. (iv) The terrain ruggedness index (TRI) was computed with a 20-cell lag (1800 m) to catch the difference between flat and more mountainous landscapes. Two environmental variables were computed from the NASA TRMM rainfall data. One was the annual average rainfall in the last 10 years (in mm); the other was a dry season index (DSI), computed as the average number of months with rainfall below 100 mm  (Wagner et al., 2012) . The DSI quantifies the length of the annual hydraulic stress for trees. All maps and geographical information were computed with SAGA  (Bock et al., 2004) . 
 Height-DBH model shapes M1 (log-linear, Eq. 1) is a height-DBH model that has already been used for height-DBH modeling  (Nogueira et al., 2008) . Classically, the error term was additive normal, but we used a multiplicative lognormal to better address heteroscedasticity. The model may give negative values for DBH lower than 1, but this is not a problem since the DBH is larger than 10 in standard forest inventories. The model has no horizontal asymptote, but due to the log function, the increase in large DBH values is extremely slow. H i = (α + β × log DBH i ) ε i ε i ∼ LN(0, σ 2 ) (1) M2 (log-log, Eq. 2) is a model that is frequently used in forest ecology  (Brown et al., 1989; Feldpausch et al., 2011) . However, the existence of factors limiting tree growth in height but not in DBH may lead to questions about its basic assumptions. This model is known for overestimating the height of the large trees  (Feldpausch et al., 2011) . H i = exp (α + β × log DBH i ) ε i ε i ∼ LN(0, σ 2 ) (2) M3 (simplified Weibull, Eq. 3) is a non-linear model that is common in height-DBH relationship modeling  (Fang and Bailey, 1998; Feldpausch et al., 2011) . Its shape presents an oblique asymptote with slope α/β at (0, 0) and a horizontal asymptote H = α when the DBH is large. H i = α (1 − exp (−DBH i /β)) ε i ε i ∼ LN(0, σ 2 ) (3) M4 (Michaelis-Menten, Eq. 4) is a non-linear model, while very common in chemistry, that has rarely been employed to model height-DBH relationships  (Huang et al., 1992) . However, it presents all the required features: positive and increasing, with an oblique tangent line with slope β = α/γ in (0, 0) and a horizontal asymptote H = α when the DBH is large. H i = α×DBH i γ +DBH i ε i ε i ∼ LN(0, σ 2 ) (4) The model was re-arranged as follows to ease the parameter inference: H i = 1 1 α + 1 β×DBH i ε i ε i ∼ LN(0, σ 2 ). (5) All models have three parameters: two for the shape and one for the variance of the error term. In order to mechanistically increase the model uncertainty with height and DBH, the error term was modeled by a lognormal distribution. Keeping in mind that our objective was biomass prediction, each height-DBH observation was weighted by a proxy w i of the biomass of each single tree (Eq. 6). w i = DBH 2 i × H i (6) In each plot, the weights w i were normalized so their sum is the number of observations. The models M1 to M4 were calibrated for each forest plot. The four model shapes are represented in  Fig. 1 . Parameter estimations were conducted using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods (see Supplement S1). After discarding a burn-in sample and a thinning of the chains, 1000 samples of the posterior distribution of each parameter were kept (for M4, the posterior distribution of the parameters are presented in  Fig. 2) . The models inferred independently in each forest plot are referred to as the ""site-specific"" height-DBH model.  H i = 1/(1/α + 1(β × DBH i )ε i , ε i ∼ LN(0, σ 2 ). The last panel presents the predicted height distribution of a tree with a DBH of 50 cm. 
 Height-DBH model shape selection The AGB of each plot was computed. The AGB of a forest plot is the sum of the AGB of the trees from this plot divided by the surface of the plot, in Mg ha −1 . The tree AGB model predicts the mass of a tree from its DBH, height, and WSG 7. Uncertainties from height predictions, WSG predictions, and tree AGB model parameters are propagated through Monte Carlo samples of their respective distributions  (Molto et al., 2012) . log AGB i = β 0 + β 1 log DBH i + β 2 log H i + β 3 log WSG i + ε i ε i ∼ N(0, σ 2 ) (7) Two different definitions of the height H i of a tree i were used: field-measured heights and predicted heights. When the AGB of a tree was predicted (Eq. 7) with a height H i predicted from one of the four height models, Monte Carlo samples of the predicted height H i were generated from the posterior samples of the parameters and error term of the height-DBH model. The forest plot AGB distributions obtained from each height prediction were compared with the AGB distributions obtained from measured heights using the root mean squared error (RMSE)  (Fig. 3) . The selected height-DBH model was thereafter noted M*. In addition, the selected model M* was calibrated on the entire data set without site effect. This model was called ""regional"" model. (Eq. 8). The parameter σ was now unique, and we did not try to explain its plot-to-plot variation for identifiability reasons. The variables x j were scaled so the coefficients of the log-linear combination could be compared to each other. We used the exponential function to constrain the values of the parameters α p and β p to be positive. In models M2, M3, and M4, the coefficients α and β are positive for physical reasons: the height is a positive value and the height increases with the DBH. In the model M1, the α parameter is not necessarily positive. The observations were weighted as before (Eq. 6). For algorithm details of the estimation of θ α , I α , θ β , and I β , see Supplement S1.          α p = exp θ α,0 + j i α,j θ α,j x j,p β p = exp θ β,0 + j i β,j θ β,j x j,p (8) We used the method set by  Kuo and Mallick (1998)  to select the variables x j to be integrated in the final model. During parameter inference (see Supplement S1), an indicator i α,j (respectively i β,j ) associated with each variable x j for the parameter α (respectively β) can take two values: 1 indicates that the variable is kept in the model, and 0 indicates that the variable is not kept in the model (Eq. 7). Thanks to the indica-tors, the MCMC algorithm explored different combinations of variables. To decide whether a variable x j was kept in the model or not, we computed its percentage of presence in the explored models. This percentage was computed as the mean of the MCMC chain values of the indicator i α,j (respectively i β,j ) after a burn-in removal and a thinning. Usually, this percentage had the shape of a plateau followed by a rapid decrease. We aimed to keep the variables with a percent of selection close to the value of the plateau. The selected variables implicated in the replacement of α and β were not necessarily the same  (Fig. 4) . 
 Variable selection Because the environment has an obvious effect on the forest structure, we could not consider the structural and environmental variables in a single step. Thus, we first replaced the α and β coefficients by a linear combination of the stand structure variables only. The structural variables were selected using the method described above. The resulting model was called ""stand structure model""  (Fig. 4 , panels 1 and 3). Then, the environmental variables were added to the previous stand structure model. The variable selection procedure was run again, selecting the environmental variables only. In other words, an environmental variable was selected only if it caught variance that was not caught by the formerly selected structural variables  (Fig. 4, panels 2 and 4) . As for the comparison of the model shapes, the heights predicted with the stand structure model and the environment model were used to compute the AGB of the plots. In its ability to predict height to predict AGB, the best model including structure and eventually environmental variables is a compromise between the regional model (worst case) and the site-specific model (best case). The comparison of the AGB prediction RMSE allowed for quantification of how the variables describing the forest plots improved the regional model and how far the performances were from the sitespecific model. 
 Results 
 Model shape selection Overall, we found that α and β coefficients were different from one site to another  (Fig. 2 for model M4) , showing that the height-DBH relationship varied between locations. The posterior distributions of both parameters α and β were somehow correlated (r = −0.81), suggesting that the forest properties they catch are not independent. Using the α, β, and σ coefficients of the site-specific M* model, the heights were predicted with each model in each forest plot for a tree of 50 cm DBH  (Fig. 2) . The dotted lines indicate, in each selection process, which cut-off limit is chosen for the acceptance of a variable in the definitive models. The grey bar indicates the variables kept in the definitive model. The stand structure variables (first and third panels) were selected first. Then, keeping the selected structural variables, environmental variables were added to improve the model (second and last panels). Prop_X_Y -proportion of stems between X and Y cm, BA -basal Area, TRI_20terrain ruggedness index. For the four model shapes, the 95 % CI of the RMSE distributions completely overlap  (Fig. 3) : we found no significant differences between the four shapes in terms of biomass prediction. We decided to focus on model M4 for two main reasons: (1) it has biologically meaningful coefficients (contrary to M1 and M2), and (2) it is easier to manipulate than M3 and its exponential function.  
 Environmental and structural variable selection The selected structure variables explaining the observed variation of α were the basal area (negative effect), the proportion of small stems (strong negative effect), and the proportion of medium stems (negative effect). In addition, the slope (positive effect) and the rainfall (negative effect) were selected among the environmental variables  (Fig. 4 ,  Table 1 ). The selected structural variables involved in the replacement of β were the proportion of small stems (strong positive effect) and the proportion of bigger stems (positive effect). The rainfall (positive effect) and the drained area (negative effect) were selected from the environmental variables  (Fig. 4 ,  Table 1 ) to complete the structural variables. The variables selected for the replacement of α and β are not shared. All the selected parameters excluded zero from their 95 % confidence interval. The highest values were obtained for the proportion of small stems, highlighting its great explicative power. Environmental variables had very weak effects. 
 AGB prediction The RMSE of the model including structural and/or environmental variables was larger than the RMSE of the sitespecific model and smaller than the RMSE of the universal model  (Fig. 5) . The RMSE of the model including environmental variables did not differ from the RMSE of the model using structural variables only  (Fig. 5) . 
 Discussion Using a data set from diverse neotropical forests from French Guiana, we modeled the height-DBH relation using the Michaelis-Menten equation. The height-DBH relation varied between locations, which affected the AGB estimations. We then demonstrated that part of the height-DBH relation variability could be explained by variables issued from the forest structure and somewhat from descriptors of the local environment.  
 Biogeosciences 
 Model choice and parameter values in the site-specific model The four models were not significantly different from each other in terms of predicting height and therefore predicting AGB  (Figs. 1, 3) . We believe that our particular data weighting (Eq. 6) was responsible for this closeness. It suggested that, with this weighting, one can use any of these four models to predict heights and then predict biomass. We also emphasize that the Michaelis-Menten model mathematical form is easy to handle as it has no exponential function. Though the exponential model has been used in the past,  Feldpausch et al. (2012)  found that the Weibull model was the most appropriate for biomass prediction (they did not consider the Michaelis-Menten model). We thus conclude that asymptotic models should be preferred. Any comparison with published allometric models is often difficult because most studies do not report the error parameter of their fitted models. Given that the height is often log-transformed (e.g.,  Feldpausch et al., 2011)  to achieve linearity, the back-transformation requires the application of a correction factor. To take this into account, a simulated error term needs to be added to each log-scale model prediction before transforming back to the arithmetic scale. The α and β model parameters differed largely between forest plots  (Fig. 2) . This demonstrates that the height-DBH relationship was not the same in each plot, leading to contrasting height-DBH relationships and contrasting AGB values. The α parameters represented the value of the horizontal asymptote for the largest DBH. This value was highly correlated with the maximum observed height in each forest plot (α = 1.06 × H max , R 2 = 0.98, RSE = 6.7). This result has important practical consequences. While it is not reasonable to measure the height of all trees in large-scale inventories, it could be feasible to measure the 10 higher trees or so to get the maximum height of a forest plot. Moreover, the maximum height of a forest plot is a direct output from lidar measurements. In either of these cases, the α parameter will not be predicted from environmental variables but will be estimated more or less directly. If the α parameter is known, the construction of the height-DBH model is more simple, straightforward and precise because it depends only on finding β. The β parameter represented the slope of the oblique tangent in [0, 0]. The larger β is, the faster the trees reach the asymptote. β values showed less variation than α between forest plots  (Fig. 2) . This suggests that the parameter could be inferred at the region level, with no site effect on its value. However, because some plot-to-plot differences remained, we decided to test the forest structure and environmental effect on this parameter. If one aims to build a height-DBH model estimating α as suggested above, one could consider using a constant β parameter for simplicity. 
 Stand structure variables The competition for light between trees has been identified as a major driver of the tree height trajectory  (Clark, 1996; Guariguata and Ostertag, 2001; Luyssaert et al., 2008) . The proportion of small trees (10-20 cm DBH) has a strong positive effect on β together with a strong negative effect on α. In a forest patch with a high density of small trees, the tree competition causes trees to grow faster in height  (Hummel, 2000) . The small positive effect of the proportion of biggest trees (more than 60 cm DBH) on β also suggests that the presence of a large tree, limiting the light resource, also causes the smaller trees to grow faster in height.  
 Environmental variables Because the environment has an obvious effect on the forest structure , we decoupled in time the inclusion of structural and environmental variables in the final model. The negative effect of rainfall on α is unexpected. Rainfall, which is related to the water availability, has largely been described as a positive driver of forest height  (Koch et al., 2004; Ryan et al., 2006) . The negative effect of the drained area on β indicates that the trees grow more slowly in height in a seasonally flooded or waterlogged terrain. This is explained by (1) a greater light availability  (Ferry et al., 2010)  that is in turn linked to higher turnover rates  (Madelaine et al., 2007; Ferry et al., 2010)  and  (2)  higher mechanical constraints due to the lower soil stability in flooded areas  (Gale and Barfod, 1999; Gale and Hall, 2001) . The tradeoffs between the variables in α and β replacements, between α and β replacements and the low values of the model parameters means that that we should consider the highlighted patterns carefully. 
 Perspectives In this study, we showed that part of the variability of the height-DBH relationship was successfully explained by the forest stand structure, expressed as the proportion of small trees (10-20 cm DBH). While basal area and rainfall were the most important variables at world scale  (Feldpausch et al., 2011) , we did not find them crucial at the regional scale in French Guiana. Our study did not include any soil effects on the height-DBH relationship, though we interpreted the effect of highly drained areas as a possible indicator of soil instability. If available, information on soil parameters (such as physical properties or chemical composition) can improve the predictions of height  (Aiba and Kitayama, 1999; Quesada et al., 2009; Feldpausch et al., 2011) . Tree species is known to be an important determinant of tree height  (Poorter et al., 2005) . However, tropical forests have such a high diversity (up to 200 species ha −1 ; ter  Steege et al., 2000)  that individual species allometries cannot be inferred. Moreover, the use of a species-specific model for height prediction requires the species to be identified during the forest inventories. We wanted our method to be suitable for large-scale, quick inventories with no detailed species determination. Thus, we did not to include the tree species as a height predictor. To go further, sophisticated models could be developed incorporating more information at the tree level. For example, if the botanical information is available, a trait-based model may provide substantial improvement. The functional traits have proven to catch information on species biological properties that may be related to the height-DBH relationship  (Baraloto et al., 2010; Hérault et al., 2011) . The model can now be used to predict the coefficients of a height-DBH model for the entire region of French Guiana. The new AGB estimates using the new predicted height will help us understand the spatial patterns of AGB variations and produce more accurate carbon stock estimates.

Each of these diseases causes significant economic losses and animal deaths  [1] [2] [3] . Knowledge of the potential geographical range of these diseases can inform national and regional pest risk assessments, assisting biosecurity agencies to manage the invasion risks better by focusing scarce surveillance and prevention resources to protect endangered regions and assets  [4] . Several species of the genus Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) transmit BT, AHS and other major animal viruses. Culicoides imicola, an afro-oriental species, is widespread and has been reported from South Africa to southern Europe, and from western Africa to southern China  (Figure 1  and Appendix S1 in File S1). This species has historically retained the interest because biological transmission of AHS and BT viruses by Culicoides was first demonstrated in this species, and to date, C. imicola remains the unique vector for both AHS and BT viruses in the afro-oriental region  [5] [6] [7]  whereas it has been suspected for other Afrotropical Culicoides, such as C. bolitinos among others  [8] [9] [10] . It is also considered a key vector of both viruses in Africa, in the Middle East and the southern part of Europe due to the huge abundances it can attain  [6] . The distribution of C. imicola, especially in southern Europe, is an old and actual subject of interest as illustrated by AHS and BT history: AHS is endemic in areas of Sub-Saharan Africa, as highlighted by the recent outbreaks in Senegal in 2007  [1] , and has sporadically caused devastating outbreaks outside Africa, eg. in 1959-61 in the Middle East and in Asia (where over 300 000 equids died), and in 1987-90 on the Iberian Peninsula  [7] . Less than 10 years later, several serotypes of BT virus were transmitted intensively, leading to the death of hundreds of thousands sheep in the Mediterranean basin, in areas never previously affected by the virus  [11] . Abundant populations of C. imicola were recorded in most of these areas, where it was thought to be absent  [11] . Some authors have suggested that the distribution of C. imicola has expanded its range northwards in the last decades in Mediterranean Europe as climatic changes reduced the frequency and intensity of cold temperatures that limit overwintering potential  [12, 13] , whereas other studies challenged this hypothesis  [14, 15] . Under future climate conditions, Acevedo and co-authors projected that the distribution of C. imicola is expected to remain constant in Spain while its abundance is expected to increase due to increasing precipitation and changes in seasonality  [16] . Studies of the regional climatic niche of C. imicola had been developed from its distribution in Spain and Portugal  [17] , Morocco  [18] , Italy  [19] , the Mediterranean  [20, 21]  and South Africa  [22]  using correlative modelling methods. However, our study is the first to model the ecoclimatic niche of C. imicola, based on its global distribution. It is generally well accepted that our climate is changing in response to anthropogenic emissions of CO 2 and other greenhouse gases. What is generally poorly appreciated is that our ability to forecast the future climatic conditions may be as limited by our ability to forecast factors such as patterns of socio-economic and technological development and human demography than by our ability to model the resulting atmospheric dynamics that drive global and regional climatic patterns  [23] [24] [25] [26] . These anthropogenic factors are difficult or impossible to predict at useful periods into the future, and they strongly influence the rate of emission of the greenhouse gases that are driving the observed and projected climatic changes. To address this problem the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) generated a series of social, economic and technological developmental storylines as a basis for the creation of future climate scenarios  [27] . These storylines were intended to describe equally plausible future development paths that could be used to explore the sensitivity of climate-sensitive systems. Unfortunately, there has been a tendency to misunderstand or misuse the results of analyses based on these storylines, treating them as if they had predictive power. In this paper we apply a set of two scenarios to a biophysical model in order to highlight areas of potential future concerns for biosecurity risk managers. Note however, that in no way do we present these results as prediction of what will occur. Rather, they form a stresstest of the biosecurity risk patterns based on modelling using historical climatic data. Ecoclimatic niche modelling has been used widely to explore the effects of climate change on the potential geographical range of many species of pest and conservation concern. CLIMEX [28] is a process-oriented niche model that can draw on both inferential and deductive modelling methods  [29] . The model describes species' responses to climatic conditions and estimates species' potential distribution based upon climatic suitability. Due to its process-oriented formulation, CLIMEX is well suited for projecting species' potential distributions in novel climates such as inter-continental projections and future climatic scenarios  [30] [31] [32] . As a primary step for evaluating the risks for these diseases at a particular location we investigated the ecoclimatic niche of C. imicola, a competent vector species for major animal viral diseases and projected its potential distribution under selected climate change scenarios. 
 Methods 
 Geographical distribution of Culicoides imicola We compiled a geo-database of 1 381 individual presence records of C. imicola from published sources (Appendix S1 in File S1). To address problems with duplication and autocorrelation in assessing the goodness of fit, the individual point locations were transformed into 879 unique cells with 109 resolution. The 879 presence records of C. imicola were split into three subsets (  Figure 1 ): 1) a training dataset to develop the model (Sub-Saharan Africa, 187 records), 2) a verification dataset, to adjust the model at unfitted locations (South-Eastern Europe, Middle East and Asia, 131 records) and 3) a validation dataset used to infer the strengths and limitations of the model (Western Europe and North Africa, 561 records). In selecting the distribution data sub-sets, we aimed to keep a maximum range of different climate categories in each zone, but also independence between zones with physical boundaries (Saharan desert, Red Sea and Adriatic Sea, cross-hatched areas in  Figure 1 ). We used the Köppen-Geiger (KG) climate classification  [33]  and ensured that training, verification and validation zones shared similar climatic ranges, except for an equatorial climate, which was not represented in the validation zone. Africa was assigned to training because C. imicola was first described there (holotype from Kenya, Kieffer, 1913 cited in Borkent,  [34] ) and is considered as the historical distribution area  [35] . The validation dataset encompassed western Europe where the range of C. imicola's distribution is still under debate  [15, 36] . 
 Climate data CLIMEX requires five climate variables: monthly values for minimum and maximum temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity at 9am and at 3pm. We used the CliMond 1975H_V1.1 fine spatial resolution (109) global climate dataset  [37] . CliMond includes monthly climate data averages centred on 1975, so-called historical climate dataset, and a total of eight future climate scenarios: ie. for 2030 and 2070, for two global climatic models, CSIRO-MK3.0 and Miroc-h, and two greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, A1B and A2 (4 future climate datasets for each year). 
 CLIMEX CLIMEX is a dynamic bioclimatic niche model that integrates modelled weekly responses of a population to climate in order to create a series of climatic suitability indices that can be mapped or graphed  [28, 29] . CLIMEX calculates an annual Growth Index (GI A ) to describe the potential for population growth as a function of weekly soil moisture and temperature during favourable conditions (Eq. 1). GI A~1 00 X 52 i~1 GI W i =52 ð1Þ where GI W is the weekly Growth Index, composed of the weekly Temperature Index multiplied by the weekly Moisture Index. The Temperature Index and the Moisture Index are specified with a functional form that accords with the Law of Tolerance  [38] [39] [40]  and are combined in a multiplicative manner that accords with the Law of the Minimum  [41] . It uses up to eight stress indices (cold, wet, hot, dry, cold-wet, cold-dry, hot-wet and hot-dry; respectively CS, WS, HS, DS, CWX, CDX, HWX, HDX) to estimate the ability of the population to survive unfavourable conditions (Eqs. 2,3).  The Ecoclimatic Index (EI) summarises the balance between the opportunity for the species to grow during the favourable season(s) and the requirement to survive inclement season(s), and scales from 0 (unsuitable) to 100 (optimal) (Eq. 4). EI~GI A |SI|SX ð4Þ CLIMEX models are best informed by fitting the stresses to the boundary of the known range of the species, using knowledge, when available, about its biology or ecology to inform thresholds and rate parameters. The temperature and soil moisture weekly growth indices (GI w ) were informed mostly by knowledge of the species biology and sometimes by using phenological observations and matched climates to infer growth limits and optima. In our model, we tested the assumption that the presence of C. imicola in arid areas was due to irrigation maintaining suitable microclimate. The area under irrigation was identified using the data from Siebert et al.  [42]  describing presence of irrigation practices. In these areas we used CLIMEX irrigation scenario applying 3.5 mm per day as a ''top-up'', ie. during dry season, irrigation increases the rainfall equivalent to this limit  [29] . 
 Parameter-fitting, model validation and projection Rainfall and temperature are known to drive activity, survival and seasonality of Culicoides  [6, 43] . Initial values for the Growth and Stress parameters for the C. imicola CLIMEX model were informed by the following ecological traits. The species is present in warm and equatorial climatic conditions  (Figure 1 ), but in regions where C. imicola is the main vector species for BT, it can persist over winter where daily maximum temperatures are greater than 12.5uC  [44] [45] [46] , and in Italy the probability of presence was close to zero where annual average of minimum daily temperatures fell below 9uC  [47] . In laboratory studies Paweska et al.  [9]  noted that the minimum temperature for replication of bluetongue virus serotype 1 (BTV-1) in C. imicola was between 10uC and 15uC. In the Mediterranean region, the probability of C. imicola presence was greatest when minimum daily temperatures were greater than 16uC and increased with increasing relative humidity from 40% to its maximum at 60%  [47] . In Morocco and Iberia  [18] , and in South Africa  [22] , minimum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a variable correlated with soil moisture, is positively correlated with C. imicola abundance. The natural rainfall model was fitted initially to C. imicola's distribution only in the training zone until all occurrences receiving adequate rainfall to support a minimal amount of grass growth were modelled as being at least barely climatically suitable (minimising the climatically suitable area using biologically reasonable parameter values). The rationale for considering grass growth is that it is necessary to support the vertebrate hosts of C. imicola. Cold Stress. We fitted a cold stress function to constrain survival to the coldest areas where C. imicola had been reported in traps. Model parameters and intermediate steps in model development, successively using training, verification and validation datasets  (Figure 1 ), are detailed in Appendix S2 in File S1. The ''immature model'', fitted to the native range distribution data, was tested against the verification area  (Figure 1 ), comparing the region where EI.0 with occurrence records in South Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Where necessary, we adjusted the model during the verification step which resulted in a second model named the ''completed model''. This step allowed us to make adjustments for any enemy release effects  [48] . Each model was validated by calculating its sensitivity score: the proportion of records falling in locations modelled as being climatically suitable (EI.0). In addition, the degree of departure from random prediction was tested with the exact one-tailed binomial statistic  [32]  which measures the statistical significance of sensitivity scores given the modelled prevalence, ie. the proportion of the model universe that is climatically suitable. A useful model should have a high sensitivity score reflecting that recorded locations are modelled as being climatically suitable, and a significant binomial statistic score ensuring the model projection does not cover an excessive proportion of the study area. The completed model was then run using the global dataset under historical climate and future climate scenarios. 
 Results The geographical range of C. imicola appears primarily limited by cold stress and dry stress, and to a lesser extent wet stress. Its modelled potential distribution accords well with its known distribution in Africa, the Middle East and southern Europe  (Figures 2, and SI2 , SI3 and SI4 in File S1). The modelled climate suitability in France and continental Asia encompasses the reported distribution, but also extends well beyond the reported distribution. The model indicates large areas in the Americas and South-East Asia as being climatically suitable. The probable role of irrigation in extending the potential range of C. imicola into xeric regions is indicated by how well the composite risk map improved the model sensitivity score without affecting the model specificity significantly  (Table SI2, Figures SI2  and SI3 in Appendix S2 in File S1). For the three datasets, the completed model explained the presence of C. imicola in 833 grid cells at 109 resolution and the addition of irrigation component explained an additional 38 records in arid areas (Appendix S2 in File S1). Only 8 occurrence records were not fitted in the composite irrigation model (Appendix S2,  Figure SI4b  in File S1). Under the natural rainfall future climate scenario, C. imicola's projected potential distribution for climate scenario A2, generated by CSIRO-MK3.0 model, projected in 2070  (Figure 3 ) expands into areas that are presently too cold for persistence, and contracts from areas that are set to become more xeric. Similar changes in ecoclimatic suitability patterns were observed with other climate projections (ie. 2030 projections, A1B climatic scenario or Miroc-h climate model, see  Figure SI5  and SI6 in Appendix S3, in File S1). In the scenarios considered, most of the potential range expansion due to a warming climate occurs in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, where terrestrial habitat is limited to lower latitudes, most of the potential range expansion under the climate change scenario is into higher altitude areas. A similar response pattern was observed in equatorial regions  (Figure 3 ).  
 Discussion There appears to be substantial opportunity for range expansion of C. imicola into the Americas and Australasia should it be translocated to these regions; the climate appears moderate to highly suitable over large areas, and domestic ruminant and equid hosts abound. Should C. imicola spread southwards into the Indonesian archipelago or Papua New Guinea, it is entirely feasible that it could spread to Australia  [49] , potentially increasing the risk of transmission of BT and AHS in Australia, and possibly the northern parts of New Zealand with a milder climate. In Australia, C. imicola would be adding to an extant community of competent vectors so the extent of the added risk is unknown. The use of the irrigation information from Siebert et al.  [42]  allowed us to capture the effect of crop irrigation in supporting populations of C. imicola in xeric regions, without creating a risk map that indicated that vast areas of desert were climatically suited. The few location records in  Figure 2  that fall in apparently climatically unsuitable locations are most likely the result of populations that are able to persist by virtue of small livestock watering points not captured by the irrigation dataset of Siebert et al.  [42] , perhaps signalling a scaling limitation regarding the use of this data. Agencies with biosecurity responsibilities in xeric regions may therefore wish to consider the irrigation climatic risk scenario independently of the irrigation locations indicated in Siebert et al.  [42] . This risk map could indicate climate suitability for C. imicola in areas where soil moisture availability is not well modelled using natural rainfall and crop irrigation is not captured in the dataset of Siebert et al.  [42] . The map of ecoclimatic suitability  (Figure 2 ) approximates the fundamental niche of C. imicola (potential distribution negating limiting factors). As is commonly observed, the modelled potential distribution is wider than the observed distribution and the difference has several assumed origins: 1) Biotic factors, not included in our model, and especially presence and abundance of hosts which are important to maintain a blood feeding species such as C. imicola. Considering abundances of wild and domestic hosts is particularly important when modelling C. imicola's abundance  [16] . 2) Incomplete sampling: apart from Europe, surveys have been implemented in a limited number of countries such as, for example, South Africa and Kenya, whereas other countries were under sampled (see point densities by countries in  Figure 1  and  Table SI1  in Appendix S1 in File S1). Further capture and identification of Culicoides species, especially in areas foreseen as highly suitable such as India and China, could improve our understanding of the ecoclimatic requirements of the species. 3) An ongoing (dynamic) process of colonization. Indeed, there have been no reports of C. imicola captured in the South West of France despite a dense and regularly surveyed trap network  [36]  (  Figure SI4b  in File S1); despite this area being modelled as suitable, and lies close to regions where some populations have been reported (South East of France, Venail et al.  [36] ; North West of Spain, Goldarazena et al.  [50] ). The colonization process is dependent on dispersal abilities, size of the source population, meteorological conditions and the presence of natural barriers. Venail et al.  [36]  discussed the confined distribution of C. imicola in South East France by physical altitudinal barriers. 4) Geographically isolated landmasses such as America and Australia with territories where ecoclimatic conditions are suitable and therefore insect establishment may be possible (however note that other processes, not considered here, such as competition and parasitism for example, could prevent for species establishment). Identification of such territories is relevant for biosecurity purposes: even if intercontinental dispersal of the vector is unlikely, importation of hitchhiking insects along with trade has been reported previously for other insects (eg. Caton et al.,  [51] ) and is well known for Aedine mosquitoes. Besides, the introduction of exotic serotypes in Northern Europe in 2008 and the novel emergence of Schmallenberg virus in the same area highlight our misunderstanding of the possible entry routes. We found that C. imicola shares temperature requirements for development and survival with one Australasian Culicoides: optimal temperatures for survival of larva of C. brevitarsis range between 20 and 35.5uC (unfortunately temperatures lower than 20uC were not tested) and temperatures greater or equal 38uC are lethal  [52] . Murray and Nix  [53]  found that adult activity of C. brevitarsis started at 12uC. The modelled range for survival of C. imicola in our study is 12-36uC (  Figure SI1  in File S1). No information is available on moisture requirements for C. brevitarsis but the known distribution of C. brevitarsis  [54]  is similar to the projected potential distribution of C. imicola in Australia (  Figure 2 ). Furthermore, other evidence relates the two species: phylogenetic analyses of different Culicoides species show that C. brevitarsis sampled from Japan  [55]  are closely related to C. imicola from South Africa  [56] , from France and Israel  [57, 58] . Like C. imicola, C. brevitarsis is also competent for bluetongue virus  [59] . Some authors have suggested a common Culicoides ancestral species for C. brevitarsis and C. imicola  [35]  but further study would be required to test this hypothesis. Culicoides imicola is the main vector of AHSV but we think that testing the competency of C. brevitarsis for AHSV would be informative for assessing biosecurity risks. Under the future climate scenario, parts of Namibia, Botswana, Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia could become unsuitable for C. imicola in the future, whereas the model projects a Northern expansion of suitable climate especially in Europe and China (  Figure 3 ). However, presence of the vector is only one of the required conditions for vector-borne diseases to spread; appropriate hosts and presence of the pathogen are also required along with climatic conditions enabling vector activity, in particular vector-host contact, and pathogen replication. A complete risk assessment should also consider host densities and their relationship with vector densities  [60, 61]  and account for transmission routes from infected areas  [49, 62] . Our study enables us to indirectly infer current and future risks of bluetongue and African horse sickness, diseases both transmitted by C. imicola, and thereby provides a framework for updating management and biosecurity strategies to target disease epizootics.

A number of plant and animal species are known to be endemic from small islands or archipelagos, having evolved in isolation from their continental relatives during long periods of time. Such systems are typically seen as natural laboratories for the study of adaptation  [1] . Invading an island means entering a new biotic environment, that is, a new community of competitors, predators, preys and parasites, and a reduced total amount of available food. This sudden ecological challenge must be faced by a supposedly small number of migrants, in a context of reduced or null gene flow from the mainland. The successful colonization of an island by a new species is therefore likely to be driven by rapid adaptive evolution. Consistently, evolution on islands is often associated with rapid morphological changes  [2] , the observation of which has been of major importance in Darwin's thoughts and conceptions. In the genomic era, the search for the molecular targets of such adaptive processes appears as a promising quest. A second reason why island endemic species are of specific interest to evolutionary biologists is their supposedly reduced population size. The effective population size (N e ) is a central parameter of the population genetic theory, which determines the strength of genetic drift, the random fluctuation of allele frequencies generation after generation. The theory makes a number of important predictions regarding the influence of N e on patterns of molecular diversity. First, small populations are expected to be genetically less diverse than large populations because of the reduced sojourn time of neutral mutations in the former. The existing data seem in broad agreement with this prediction at a wide phylogenetic scale  [3, 4] . In studies of more restricted taxonomic groups, a relationship between population size predictors and genetic diversity has been reported in fish  [5] , but not in mammals  [6]  or birds  [7] , despite abundant genetic data in the latter two taxa. Importantly, genetic drift is also expected to decrease the efficiency of natural selection, as it pushes the frequency of an allele up and down irrespective of its contribution to fitness. Consequently, natural selection in favor of slightly advantageous mutations and in disfavor of slightly deleterious mutations is supposed to be less efficient in small than in large populations  [8] . It was convincingly argued that the N e effect is the major explanation for the difference in genome architecture between prokaryotes and large organisms  [9] . Besides this contrast, it would appear important to determine whether the N e effect on selection efficiency is detectable at a more recent phylogenetic scale, that is, between closely-related species. In particular, whether species affected by a recent drop in population size are 'genetically endangered' (that is, suffer from an increased load of deleterious mutations) is still debated  [6, 10] . To date, empirical evidence regarding the influence of N e on the efficiency of natural selection is not so abundant. The most convincing contribution was the report in mammals of a positive correlation between body mass and the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (d N /d S )  [11] . An increased d N /d S ratio is expected when the efficiency of purifying selection against deleterious non-synonymous changes is weakened. The mammalian pattern was therefore interpreted as a N e effect, plausibly assuming that populations of large animals tend to be smaller than populations of small animals, on average. Still in mammals, the evolutionary rate of non-coding sequences upstream and downstream of genes was reported to be faster in primates than in rodents, which was interpreted in terms of a reduced N e in primates  [12] . One problem for testing the population size effect on patterns of molecular variation is that we typically have no direct measurement of N e , which in the above-cited studies was indirectly approached through various surrogates (for example, body mass, conservation status, marine vs. terrestrial habitat). The long-term average N e , which is the relevant parameter in molecular evolution, may be badly predicted by current species abundance  [6, 7] . Islands provide a good opportunity to cope with these problems: island endemic species are likely to have evolved in small populations during long periods of time, owing to the overall limitation in space and resource availability. Consistent with this prediction, an increased d N /d S ratio for mitochondrial genes was reported in island endemic species, as compared to their mainland relatives  [13, 14] , which was again interpreted as reflecting a weakened efficiency of purifying selection due to a smaller longterm N e . The signature of a reduced N e in the islands, although significant, was only observed in approximately 60% of the island/mainland couples  [14] , perhaps because of a lack of power -just one or two genes were analyzed for each species pair (and see reference  [15] ). It should also be noted that the d N /d S ratio, used in most of the abovementioned studies, is not only determined by the strength of purifying selection, but also by the rate of adaptive amino-acid substitutions, which in some species can be far from negligible  [16] . If adaptation on islands was a prominent process at the molecular level too, then the d N /d S ratio might be inflated independently of demographic effects. In this case, the ratio of non-synonymous over synonymous polymorphism (π N /π S ), not divergence, would be a more appropriate marker of a reduced N e , since it is much less affected by adaptive evolution than the d N /d S ratio  [17] . The availability of within-species variation data is therefore of primary importance to disentangle the adaptive vs. non-adaptive forces driving molecular evolution on islands. Here we present a population genomic study of the giant Galápagos tortoise, Chelonoidis nigra, an endangered species endemic from the Galápagos archipelago. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analyses suggested that this insular species has been isolated from the South American continent during millions of years  [18, 19] . C. nigra is together with the Aldabra tortoise the largest known living species of terrestrial turtles, much larger than its mainland congenerics, and can live well above 100 years. Its new environment, the Galápagos archipelago, is affected by strong climatic fluctuations in space and time, with some islands being generally quite arid, and all of them experiencing long periods of drought associated to 'El Niño' southern oscillations  [20] . C. nigra is therefore a perfect model for the study of adaptation following island colonization. On the other hand, its large size combined to its endemic status is suggestive of a small long-term N e for this species, which might have favored non-adaptive evolution through reinforced genetic drift. To test these hypotheses and quantify the relative influence of positive vs. purifying selection, the transcriptomic diversity of five individuals was investigated and compared to similar data gathered in several continental species of turtle. 
 Results 
 Datasets Five C. nigra individuals from three distinct subspecies were analyzed  (Table 1 , Additional file 1:  Figure S1 ). Besides C. nigra, samples from the congeneric red-footed tortoise C. carbonaria and from the Spanish pond turtle Mauremys leprosa (one individual each) were also collected. The dataset was completed by transcriptome data from the previously published European pond turtle Emys orbicularis (10 individuals) and pond slider Trachemys scripta (three individuals,  Table 2 ). 
 Turtle phylogenomics We first analyzed a dataset of 248 orthologous genes in eight turtle species. The tree topology we obtained (  Figure 1 ) was consistent with published Testudines phylogenies  [25, 26] . Branch lengths in  Figure 1  are proportional to time, whereas branch thickness reflects the estimated per million years rate of synonymous substitution, obtained by dividing synonymous branch lengths by absolute divergence time. The three tropical lineages (Phrynops, Pelodiscus, and Chelonoidis) showed a higher synonymous substitution rate than the marine (Caretta caretta) and temperate ones (Emys, Trachemys, Mauremys), consistent with a recent report in turtles of a negative correlation between synonymous substitution rate and latitude in turtles  [27] . Colors in  Figure 1  reflect lineage-specific d N /d S ratio. The ratio was highly heterogeneous across lineages, as revealed by the significantly better fit of a model assuming one specific d N /d S ratio per branch, compared to a oneratio model (2*delta log likelihood = 1,472, 15 degrees of freedom, p-val <10 -100 ). Interestingly, the C. nigra branch was the one showing the highest d N /d S ratio. This appears consistent with the hypothesis of faster non-synonymous evolutionary rate in the islands  [14] . However, according to a phylogenetic analysis of five genes in 32 Testudinoidea species  [28] , the divergence between the C. nigra and C. carbonaria lineages dates back to approximately 30 million years ago, whereas the colonization of the Galápagos archipelago by C. nigra must be younger than 3 to 4 million years, that is, the age of the oldest Galápagos Islands (see Discussion). Whether insularity explains the high d N /d S ratio observed in the C. nigra branch is therefore unclear. Within-species data are clearly more appropriate to specifically address this issue. 
 C. nigra coding sequence polymorphism In C. nigra, individual genotypes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were called using a probabilistic approach paying specific attention to the removal of spurious SNPs due to hidden paralogy. Various conditions were tried regarding the stringency of paralog filtering and the minimal number of genotyped individuals required to validate a SNP  (Table 3 , see Methods). Only contigs for which an ORF longer than 200 base pairs (bp) was predicted and an ortholog was detected in C. carbonaria were included in this (and subsequent) analyses. Between 814 and 1,059 predicted ORFs were analyzed, depending on the settings. They yielded 769 to 1,933 coding SNPs, of which >99.5% were biallelic. Results were reasonably  consistent across conditions. Increasing the minimal required number of individuals resulted in a moderate increase in estimated π S , and a moderate decrease in π N /π S ratio. Increasing the paralog filtering stringency resulted in a decreased π S , as expected, but hardly affected the estimated π N /π S . The sampling variance of these estimates was acceptably low: the width of bootstrap confidence intervals was 10% to 15% of the π S average, and 15% to 20% of the π N /π S one. The results corresponding to condition A3 are shown in  Figure 2 , and compared with a similar analysis conducted in the continental European pond turtle E. orbicularis  (Table 3 , last line). The average estimated synonymous diversity (π S ) in C. nigra was 0.0013 to 0.0019, that is, a very low value, similar to the human one  [6] . No positive FIT was detected, meaning that the two alleles of a given individual were not more similar, on average, than two alleles sampled in two distinct individuals. Likewise, no significant FST was detected between the two mitochondrial clades sampled in this study, that is, clade c (three individuals) and clade d (two individuals,  Table 1 ). The estimated average π N /π S ratio in C. nigra was around 0.3. This is higher than the highest π N /π S ratio reported so far (approximately 0.2 in human). The average C. nigra/C. carbonaria d N /d S ratio in this analysis was 0.13 to 0.15. This value is similar to the human-specific and chimpanzee-specific dN/d S ratios  [6] , but still substantially lower than the C. nigra π N /π S ratio. Consequently, the neutrality index was above unity  (Figure 2 ), even after removal of low-frequency variants, and the proportion of adaptive amino-acid substitution estimated by the McDonald-Kreitman method, α and α 0.2 , was below zero in C. nigra. When a method accounting for the whole distribution of allele frequencies was used  [29] , an estimate of 0.13 was obtained, with a confidence interval including zero. The other turtle species for which we have within-species variation data, E. orbicularis, did not show such an extreme population genomic pattern: π S and α were higher, and π N /π S and d N /d S lower, in E. orbicularis than in C. nigra (  Figure 2 ). These results are indicative of an extremely small long-term N e in the Galápagos tortoise, and suggest that the elevated rate of non-synonymous substitutions observed in C. nigra is in the first place a consequence of increased genetic drift, not accelerated adaptive evolution. 
 Flanking sequences To further investigate this hypothesis, we examined the evolution of potential targets of weak selection, namely  coding region-flanking sequences. In C. nigra, we extracted 158 5′ UTR and 598 3′ UTR sequences of length above 50 bp, and measured levels of genetic diversity based on sites genotyped in at least four individuals (out of five). In E. orbicularis, we similarly analyzed 89 5′ UTR and 457 3′ UTR sequences, requiring that at least eight individuals (out of 10) were genotyped.  Figure 3  summarizes the relative levels of within-species diversity at 5′ UTR, 3′ UTR, synonymous and non-synonymous sites in the two species. In E. orbicularis, the 5′ and especially the 3′ UTR sequences showed a significantly lower amount of diversity than synonymous sites, suggesting that these sequences are under selective pressure. The selective constraint, although detectable, was much less pronounced than for non-synonymous sites, as reflected by the higher π UTR /π S than π N /π S ratio, in line with similar observations made in mammals  [12]  and birds  [30] . The strength of purifying selection on UTR sequences appeared weaker in C. nigra. No significant constraint was detected in 5′ flanking sites, and the estimated level of constraint on 3′ flanking sites was reduced, compared to E. orbicularis. This is consistent with the π N /π S pattern across species, and with the hypothesis of a reduced N e in the Galápagos tortoise. In neither of the two species did we detect a progressive decrease in the amount of selective constraint with increasing distance to the coding sequence, in contrast with the published mammal and bird analyses  [12, 30] . We suggest that the difference may result from the fact that we are here analyzing cDNA sequences, whereas the two above-cited studies analyzed genomic sequences. Consequently, our flanking regions only include UTR, whereas theirs included both UTR and untranscribed regions, the proportion of which presumably increases as ones moves away from the coding sequence. For this reason, π flanking / π S estimates should not be directly compared between turtles, mammals, and birds across the three studies. 
 Gene expression analysis Gene-specific expression profiles were estimated in the five turtle species for which Illumina data were available. Correlation coefficients of log-transformed, normalized π N /π S Chelonoidis nigra Emys orbicularis  Figure 2  Distribution of population genomic statistics across predicted coding sequences in C. nigra and E. orbicularis. π N /π S distribution: coding sequences for which π S = 0 were omitted.

 Chelonoidis nigra Emys orbicularis π N /π S π 5 /π S π 3 /π S orbicularis. π S : average nucleotide diversity at synonymous sites; π 5 : average nucleotide diversity at 5′-UTR sites; π 3 : average nucleotide diversity at 3′-UTR sites. Very similar results were obtained when we only analyzed predicted cDNAs for which both coding sequence and 3′ UTR sequence were available, and when we restricted the analysis to the 500 first bases of the 3′ UTR regions. expression levels across genes were calculated for each pair of species. The Testudinidae (C. nigra/C. carbonaria) and Emydidae (E.orbicularis/T. scripta) pairs showed the highest level of correlation of gene expression (r2 = 0.78 and r2 = 0.73, respectively). A neighbor-joining analysis of the pairwise correlation matrix produced the ((E. orbicularis, T. scripta), M. leprosa, (C. carbonaria, C. nigra)) topology, in agreement with published turtle phylogenies. Branch lengths revealed no specific pattern in the C. nigra lineage, which did not show an accelerated evolutionary rate of gene expression pattern. Rather, the M. leprosa lineage was the fastest evolving in this analysis (Additional file 2). 
 Gene ontology analysis Functional annotation of the C. nigra and E. orbicularis predicted cDNAs was achieved by sequence similarity using the generic GO-slim 'Biological process' gene ontology. Roughly two-thirds of the 2,774 annotated coding sequences (ORFs) were associated to metabolic genes, the other ones being associated to transport, regulation, cellular growth and organization, or immunity (  Figure 4 , Additional file 3:  Table S1 ). For each GO-slim term, the average log-transformed π N /π S ratio was calculated and compared between the two species, in search for terms showing a specific increase or decrease in selective pressure in C. nigra. This was achieved through a z-score analysis accounting for sampling variance and global genomic trends (see Material and methods).  Figure 5  plots the term-specific average π N /π S ratio (left panel), and its normalized version (right panel, z-score), in C. nigra versus E. orbicularis. A majority of terms show a π N /π S ratio lower than the genomic average, and therefore a negative z-score. This reflects the fact that coding sequences for which a functional annotation was obtained are more conserved, on average, than the non-annotated ones. Colored circles show the terms for which we detected a significant contrast in π N /π S ratio between the two species, as reflected by the Δ z statistics (see Material and methods). Four terms showed a significantly positive Δ z , that is, a higher π N /π S ratio in C. nigra than in E. orbicularis relative to genomic averages: 'RNA metabolic process' , 'translation' , 'catabolic process' , 'nucleotide metabolic process'. Two terms showed the opposite trend, that is, a lower π N /π S ratio in C. nigra: 'immune system process' and 'response to stress' (Additional file 3:  Table S1 ). 
 Discussion Genome-wide studies have been so far largely restricted to model organisms, that is, domestic or laboratory species. Here, thanks to NGS technologies, we were able to characterize for the first time the transcriptomic variability and population genomics of an endangered, emblematic species, the giant Galápagos tortoise, in absence of prior genomic knowledge. One specificity of our sample is the lack of geographic information: we do not exactly know from which locality   Figure 4  Functional annotation of coding sequences analyzed in C. nigra and E. orbicularis.

The generic categories used in this figure were defined by grouping terms from the 'biological process' GO-slim ontology as indicated in Additional file 3:  Table S1 , second colon. and each island of the Galápagos archipelago the sampled individuals come from. This is a general problem with C. nigra: previous genetic studies have shown that the current location of a turtle is not a reliable indicator of its true origin because of human-made translocations  [21, 31] . For this reason, these studies concluded that a genetic assignment of lineage of origin is the most trustworthy tool to use. Our sample, which covers a wide range of C. nigra mitochondrial and microsatellite lineages, is appropriate with respect to this criterion. Importantly, our analysis revealed no departure from panmixy in C. nigra. This is the most favorable situation for studying population genomics and molecular evolution, in which any random sample of individuals is expected to provide an unbiased estimate of the species genetic diversity, irrespective of geography. We conclude that this potential concern regarding sampling is unlikely to affect our conclusions, even though they would be worth confirming based on a larger population sample. 
 Divergence times and substitution rates within the chelonoidis genus Our phylogenetic analysis revealed a significant heterogeneity in d N /d S ratio across branches, with C. nigra showing the highest d N /d S ratio of all the analyzed turtle lineages. This is consistent with the hypothesis of a reduced population size in the giant Galápagos tortoise. To what extent the high d N /d S ratio in C. nigra is explained by its insularity is unclear, however, and dependent on the timing of divergence within the Chelonoidis genus and colonization of the Galápagos archipelago. The literature is contradictory regarding the divergence date between C. nigra and C. carbonaria. In a phylogenetic analysis of five genes in 32 Testudinoidea species and one fossil calibration, Le and McCord  [28]  estimated that the C. nigra/C. carbonaria split occurred 29 +/− 7 million years ago. However, from an analysis of mitochondrial DNA within the Chelonoidis genus and a biogeographic calibration, it was suggested that C. nigra diverged from its closest relative C. chilensis as early as 3.2 million years ago  [19] . Propagating this estimate to the C. nigra/C. carbonaria pair based on their data yields an estimated age of approximately 5 million years ago for this split, that is, six times younger than the Le and McCord figure. Our analysis of 248 nuclear genes indicates that the average amount of synonymous divergence between C. nigra and C. carbonaria is 0.052 substitutions per synonymous site (Additional file 2). Assuming a divergence as recent as approximately 5 million years for this split would imply a synonymous substitution rate of approximately 5.10 -3 substitution per site per million years in Chelonoidis. This is well outside the range of nuclear synonymous substitution rate recently estimated across 132 turtle species (three nuclear genes)  [27] , and 20 times as high as the median rate in this study. Such a dramatic increase in substitution rate would be expected to substantially lengthen Chelonoidis branches in molecular phylogenies -an effect that was not conspicuous in references  [26]  and  [28] . In contrast, the 29 million years estimate of Le and McCord, which was used in this study, would imply a plausible synonymous rate estimate of 9.10 -4 substitution per site per million years in the Chelonoidis genus. One reason for the unexpectedly recent divergence times inferred by Poulakakis et al.  [19]  is their assumption that the C. nigra/C. chilensis split occurred at the time of the emergence of the first Galápagos   Figure 5  GO term-specific π N /π S analysis in C. nigra and E. orbicularis.

Islands, that is, 2.2 to 4 million years ago. This does not need to be necessarily true: the split might have predated the emergence of the archipelago, assuming that the ancestral species that invaded the islands some Mya has gone extinct in the continent since then  [18] . According to this scenario, only about 10% of the C. nigra branch in the tree of  Figure 1  would be associated with insularity, which perhaps explains the modest d N /d S increase in this lineage compared to, for example, the C. carbonaria branch. 
 A typical low-N e species The average synonymous diversity in C. nigra was very low (π S = 0.0013 to 0.0019), much lower than in the similarly analyzed European pond turtle E. orbicularis. Among vertebrates, levels of synonymous diversity below our C. nigra estimate have only been reported in the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus (π S = 0.0012), and Homo sapiens (π S = 0.0012)  [6] . Noticeably, this top-three list of lowdiversity champions includes very diverse species in terms of current abundance -the geographically restricted Galápagos tortoise, the relatively abundant, locally invasive common marmoset, and the highly successful humans. Besides its low genome-average level of genetic polymorphism, we found an extremely high ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous diversity in C. nigra. Our π N /π S estimate (0.28 to 0.32) is the highest value reported so far from genome-wide data, suggesting that purifying selection against mildly deleterious non-synonymous variants is less effective in C. nigra than in most living species. As compared to published values, our estimate might be slightly inflated by the absence of a reference genome in C. nigra, and the de novo prediction of ORF we performed. However, we note that a similar analysis performed in E. orbicularis did not yield such an elevated π N /π S ratio. Divergence analysis consistently revealed a high d N /d S ratio in C. nigra., similar to the one reported in human (  Figure 1 ,  Table 3 ). The analysis of flanking regions also revealed a reduced efficiency of purifying selection as compared to E. orbicularis. Therefore, for all the population genomic indicators we considered, C. nigra showed the expected characteristics of a low-population sized species, that is, a reduced amount of genetic diversity and a weakened efficiency of selective effects. This is consistent with the idea that C. nigra has experienced a reduced long-term N e as a consequence of its isolation in a restricted geographic area  [14] . This result, if confirmed from other case studies, would make island endemic species a promising model for the analysis of the N e effect on genome evolution. Besides the variable we examined in this study, one may think to investigate, for example, the complexity of the transcriptome, proteome and interactome in island vs. mainland species, to test the suggestion that these features primarily evolve through the long-term accumulation of neutral or slightly deleterious elements and interactions  [9] . From a conservation point of view, the report of a small long-term N e and of elevated π N /π S and d N /d S ratio suggests that the giant Galápagos tortoise suffers from a particularly heavy load of deleterious mutations, both fixed and polymorphic, as compared to the other turtles of this study. This might be a matter of worry. However, our own species, H. sapiens, is similarly affected by a substantial load of deleterious mutations  [32] , which have apparently not hampered its ecological success. Obviously, the giant Galápagos tortoise deserves to be protected irrespective of its level of genetic diversity and mutation load. Our data did not reveal any departure from panmixy in C. nigra. No nuclear population structure between the two sampled mitochondrial lineages was found, and no significant excess of individual homozygosity was detected. This result is in apparent contradiction with the report of significant amounts of genetic differentiation between numerous pairs of C. nigra populations, based on a much larger sample of tortoises and 10 microsatellite loci  [33] . The two studies are very different in terms of locus sampling, population sampling, and data type, and more data and analyses would be required to identify the reasons for this discrepancy. We note that the E. orbicularis analysis revealed a substantial excess of homozygosity and significant F ST between populations, suggesting that our approach has some power to detect population differentiation when effective. At any rate, the lack of genetic differentiation genome-wide that we report between entities that recently reached species level  [34]  calls for a re-examination of the taxonomy in this group. 
 Functional population transcriptomics The McDonald-Kreitman approach did not reveal any evidence for adaptive amino-acid substitution in the C. nigra lineage. The π N /π S ratio was higher than the d N /d S ratio, and this was still true after low-frequency variants were accounted for. This negative result, however, might be explained by a recent drop of N e in C. nigra, which would have inflated the π N /π S ratio to a value well above its average level during the divergence between C. carbonaria and C. nigra. A global analysis of gene expression level did not reveal any specific pattern in the C. nigra lineage, in which the global rate of gene expression evolution did not appear to be accelerated, as compared to other turtle species. We note that these results about gene expression levels should be taken with caution because the physiological state of the sampled individuals was not properly controlled, and probably very different between species -for instance, E. orbicularis individuals were caught from the wild, whereas C. nigra individuals were sampled in zoos. The GO-term specific π N /π S analysis we conducted identified four terms for which the π N /π S ratio is significantly higher in C. nigra than in E. orbicularis relative to the genomic average, that is, evidence for relaxed selective pressure in the Galápagos tortoise (  Figure 5 , Additional file 3:  Table S1 ). These terms correspond to basic metabolic functions of the cell, including 'translation' and 'RNA metabolic process'. We note that RNA translation is amongst the most energy-consuming cellular functions. The increased amount of functional constraint on these genes in E. orbicularis might be related to the necessity of substantial energetic savings in this temperate species, which enters into a deep hypometabolic state during wintering  [35, 36] . Two GO-slim terms, on the other hand, yielded evidence for reduced relative π N /π S ratio in C. nigra, namely 'immune system process' and 'response to stress'. 'Immune system process' is the only GO-slim term for which the C. nigra average (0.22) is below the E. orbicularis one (0.36). A high non-synonymous to synonymous ratio in immunity genes is typical and interpreted as reflecting the effect of balancing selection, that is, a selective force favoring the diversity of pathogen-responding alleles. Observing a relatively low π N /π value for immunity genes in C. nigra is therefore suggestive of a reduced pathogenic/parasitic diversity in this insular species. This is in agreement with the hypothesis of a shift from antibody-mediated, acquired immunity to cell-mediated, innate immunity in insular species  [37] . 'Response to stress' is the other GO-slim term for which a significant reduction in π N /π S ratio was detected in C. nigra, most likely reflecting an increased selective constraint on these genes in the giant Galápagos tortoise. Seven of the 31C. nigra coding sequences associated to this category have homologues that encode for heat-shock proteins (for example, dnaJ), that is, chaperone proteins involved in the response to various kinds of environmental stress, such as temperature, infection, and starvation, among others (Additional file 4:  Table S2 ). This might be related to the highly fluctuating climate of the Galápagos Islands, and the long, recurrent periods of aridity that animals must face  [38] . Besides heat-shock proteins, a majority of the C. nigra coding sequences associated to the 'response to stress' term have homologues related to the control of oxidative stress (for example, peroxydase), DNA replication/repair (for example, photolyase), and apoptosis (for example, bcl2-associated transcription factor, Additional file 4:  Table S2 ), that is, functions that have been linked to the regulation of ageing and longevity  [39] . Our results suggest that the giant Galápagos tortoises, which can live well above 100 years in a warm, mutagenic environment, are undergoing a particularly strong selective pressure with respect to the management of oxidative molecular species and DNA damage. 
 Conclusions Our analyses of transcriptomic diversity in C. nigra revealed that molecular evolution in the giant Galápagos tortoise is strongly influenced by an increased rate of genetic drift, which weakens the efficiency of natural selection and creates a substantial mutation load. The relaxation of purifying selection affects most genes, regulatory regions, and functions, with the exception of genes involved in response to stress, on which selective pressure has been reinforced, presumably in response to the new environmental conditions and elongated life span in this species. This study points to insular species as a promising model to explore further the effect of genetic drift on genomic patterns, and its relationship with gene function and adaptation. 
 Material and methods 
 Sampling and sequencing Blood from five adult C. nigra, one C. carbonaria and one M. leprosa individuals were sampled from public European zoological collections (  Table 1 ). The sampling and animal handling have been done by veterinarians and staff of the Montpellier Zoo, Zurich Zoo, Rotterdam Zoo, and A Cupulatta Zoo according to the Code of Practice and Code of Ethics established by the European Association of Zoos and Aquarias. RNA was extracted and cDNA libraries were sequenced using Genome Analyzer II (Illumina®, see Additional file 2). Sequence reads were deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive database as bioproject PRJNA230239, biosample accession SRS509366-SRS509372 (see  Table 1 ). 
 Transcriptome assembly and genotype calling Contigs (predicted cDNAs) were assembled following reference  [40] . Illumina reads were mapped to the contigs using BWA  [41] . In C. nigra, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genotypes were called using the method described in reference  [42] . Dubious SNPs potentially resulting from hidden paralogy were cleaned using the method introduced in reference  [22] . This method calculates the likelihood under a two-locus model (that is, assuming that two distinct genes have contributed reads which were erroneously assembled in a single contig), and discard SNPs that reveal a significant increase in likelihood, as compared to the one-locus model. Two stringency levels were tried in this analysis: stringent (likelihood ratio test P value <0.01) and very stringent (likelihood ratio test P value <0.05). 
 Polymorphism analysis For each ORF, the following statistics were calculated: per-site synonymous (π S ) and non-synonymous (π N ) diversity in C. nigra, per-individual heterozygosity, overall heterozygote deficiency (F IT ), number of synonymous (p S ) and non-synonymous (p N ) segregating sites in C. nigra, number of synonymous (d S ) and non-synonymous (d S ) fixed differences between C. nigra and C. carbonaria, neutrality index NI = (p N /p S )/(d N /d S ), neutrality index calculated after removing SNPs for which the minor allele frequency was below 0.2 (NI 0.2 ), estimated fraction of adaptive amino-acid substitutions α = 1-NI, and its corrected version α 0.2 = 1-NI 0.2 . An additional estimate of α, called α EWK , was calculated according to a method based on the inferred site frequency spectrum  [29] , that is, the distribution of minor allele frequency across SNPs. A similar analysis was conducted in the European pond turtle E. orbicularis based on a sample of 10 individuals, using the pond slider T. scripta as outgroup, reproducing a previously published analysis  [22] . In both C. nigra and E. orbicularis, we extracted 5′ and 3′ UTR sequences from contigs in which a start and/or a stop codon had been recovered. UTR sequences of length 50 bp or more available in at least four (C. nigra) or eight (E. orbicularis) individuals were selected. UTR sequence polymorphism was estimated using the nucleotide diversity index, separately averaged across 5′ UTR and 3′ UTR sequences. 
 Gene ontology analysis The generic GO-slim ontology  [23]  was used to explore the distribution of the π N /π S ratio across functional categories of genes in C. nigra vs. E. orbicularis, in search for gene sets showing a specific increase/decrease of selective pressure in one of the two species. GO-slim is a contracted version of the Gene Ontology database including a relatively small number of high-level, little-overlapping terms. A term-averaged log-transformed π N /π S ratio was calculated for each species and each term, and compared between species. A resampling procedure was designed to quantify, for each term, the significance of the normalized difference in π N /π S ratio between the two species (see Additional file 2).

 Keywords 
 Introduction The earth's climate is changing in response to several human activities which markedly contribute to global climate changes  (Pachauri and Reisinger 2007) . Agriculture, forestry, and other land uses are responsible for approximately 25 % of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mainly from deforestation and agricultural emissions  (Bustamante et al. 2014; IPCC 2014) . Over the last century, there have been consistent increases in CO 2 emissions which led to an increase in global mean temperature of 0.74°C, and this is projected to continue at a pace between 0.15 and 0.3°C per decade, based on the emission scenario  (IPCC 2007; Watson 2001) . By the end of the twenty-first century, temperature is projected to rise by 3.4°C while atmospheric CO 2 concentration will be almost four times higher than that of today  (Pachauri and Reisinger 2007; IPCC 2014) . Such a scenario raises questions on the sustainability of current cropping systems which are likely to be impacted under climate change. Concomitantly, global food production must increase by 50 % to meet the projected demand of the world's population by 2050  (Chakraborty and Newton 2011; Foley et al. 2011) . This difficult challenge is further complicated by climate change which influences the distribution of crop pests (i.e., insects, pathogens, and weeds) and disease severity. Although pest management has played an important role in the marked rise in food production in the last 50 years  (Oerke 2006) , most existing management strategies have been based on the indiscriminate use of pesticides in agriculture. Increasing awareness of health and environmental issues as well as increasingly stringent legislation on pesticide use, particularly in the European Union (EU), pose a particular compounded challenge to twenty-first century agriculture. EU agriculture needs to meet food demands, satisfy sustainability goals, and adapt to climate change. Indeed, maintaining, or even increasing, crop yield while simultaneously reducing reliance on pesticides represents a challenging task  (Hossard et al. 2014 ) that is further complicated against the background of climate change scenarios. In the current situation, two factors increase the risk of potential pest pressure in agriculture. While increasing anthropogenic impact, in particular increasing global movement of people and trade of plant commodities, continues to lead to the introduction of exotic pests into new regions  (Fig. 1) , climate change provides suitable conditions for such pests to adapt across the areas which were previously detrimental for their survival  (Chakraborty 2013; Fletcher et al. 2010) . In this way, climate change further accelerates pest pressure both in space and time and may have dramatic consequences throughout specific regions of the globe. In some regions, excessively dry, wet, or warm conditions may directly hamper crop production and consequently current crop protection methods may become ineffective  (Chakraborty and Newton 2011) . Recent examples of pest adaptation to warmer temperatures (see below) have given rise to escalating disease epidemics in new areas where, in retrospect, the current cropping systems are excessively vulnerable to unforeseen threats. Even less direct effects, such as changes in crop or pest phenology can also have significant consequences in plant production. Crop losses due to pests can account of up to more than 40 % worldwide  (Oerke 2006) . These values might significantly rise under changing climatic conditions whereby new and more aggressive pests affect levels and stability of crop yield thereby threatening food security. However, it is not possible to make estimates on overall potential crop losses due to climate change. This is in part because of the unpredictable adaptation of certain pests to a changing environment which creates situations of uncertainty  (Chakraborty and Newton 2011) . Indeed, the main consequence of climate change and accelerated globalization is a heightened level of unpredictability regarding spatial and temporal interactions between weather, cropping systems, and pests  (Chakraborty 2013) . This is the ongoing crop protection challenge that farmers, advisers, researchers, and policy makers face. In light of this, the reduction of pest impact has become more relevant than ever not only to produce sufficient food and agricultural commodities but also to reduce excessive input and unnecessary CO 2 emissions. Interactions between the changing environment, crops, cropping systems, and pests demand a new multi-disciplinary and integrative knowledge base for the development of viable adaptive strategies. The capacity to adapt is needed to reduce the impact of both invasive alien species as well as rapidly evolving resident pest populations  (Chakraborty 2013; Roy et al. 2014) . Here, we contend that anticipatory strategies, enhanced adaptation capacity, and the development of more resilient cropping systems require new insights and innovative organizational change. Because this paper is the fruit of collaborations among several European partners, we will mainly focus on scenarios of climate change and pest evolution within European contexts. Our objective is to identify relevant research needs and policy implications in order to understand how cropping systems and integrated pest management (IPM) strategies can be designed to better deal with invasive as well as existing but evolving pest populations under climate change in Europe. In particular, we use two major approaches. For emerging invasive alien pests that, should they evade biosecurity measures, are likely to become established, we seek approaches to reduce their impact, while for indigenous pests, we seek prevention, escape, or control strategies to manage plant-pest evolutionary processes. 
 Policy and regulatory issues related to climate change scenarios Climate change is increasingly recognized as a considerable risk to agriculture in the European Union, in particular with respect to direct impacts on crop production and the stability of yields. It is becoming increasingly central within the European policy agenda, mainly with respect to EU food security. Potential adaptation of existing pest populations to new environments, as well as exotic incursions of new, betteradapted pest genotypes or species, will further add to the lack of predictability and stability of current cropping systems. However, indirect losses in cropping systems due to climate change, through the probable changing impact of pest and diseases, have received very little attention or recognition compared to human or animal health issues. In order to reduce crop losses due to either invasive or rapidly evolving resident pests under changing climate, the further integration of the roles of plant health and crop protection specialists for the creation of more resilient cropping systems appears increasingly relevant. Such recognition, although still rather tentative and subject to further policy integration and elaboration, is consistent within the framework of adaptive strategy needs as outlined in the European Commission White Paper, adapting to climate change: towards a European framework for action (COM(2009) 147/4) (European Commission 2009a). Nevertheless, specific actions remain to be outlined. The impact of climate change, globalization, and increased intra-community movement on the introduction and spread of invasive alien and existing pests, respectively, is considered as one of the central concerns of the current revision of the Common Plant Health Regime (http://ec.europa.eu/food/ plant/strategy/index_en.htm). In particular, there is an emphasis on the sustainability with regard to the potential increased pressures on cropping systems and yields and overall food security. Recent and potentially future legislation responding to increasingly stringent environmental and human health concerns-for example, Regulation (EC)  No. 1107 (European Commission 2009b  and Directive 2009/128/EC (commonly referred to as the Framework Directive) (European Commission 2009c) and their respective implications-while fuelling innovation toward environmental and health sustainability may add further practical and operational challenges with regard to maintaining the same level of crop yields. It is unclear, however, how both pest evolution and legislative scenarios will be  Fig. 1  South American tomato moth (Tuta absoluta) and the damage it causes on tomato. This pest arrived in Europe (Spain) in 2006 and rapidly spread in Afro-Eurasia  (Desneux et al. 2011) . It is currently widespread throughout most European countries changed in the coming future given the uncertainty on their medium-and longer-term individual and interactive impacts. Of equal concern is also their possible impact on cropping system resilience and the capacity to adapt. 
 Pest evolution under climate change Plausible estimates of climate change impacts require combined use of climate, crops, pests, and economic models. However, climate change models often ignore possible effects on dynamics and infectivity of pests and diseases. The most important reason is that we do not have long-term monitoring data or an empirical approach to feed modeling systems that might be used to predict impacts and mitigation scenarios with sufficient levels of certainty  (Scherm 2004; Shaw and Osborne 2011) . In addition, this pattern of climate change factors is not equally distributed over the globe. It is anticipated that a general shift of a milder climate toward the poles will improve the potential of crop production  Evans et al. 2008) . By contrast, hotter and drier conditions in many already semi-arid areas of the world will limit the possibilities for agriculture  (Luo et al. 2009 ). Therefore, it is unlikely that general models can ever be developed. However, it is worth noting that all climate models predict a higher frequency of extreme and fluctuating weather conditions which would influence the interactions between crops, pests, and diseases in an unpredictable way. As a consequence, there may be increasing risk of complete failure of current and possibly future crop protection strategies. Climate change is generally associated with increased CO 2 levels, higher seasonal temperature profiles, and more precipitation  (Pachauri and Reisinger 2007) . These global climate change effects will affect the distribution of pests, although whether such changes will cause more frequent and more severe outbreaks cannot be answered in general terms. The fertilization effect of higher CO 2 levels might increase photosynthesis and crop yields  (Ainsworth and Long 2005) . However, it is widely considered to also affect plant morphology, canopy structure, and hence micro-climate and the resident micro-floral populations in such environments  (Eastburn et al. 2011) . Thus far, different studies have given conflicting results showing that elevated CO 2 levels may have negative, neutral, or positive effects on fungal growth  (Luck et al. 2011) . Indeed, the Climapest project, covering 20 different crops throughout Brazil, concluded that climate change can ""decrease, increase, or have no impact on plant diseases, pests, or weeds depending on the region and the time period"" (http://www. macroprograma1.cnptia.embrapa.br/climapest/englishversion). For example, experiments showed that in an environment with higher CO 2 level, some rust-caused diseases seemed to increase while others decreased in severity  (Ghini et al. 2011 ). The effects of temperature change are manifold and will affect crops and plant diseases in many different direct and indirect ways. For example, a 5.8°C increase in temperature is expected to reduce suitable coffee-growing areas by more than 95 % in several regions of Brazil  (Assad et al. 2004) . Higher temperatures are often associated with increased rates of development, growth, and reproduction and hence the fear that plant diseases will become more severe makes intuitive sense. Warmer climate crops, such as those found in the tropics, tend to suffer greater pest problems than crops in more temperate regions. Yet, it is not easy to predict which combinations of crops and pests will tend to become problematic in the future and in which areas  (Shaw and Osborne 2011) . On the other hand, higher levels of precipitation in certain areas could be useful for plant growth, although rainfall and moisture are also vital for the occurrence of fungal and bacterial species  (Huber and Gillespie 1992) . Infection, sporulation, and spread of many fungi are moisture-dependent, and outbreaks are often triggered by long periods of wetness  (Juroszek and von Tiedemann 2011) . The body of knowledge on the effects of climate change, new exotic pest incursions, and globalization on crop protection points to a higher level of unpredictability regarding future crop-pest-climate interactions and increased frequency and amplitude of climatic fluctuations. Overall, there will be accelerations in the rate of exotic pests entering and establishing in Europe as well as an increased rate of evolution of existing pest populations. In such situations, the priority may shift from maximizing yields to achieving more stable levels of production and avoiding total crop failures. Hence, IPM strategies that are dynamic and internally diversified to locally adapted cropping systems, and more resilient to fluctuating weather conditions and new and evolving pests, should be developed accordingly. A wide range of pests including insects, fungal and bacterial pathogens, and weeds may benefit from changing climate. The way in which climate change impacts their evolution can be summarized as below. 
 Insects Climate and weather patterns are of primary importance for the distribution, development, and population dynamics of insects. Although insects may regulate body temperature within a certain range, many species-especially smaller herbivores-are almost exclusively ectotherms  (Willmer et al. 2000) . Insect physiology is therefore primarily driven by temperature which means that phenology, reproduction, and developmental rates significantly change when populations are exposed to different climatic regimes. Bioclimatic envelopes (the range and pattern of climatic parameters) and day length largely determine the potential distribution of insect species when host plants are available. Insects are constantly adapting their life history patterns to the available climatic regimes or season lengths. Evolutionary adaptations in life cycles of insects occur so rapidly that ongoing climate changes are already reflected in according adaptations such as daylight signals that induce diapause  (Bradshaw and Holzapfel 2011) . Increased pest outbreaks were judged as ""virtually certain"" in the previous IPCC Synthesis Report  (IPCC 2007) , while according to the IPCC Synthesis Report 2014, increases in the frequency or intensity of ecosystem disturbances including pest outbreaks in many parts of the world are in some cases due to climate change (IPCC 2014). Aside from population dynamics per se, current climatic projections predict that the distribution of insect species will shift from lower latitudes pole wards and from lower to higher altitudes (Hadley Centre 2007). Such range shifts in insect distributions have been already observed in nature as a response to global warming  (Battisti et al. 2005; Gutierrez et al. 2009; Parmesan 2006; Walther et al. 2002) . For example, the stinkbug Acrosternum hilare in England and Japan has shifted its range by more than 300 km northward with a temperature increase of only 2°C  (Trumble and Butler 2009) . Likewise, the mountain pine beetle, a major forest pest in the USA and Canada, has extended its range northward by approximately 300 km when temperature rose by only 2°C  (Logan and Powell 2001) . Lower latitudes usually have more complex pest assemblages, i.e., more pest species and antagonists per crop than higher latitudes toward the poles. Climatic shifts are therefore expected to increase the number of harmful species in temperate regions, especially in those of the northern hemisphere  (Logan and Powell 2001; Parmesan 2006) . For example, higher temperatures may extend the distribution range of the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) to maize areas previously free of this species. This may not only lead to crop losses but also to more secondary infections by Fusarium molds and consequent mycotoxin problems in this crop. Pests may also spread or invade into areas and find new host plants that were not infested before. Being the driving factor for establishment in new distribution ranges, global warming may also increase the traveling speed of invasive pests by decreasing the function of mountain ranges as cold barriers  (Aluja et al. 2011) . Climate change will lead also to phenological changes. The earlier onset and increased length of the growing season also means that indigenous polyvoltine species may be able to complete more generations per year leading to higher population levels at the season's end  (Ziter et al. 2012) . In this way, formerly univoltine species may also become bi-or multivoltine as reported for codling moth (Cydia pomonella L.), a key pest in apple throughout several parts of Europe  (Stoeckli et al. 2012) . Shifts in phenology due to changing temperatures may also change the synchrony between host plants, pest species, and their natural enemies. This may lead to unexpected interactions the outcome of which, in terms of more or less damage, is hard to predict. Furthermore, invasive species may have more opportunity to become established in areas that were formerly unsuitable as a habitat due to the climatic conditions  (Trumble and Butler 2009) . Besides higher population pressure, the potential for damage is expected to last longer within the growing season and crops will have to be protected accordingly. Established management strategies that are focused on low pesticide residues will have to be largely adapted to avoid the possible resistance build-up to plant protection chemicals thereby ensuring their sustainability in future use  (Samietz et al. 2014 ). Here, further knowledge about pest biology, especially the potential adaptation of insect pests to climatic changes, is necessary and needs to be combined in simulation studies in order to prepare management systems that can withstand the challenges of global warming. Besides higher temperatures during the growing season, elevated winter temperatures are equally significant. The distribution of many species is limited by their low-temperature tolerance. Given milder winters under climate change, more species will be able to survive and colonize crops. Some species may skip their sexual stage and have new asexual generations throughout the year which may lead to early high population levels. There are a number of instances worldwide where aphids have shifted from holocyclic (primary and secondary hosts) to anholocyclic (only secondary hosts, i.e., only the crop plants) form  (Radcliffe and Ragsdale 2002) . Such a shifting process in insect phenology is likely to have an impact on crops and increase pest management costs. An example of altered aphid phenology comes from Scotland whereby oilseed rape production was introduced with farmers growing vernalized oil seed rape (autumn planted with the crop remaining green during the winter). It was found that green peach aphids could overwinter as anholocyclic forms (asexual generations) on oilseed rape and colonize potato earlier than those aphids that overwintered on the primary host  (Fenton et al. 1998; Woodford 1998) . If increased temperatures allow aphids to remain on secondary hosts (either crop or non-crop), this can result in rapid colonization of crops early in the season. The phenology of pests will also be modified by increased temperatures. A 20-year study in the UK demonstrated that winter temperature was the dominant factor affecting aphid phenology and that a mere 1°C rise in winter temperature advanced the migration phenology by 19 days  (Zhou et al. 1995) . Overall, higher temperatures would allow insect populations to colonize crops earlier and develop faster. In this way, crop damage may occur more rapidly than what is currently observed. Finally, as some of these insect species are also vectors of viruses (such as Bemisia tabaci), crops may also become more vulnerable due to earlier and more severe infections. Besides temperature, elevated CO 2 levels were reported to favor insect population growth rates, such as those for pea aphids, by active elicitations of host responses that promote amino acid metabolism in both the host plant and its bacteriocytes  (Guo et al. 2013 ). In addition, rising CO 2 levels will increase the carbon-nitrogen balance in crop plants and hence their structure and palatability for leaf chewing insects. Each species may respond differently to all these changes, and this will affect concentrations of constitutive and induced defensive chemicals in plants, insect feeding behavior, competition between pests, interactions among pests and natural enemies, and ultimately damage to crops  (Trumble and Butler 2009) . However, our current knowledge on these aspects remains largely fragmentary. Over recent decades, there has been constant growth in the number of reports of invasive alien species reaching new areas  (Trumble and Butler 2009) . Invasions are primarily due to increasing anthropogenic impacts at global level, i.e., the increasing and rapid movement of people and agricultural commodities. However, warmer temperatures also mean that insects which could not previously survive in potential new areas are able to establish and colonize once introduced. A practical example is the potato psyllid (Bactericera cockerelli) which has migrated to California several times over the past century with the populations never lasting more than a year. Cool winter temperatures meant it could only survive in Mexico and southern Texas during this period of the year. However, in 2000, it became established in California inducing substantial losses in tomato, potato, and pepper crops  (Liu and Trumble 2007) . New emerging species often spread into completely new ecological settings where most of their natural enemies are missing. An example is the introduction of the B-biotype (B. tabaci) in Brazil which was responsible of vectoring of viruses present in native plants only onto cultured tomato crops, leading to new virus diseases in this crop  (Fernandes et al. 2008) . Whether antagonists will also extend their ranges, thereby following the herbivores, is unknown for the moment. This is true especially in the case of introduction via globalization/international trade rather than the mere extension of an area of distribution via climate change. In-depth ecological knowledge about both pests and their natural enemies in the country of origin may help toward better preparedness and to develop more robust cropping systems. This may apply to both already introduced pests and vectored diseases such as Tuta absoluta  (Desneux et al. 2010; Zappalà et al. 2013) , B. tabaci  (Tahiri et al. 2006) , tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), Plutella xylostella, and its parasitoids  (Sarfraz et al. 2005) , and to potential invasive species such as Bactrocera fruit flies  (Stephens et al. 2007 ). Robust cropping systems were already developed and tested in the tropics against a range of such pests  (Licciardi et al. 2008; Vayssieres et al. 2009 ). 
 Fungi Plant disease outbreaks depend on complex interactions between many factors. Overall, the development of an aggressive strain within a diverse population, the presence of host plants missing appropriate resistance to this newly developed aggressive strain, plant architecture, uniform cropping system, weather conditions, and limited antagonistic activities of nonpathogenic populations play an important and inter-related role  Burdon et al. 2006; Garrett et al. 2011; Jones and Barbetti 2012; Pangga et al. 2013) . The mode of nutrition also has a non-negligible role. For example, biotrophic fungi deriving nutrition only from living host tissue are more successfully controlled than necrotrophs which derive nutrition from both live and dead plant materials  (Beed et al. 2011) . Taking all these factors together, it is hard to speculate on the effects of climate change, particularly when long-term datasets from the past are missing to develop and test predictive models for the future. Nevertheless, our knowledge of the phenology of plant-disease interactions, population genetics of pathogens as well as crops, and examples of overwhelming establishment of new diseases in a region provides insights into how climate change may affect disease incidence and severity as summarized below. Firstly, some features of climate change will influence disease phenology. Higher temperatures and/or elevated CO 2 will speed up the life cycle of some pathogenic fungi thereby increasing the development and availability of inoculum. The latter of which may lead to high levels of infection and accelerated evolution of new aggressive strains  (Chakraborty and Dutta 2003) . Hence, crop protection practices must be timely, effective, precise, and complete to prevent a new wave of infection that leads to new disease epidemics due to overcoming crop resistance. Prolonged generations of pests will be able to infect crops at a later stage than at present. An example is Phoma which is estimated to cause a 10-50 % decrease in the total yield of oilseed rape in the UK depending on future climate conditions . Climate change was also reported to alter crop anthesis. For example, wheat in the UK will be developed earlier in the season being more favorable for Fusarium ear blight infection and consequent mycotoxins increases in cereal products  (Madgwick et al. 2011) . Secondly, climate change may affect the expression of plant resistance traits in a positive or negative way. Breeding for resistance is a lengthy process, and today's resistant varieties are specifically bred for present agricultural conditions. The expression of quantitative resistance against Phoma in oilseed rape dropped dramatically when there was an increase in temperature from 20 to 25°C  (Huang et al. 2009 ). Indeed, the authors showed that the percentage of leaf area infected increased from 5 to 50 %. Taken together, the expression of resistance genes in the host plant, and their efficacy, may decrease dramatically because of climate change. In addition, we could envisage that increased generation cycles of pests triggered by climate change might select more aggressive pathogen populations  (Chakraborty 2013) . Such a selected population, combined with hampered resistance in the host, may lead to unpredicted, or unprecedented, epidemiological outbreaks. Thirdly, when the genetic variation of a crop is low, particularly over a wide range, and continued series of cultivation, a new or adapted strain of a pathogen may arise and become dominant thereby leading to dramatic effects  (Strange and Scott 2005) . A classic example is wheat production in the Central, West Asian, and North African regions which feeds more than one billion people. Although many wheat varieties are grown in this huge area, all have a similar genetic background. With a slightly increased temperature and decreased rainfall, as observed over recent decades, a new type of yellow rust caused by Puccinia striiformis  (Hovmøller et al. 2011)  was able to extend from Africa to India within 15 years. This has led to widespread epidemics highlighting how vulnerable an area can be when slight changes in climate occur  (Wellings 2011) . Indeed, it was reported that new strains of the fungus have adapted to produce spores at warmer temperatures than usual for this pathogen. This may have probably increased the rate of disease expansion on a global scale  (Milus et al. 2009 ). The new strain of P. striiformis  (Fig. 2 ) spreads to at least three new continents within 3 years, faster than previously reported for any crop pathogen  (Hovmøller et al. 2008 ). This gave rise to severe epidemics in warmer wheat production areas  (Hovmøller et al. 2010)  where yellow rust was previously absent or infrequent, implying that current cropping systems were not prepared for the new situation. At a temperature regime typical for these areas, isolates of the new strain produced three to four times more spores per day than strains found previously  (Hovmøller et al. 2011) . The rapid spread of the new strain is probably the cumulative result of increased pathogen fitness, warmer environments, increase in the number of spores in the atmosphere, and long-distance dispersal of these by wind, increasing travel and commerce. Similar chains of events should be expected for other pathogens reinforcing the need for coordinated international surveillance (including long-range surveillance) and action to ensure sustainable crop disease management under climate change. Another example of increasing pathogen proliferation and disease outbreaks is the case of oomycete Phytopthora spp. Root rot and canker disease caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi affects more than 1000 host species, especially in most temperate and subtropical areas of the globe  (Sturrock et al. 2011) . Under climate change, this pathogen was reported to increase the instability and vulnerability of forest ecosystems by a shift toward central Europe  (Jung 2009 ). Increasing temperatures were predicted to boost potential range expansion of P. cinnamomi along the western coast of Europe up to a few hundred kilometers eastward from the Atlantic coast within one century  (Bergot et al. 2004 ). Likewise, Phytophthora ramorum, a pathogen of yet unknown origin, and not reported in Europe until the late 1990s, has rapidly established itself as a major threat to a range of plant species here. Within the last 15 years, over 20 different species of broad-leaved trees were found to be infected throughout southern England  (Webber 2008) . Since autumn 2009, several dramatic outbreaks of the disease caused by this pathogen have been reported across the UK on several new host species  Webber et al. 2010 ). Thanks to the introduction of new horticultural plant species in Europe (such as rhododendron), and altered weather conditions with humid summers and milder winters, this pathogen was not only able to cross the ocean (which it probably had done previously) but was also able to finally establish itself throughout most European regions. Today, this fungal pathogen is widely considered as endemic in Europe, infecting an increasing range of other host plants. Climate change scenarios based on CLIMEX model (that describes the response of a species to climate) projected that the area favorable, or very favorable, for P. ramorum will markedly decrease in the eastern USA but will increase in the west-coast states of Washington, Oregon, and California  (Venette 2009; Venette and Cohen 2006) . Numerous other examples of shift in fungal pathogens and disease outbreaks associated to changing climate were recently reviewed  (Sturrock et al. 2011) . Besides changes in host-pathogen interactions, climate change leads to other changes including fecundity, canopy size, and long-and short-distance disseminations  (Chakraborty 2013) . Changes in the geographical distribution of hosts and pathogens, new pathogens, new remnant vegetation, and increased plant stress will all be important issues in the development of fungal diseases in changing climatic conditions. The complex interplay of changing resistance Several examples of fungal pathogen adaptation under climate change have been reported in the literature. Those include the substitution of species in the genus Fusarium and Microdochium spp. in Europe by Fusarium pseudograminearum with higher temperature optima and toxigenicity  (Isebaert et al. 2009 ). This replacement has led to the increased risk of mycotoxin contamination  (Paterson and Lima 2010) . Similar example was reported also from Canada where adaptive evolution along environmental gradients has replaced existing Fusarium graminearum population with highly toxigenic forms  (Ward et al. 2008 ). In eastern USA, an aggressive high-temperature-tolerant strain has dominated stripe rust pathogen, P. striiformis f. sp. tritici, population since 2000  (Milus et al. 2009 ). As effects of climate change on fungal diseases are challenging to predict in general terms, a practical method might be detailed through modeling of each individual croppathogen situation in a projected climate change condition of a certain geographic area. Looking at north-west Europe with predicted warmer and more humid winters, and warmer and drier summers, polycyclic and monocyclic fungi can be classified in seven ""ecotypes"" ). This classification can be based on parameters such as dissemination method of spores, infection condition requirements, and latent period to weather conditions . Being classified in a specific ecotype, one can predict if climate change in that region will support an increased or a decreased infection of a certain fungus-crop combination. This methodology might be useful to test in other regions of Europe. 
 Bacteria In a globalized world and under climate change conditions, plant pathogenic bacteria are expected to become an increasing threat to crop health  (Jones and Barbetti 2012) . Firstly, apparently healthy but latently infected woody plants  (Lamichhane 2014; Lamichhane et al. 2014 ) highly favor the long-distance dissemination of plant pathogenic bacteria through global trade of nursery materials. This often leads to new disease outbreaks throughout the range of cultivation. Secondly, new strains emerge from warmer regions and easily adapt to our more temperate regions. A telling example in Europe can be found in potato crops where diseases caused by Pectobacterium spp. were always predominant. However, over the past decade Dickeya spp. have taken over  (Czajkowski et al. 2011 ). The latter, previously identified as pathogens from tropical and subtropical regions, have become established in Europe due to today's milder climatic conditions. Dickeya spp. are more aggressive than Pectobacterium spp. and are now responsible for 50 to 100 % of field infections thereby leading to significant damage in potato and other crops across Europe  (Czajkowski et al. 2011) . European horse chestnut bleeding canker caused by Pseudomonas syringe represents another pertinent example  (Fig. 3) . Although this pathogen was reported to cause mild disease symptoms on a local horse chestnut species from India during the 1980s  (Durgapal and Singh 1980) , the pathogen was never reported in Europe. However, in 2002, an aggressive population of P. syringae was found on European horse chestnut in the Netherlands which, since, has rapidly established itself as a major threat to this tree throughout a large number of North-western European countries (reviewed by  Lamichhane et al. 2014) . Similarly, an aggressive population of P. syringae has jeopardized the entire kiwifruit industry at global level causing severe economic losses  (Bartoli et al 2014; Lamichhane et al. 2014) . In this last case, global trade of infected plant materials and the cultivation of genetically uniform plant species were considered as the major means that favored pathogen dissemination. Another example of bacterial pathogen evolution under climate change includes race 9 of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae infecting rice with the Xa7 resistance gene increased virulence and aggressiveness over 11 years of rising temperature to dominate the pathogen population (Webb et al. 2011). However, in this case, the increased effectiveness of Xa7 at high temperature has continued to offer effective pathogen control. 
 Fig. 3 Horse chestnut bleeding canker caused by the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae which leads to rapid tree death As climate change might enhance threats from plant pathogenic bacteria, it is important to realize that bacteria might behave as ""kingdom hoppers"" moving from human to animal to plant to environment and vice versa. These phenomena have raised several concerns. Recent evidence has confirmed that human pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria and viruses can colonize and infect plants as alternate hosts  (Holden et al. 2009 ). The causal agent of nosocomial infections in humans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa  (Mesaros et al. 2007) , is reported to cause new diseases on naturally grown tobacco  (Yu et al. 2008 ) and causes fruit rot of Tinda  (Mondal et al. 2012) . Similarly, Salmonella enteric typhimurium internally colonizes tomato  (Gu et al. 2013;  as well as lettuce  (Klerks et al. 2007)  plants. On tomato, S. enterica has been reported to move systemically reaching fruits and seeds from leaves  (Gu et al. 2011) . Once within the fruits, the pathogen can multiply to high densities  (Gu et al. 2011; Noel et al. 2010) . A recent study demonstrated that Escherichia coli can internally colonize both leaves and roots of lettuce and spinach  (Wright et al. 2013) . Lastly, human norovirus and norovirus surrogates (Murine norovirus and Tulane virus) are also reported to colonize spinach stem and leaves  (Hirneisen and Kniel 2013) . Because virulence effector genes can be frequently exchanged or transferred between bacteria (Baltrus 2013), such ""kingdom hopping"" events represent a real threat thereby raising several concerns also for human and animal, not least plant health. Recently, it had been reviewed that bacterial species, especially those belonging to the large family of Enterobacteriaceae, can easily be adapted in human, animal, and plant environments. Horizontal gene transfer  (Baltrus 2013)  between species can easily occur in a joint habitat such as the soil/manure/plant-rhizosphere interphase, which might confer an enhanced fitness to bacteria to live on plant as well as human hosts. In analogy to zoonosis (bacteria transmitted from animal to human), this new class of plant bacteria is termed ""phytonosis""  (Van Overbeek et al. 2014 ). One of the most important threats of phytonosic bacteria are acquired genes for antibiotic resistance  (Lipsitch et al. 2002) , known for being abundantly present in the bacterial community of the plant rhizosphere. 
 Weeds Overall, invasive plants have been shown to severely affect plant communities. A recent meta-analysis estimated that invasive plants reduced fitness of native plant communities on average by 41.7 %, growth by 22.1 %, species abundance by 43.5 %, and diversity by 50.7 %  (Vilà et al. 2011) . More specifically to crops, weeds compete with them for light, nutrients, and water. It is likely that the effect of environmental disturbances such as rising CO 2 or increasing temperatures will be manifested as a change in the competitiveness between crops and weeds. Herbicide performance is also expected to reduce at elevated CO 2 levels  (Ziska 2010) . Being inherently adapted to the prevailing conditions, it is likely that weeds will respond more favorably to climate change than crops. This has been confirmed in the majority of studies examining the response of crops and weeds to increasing levels of CO 2 . However, the physiological characteristics of crops and weeds being either a C 3 or C 4 plant will also determine their respective responses to CO 2  (Hatfield et al. 2011; Ziska 2011) . While CO 2 is mainly expected to influence crop-weed competition, the most likely effect of a rising temperature is the northwards expansion of native and invasive weed species  (Hatfield et al. 2011) . In comparison to many diseases and insect pests, weeds are relatively non-mobile, and their spread and establishment into new regions is expected to take longer than for other pest groups. However, as projected warming may exceed maximum rates of plant migration in postglacial periods  (Malcolm et al. 2002) , it could favor the most mobile weed species. Many agricultural weeds have characteristics associated with long-distance dissemination and a wide geographic range such as small seeds, phenotypic plasticity, and a short juvenile period that suggests that agricultural weeds may be among the fastest to spread  (Dukes and Mooney 2000) . Most of the current information on the impact of climate changes on future weed distribution is based on predictions performed using bioclimatic envelope models  (Hyvönen et al. 2012 ). However, these models have a limited value for predicting the long-term changes in the composition of weed communities  (Thuiller et al. 2008) . Firstly, climatic conditions alone cannot predict range shifts without considering biotic and management practices such as soil type, tillage practice, and cropping sequence. Secondly, the bioclimatic envelope models assume that weed species will only gain foothold in areas that have a climate similar to its native range. However, this assumption has recently been challenged by studies revealing that the range expansion of alien species exceeded that predicted by the models used  (Clements and DiTommaso 2011) . Rapid genetic evolution and/or phenotypic plasticity may explain these observations  (Clements and DiTommaso 2011; Maron et al. 2004) . For an agricultural weed to be successful, it must adapt not only to a given climate but also to the constraints of the cropping system. Thus, the range shift of a weed species should not only be studied in the context of climate but should also include biotic parameters which have rarely been the case so far. The term ""niche"" is often used in the context of range shifts. According to  Hutchinson (1957) , the abiotic factors, and especially climate, determine the fundamental niche of a species while the interactions with the biotic factors together with the dispersal properties determine the realized niche of a species. Although the concepts of fundamental and realized niches are useful also for understanding range shifts of agricultural weeds, they do not take into account the economic impact of agricultural weeds. To overcome this shortcoming,  McDonald et al. (2009)  introduced the concept of the ""damage niche."" The latter is defined as ""the environmental conditions that make specific weed abundant, competitive, and therefore damaging the production of particular crops."" Determining the damage niche of a weed species requires information on the crop-weed interactions and is thus region and cropping system specific. Despite its relevance to the impact of climate change on the distribution and impact of agricultural weeds, the ""damage niche"" concept has only been applied in a few other studies  (Stratonovitch et al. 2012; Bradley 2013) . Using the damage niche-based concept in conjunction with the HadCM3 projections for the periods  2046 -2065 and 2080 -2099 , Stratonovitch et al. (2012  found a possible northward shift in the range of black grass (Alopecurus myosuroides) in winter wheat  (Fig. 4) . Moreover, they also observed a local-scale difference due to variations in soil type and water holding capacity. The competitive balance was predicted to shift in favor of the crop due to its deeper root system making the crop less prone than the competing weed to the more frequent drought stress events predicted. In short, this means, in this context, the damage niche was predicted to reduce, rather than increase, under climate change. 4 Diversification of current plant protection strategies to mitigate climate change effects Current agricultural practices may need to be revisited because of climate change. IPM is a widely used strategy that integrates cultural, biological, and chemical controls to reduce harmful insect populations below a threshold which otherwise will cause economic losses. Because many insects develop more rapidly in response to rising temperatures  (Trumble and Butler 2009) , crop damage could occur more rapidly than expected. In addition, as temperatures increase, the frequency of spring frosts will decline and the resulting extended frostfree periods will increase the duration and intensity of insect outbreaks. Indeed, farmers may be tempted to take advantage of the changing climate by planting crops earlier in the season. However, plants will then be available for insect pests earlier in the annual cycle, allowing populations to get a quicker start and potentially add additional generations during a typical growing season  (Trumble and Butler 2009) . It could translate to increased insect and pathogen pressure at the end of the season, resulting in higher associated yield losses. In some cases, small differences in temperature and humidity can determine the preferred protection strategy. A study in the central valley of California  (Daane and Caltagirone 1989)  showed that an IPM strategy based on the use of parasitoids against the black scale Saissetia oleae could work in the northern part of the valley. In the southern part, however, the slightly warmer and drier conditions were not favorable to the parasitoids. For this reason, the authors recommended heavy pruning in the area to exacerbate the effect of hot and dry conditions on summer mortality of the pest. Indirect effects of climate change may also occur due to shifts in cropping patterns and crop distributions. New combinations of crops may be grown in particular regions and in different growing conditions with changing husbandry practices. If ecological knowledge and farmer experience are lacking for these new situations, unexpected outbreaks may become more frequent or more difficult to manage. Taking into account the uncertainty of local and temporal climate change effects in different regions of the world on plant characteristics and crop production, pest and disease epidemiology, and infection probabilities  (Chakraborty 2013) , designing appropriate and reliable crop protection strategies will be a real challenge. Hence, the possible effects of climate change on pest evolution, as described earlier, raise several questions concerning the consequences for our current crop protection tools and approaches. In particular, can we rely in the future on chemical pesticides as we overwhelmingly do today? And if not, are our current IPM tools suitable to be used in the future? In order to address these questions, we (1) need to study new resistance genes with optimal expression under variable climate change situations; (2) have to collect more data on the behavior of pests, diseases, and weeds in future circumstances and the efficacy of biological control organisms; (3) have to assess the role for alternative plant hosts and intercropping and landscape management for pests, diseases, and weeds as well as for beneficial organisms; and (4) need to develop pest risk analysis models to predict the risk of new invasive pests, their chances of establishment in new cropping areas, and how to counteract disease disasters through local adaptive and resilient cropping and crop protection systems. In other words, all the questions we currently address in order to develop robust Crop protection per se has an important role to play in mitigating climate change. Crop protection practices can contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions. In the UK, arable production systems account for more than 7 % of the total GHG emission  (Carlton et al. 2012) . The authors suggested that conventional crop production systems coupled to reduced tillage is generally the best for producing high yields to minimize GHG emissions and to contribute to global food security. Optimum control of pests is an insurance for optimum exploitation of all other investments in crop production including losses in invested nitrogen, a significant producer of GHG. A quantified example on the fungicide use against diseases of UK oilseed rape showed that yield benefits from fungicide use significantly outweigh GHG emissions associated with production and application of the fungicide. Reduced GHG emissions associated with more efficient use of nitrogen per ton of yield are considerable. For UK wheat, barley, and oilseed rape use, such benefits are >1.5 Mt CO 2 equivalent per year  (Carlton et al. 2012) . Likewise, in forest systems, crop protection practices might be the most important factor in enhancing sequestration of CO 2 by the ""green lungs"" of the world. However, it is surprising that in most climate reports and climate change debates, the role of plant pests and diseases in mitigating the effects of climate change are, at best, only marginally covered. Hence, time has come to elaborate new crop protection strategies that are robust and reliable enough for the challenges of changing climatic conditions and more stringent human and environmental protection. 
 Priorities and action points to improve current plant protection practices Faced with the uncertainty regarding the effects of changing climate on crop protection, and based on the issues discussed, a number of proposed action points, in terms of research needs and the enhanced national and international organization of research and extension effort to help face future challenges, have been identified and are presented here for consideration. While projected changes do not automatically translate into ""doom and gloom"" scenarios, the level of uncertainty is such that policy, research, and extension should be prepared for potential worstcase scenarios or extreme events following a ""no regrets"" approach. Preparation, in turn, should produce increased resilience vis-à-vis pests. This high level of uncertainty should be considered when taking into account models, which are perceived as essential tools to support decision making. This is true for models driven either by weather changes or those tackling exotic pest establishment. The predictive power of modeling on the effects of climate change on pest and disease occurrence is seriously hindered by biotic and abiotic uncertainties. This means that when using model outputs for policy or farm management, this uncertainty should be considered in order to develop flexible responses with the capacity to be continuously adapted and updated with new data and when it comes available. Hereinafter, we list some priorities and recommend actions plans which we feel are required to mitigate climate change effects in future crop protection, particularly in the EU, but also of global relevance. 
 Human resources Historically, agricultural systems have been able to adapt to face major changes involving human resources. For example, 2 to 3 years after the initial arrival of T. absoluta in Europe, there has been a drastic reduction in severity of damage thanks, in large part, to farmers having previous exposure and control experience with other pests which have led to a solid generic understanding and appreciation toward the management and control of the impact of this pest. This was particularly true in areas of Spain that had experienced the earlier invasion and had subsequently developed IPM responses to it. The increased uncertainty and accelerated rate and intensity of disturbances we are now witnessing mean that this capacity for change needs to be pro-actively accelerated. Paradoxically, appropriate expertise and financial support has been declining over the years in several sectors. This can be seen in the area of extension services. The USA's long-term reliance on herbicide-resistant crops, for example, has translated into a reduced number of advisers with weed management skills. Lack of the required expertise can also be seen in other areas of crop protection. Regarding the threat posed by new and significantly more virulent yellow rust strains, for example (although the same could be said of other crop-pathogen systems, e.g., potato), identifying new and more aggressive strains requires highly skilled staff and technical expertise that is generally becoming increasingly less available in European countries. For example, a recent report of the UK parliament highlighted a range of problems in the sector of plant protection (http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/ cmselect/cmenvfru/469/46908.htm). Among them, reduced fund availability and lack of relevant expertise in the field of crop protection, both in terms of the numbers of people and their technical background, have been reported to severely affect prevention-based management. The British Society of Plant Pathology has recently carried out a survey (http://www. bspp.org.uk/society/docs/bspp-plant-pathology-audit-2012. pdf) which highlights problems with the current levels of plant pathology education and training in the UK. Action needs to be taken to reverse the decline in skilled crop protection specialists in Europe. Advisory services currently focus on optimizing existing systems, and, faced with climate change, this approach will have to change in order to concentrate on making systems more resilient. Diversifying cropping systems in general with strategies such as more varied rotations, as recommended for tackling Diabrotica in maize  (Gray et al. 2009 ), can be regarded as major leverage points which can be addressed via extension services. Changes will also be required regarding the role of extension within the innovation process. The involvement of multiple stakeholders, including public-private partnerships, and new, more collective approaches to extension are required to meet the challenges of building more robust cropping systems. One approach which could be usefully employed to address shortcomings in human and financial resources is to join forces across borders, pool resources, and develop new synergistic collaborations for pest management. Examples are EUROWHEAT (http://www.eurowheat.org/EuroWheat.asp) and EUROBLIGHT (http://euroblight.net/about-euroblight/) which are internet-based platforms on diseases of wheat and potato, respectively. These platforms bring together all the information available to date at European level on these pathosystems in order to ensure the ready use of the data. In particular, new disease outbreaks, resistance data are updated on a regular basis to support effective disease control, deployment of host resistances, and breeding programs. Cooperation between the historically compartmentalized experts in plant health and crop protection could help to further draw on shared expertise regarding the anticipation of invasive and alien species and modeling. This is true in particular to understanding the processes leading to establishment of alien species. However, distinctions between invasive species and the emergence of more aggressive strains of existing, indigenous ones may not always be pertinent when considering their spread and impact. Large research groups such as Climapest, which brings together 134 researchers from Brazil and Argentina, and are already working on this issue, could be linked to other groups even though conditions in Europe will differ from those in South America. Another useful avenue is to develop participatory approaches involving new stakeholders and farmers inspired by Web 2.0 and taking advantage of the new technologies which make information exchange easier. This type of approach could, for example, help improve worldwide tracking of global wheat rust (and in real-time). We can look to existing participatory systems as possible models for this approach. Examples are the Finnish web application ""EnviObserver"" and the French ""Ecophyto épidémiosurveillance"" regional networks. The first enables farmers to report pests with mobile phones while the second offers weekly bulletins. It should be noted, however, that farmers have a tendency to refrain from reporting the presence of regulated pests on their farm. 
 Resilient cropping systems From the point of view of cropping systems, ""preparing for the worst-case scenario"" translates into uncovering what currently makes cropping systems resilient to extreme, variable, and unpredictable situations. Promising avenues to achieve resilience include genetic diversification and combinations of crop protection systems. An example developed for late blight in potato crops relies on varietal resistance coupled with new methods to monitor loss of resistance (http://euroblight.net/ potato-ipm/best-practice). Likewise, the combination of native arthropod natural enemies with entomopathogens against invasive species as those reported for T. absoluta in tomato crops could be effective  (Molla et al. 2011 ). The literature review on this subject reveals a notable scarcity of knowledge and references. The lack of information is acute regarding what constitutes robust or resilient cropping systems and, more generally, how cropping systems can be managed to reduce the risks associated with invasive alien as well as rapidly evolving indigenous pest species under climate change. This reflects a serious knowledge gap within a priority research area and is one which needs urgent attention. Socio-economic researchers should work on these issues to ensure that the solutions proposed are appropriate for stakeholders. 
 Crop-weed competition Although weeds have a much greater potential to cause crop losses than many insect pests and pathogens, the study of climate change impact on crop-weed competition has been largely overlooked. In some cases, differential responses between weeds and crops could be a source of opportunity. For example, red or weedy rice shows a much stronger response to rising CO 2 than cultivated rice  (Ziska et al. 2012 ) and consequently could serve as a unique source of genes which may potentially contribute to the adaptation of cultivated rice to climatic uncertainties. In addition, it is important to adopt the concept of the damage niche in future studies to take into account the impact of management practices and weeds on crop yields in a changing climate. 
 Anticipation and international monitoring Strategies that identify the vulnerabilities of cropping systems prior to pest introduction and establishment are worthwhile preventative approaches. An example is the international collaboration between the UK and China  (Fitt et al. 2008)  to help the latter decrease the risk of invasion from Leptosphaeria maculans, the causal agent of Phoma canker of Brassica crops. The collaboration included support on pest risk analysis to determine the risk of entry and establishment of the pathogen, training on symptom recognition, PCR diagnostics, disease epidemiology, cultivar resistance screening techniques, surveys on the distribution of Phoma agents, and workshops with policy makers on risks and strategies to prevent the pathogen spread. International and/or global coordination in the immediateand long-range surveillance and monitoring has also been identified as an invaluable tool to monitor both invasive alien species and the appearance of new and more aggressive strains of existing pest species. The Borlaug Global Rust Initiative (http://www.globalrust.org/traction/permalink/about37@1), covering 20 countries in several continents, is an example of coordination on new highly virulent strains of rust that have the potential to induce widespread wheat crop failures. It operates as a worldwide warning system for potential rust outbreaks. Within the EU, Europhyt (http://ec.europa.eu/food/plant/plant_ health_biosafety/europhyt/index_en.htm) acts as an effective rapid alert system for Member States with regard risk management responses to interceptions and incursions of harmful organisms of importance to all associated countries within the Union. The creation of a truly global database, or integrated information exchange platform, on harmful organisms accessible by all countries could be another useful step, for example, integrating the expertise and intelligence gathering and surveillance of regional plant protection organizations toward an overarching view. 
 Breeding for and sustaining resistance A priority area should be breeding for resistance and devising strategies to sustain that resistance. It should follow an assessment of how existing farming systems and crop rotation practices and varieties will perform under changing climatic conditions. It requires breeding for varieties that are both adapted to changing climates and those containing temperature-stable resistance genes. Deployment strategies or the combination of new varieties with other methods will be needed to ensure that resistance to pest is sustained and durable. 
 Biological control Research and development in biological control is another priority area which will help to adapt cropping systems to the appearance of new pests and changing climatic conditions. In particular, biological control studies in arable crops are lacking which need to be addressed to reduce the reliance on pesticides on these species and consequent development of pest resistance to pesticides. Making use of opportunistic native natural enemies against new exotic pests can also be seen as a promising avenue. For example, promoting biocontrol services by using generalist natural enemies  (Lu et al. 2012) , i.e., natural enemies able to attack a wide range of prey including those potential exotic and invasive ones, may increase the robustness of cropping systems when compared to systems relying mainly on pesticides which shows generally very poor biocontrol services. Looking beyond Europe, in North Africa and West and Central Asia, for example, there is a need for biological control agents specifically adapted to warmer and drier conditions; pro-active studies maybe developed to identify key natural enemies as possible biocontrol agents for management of potential invasive pest species. 
 Pest risk analysis Even though there are recognized limits to pest risk analysis in terms of its power to predict establishment, it remains an important early warning tool. Pest risk analysis can help to identify those pest species which present the highest risk for European cropping systems. With pest risk analysis, it becomes possible to propose adaptations to cropping systems in advance or to conduct research on the ecological requirements and/or control options related to pest origins. Greater progress could be achieved with pest risk analysis if it could be made more spatially explicit or based on ""hotspots"" or case studies so that site-specific conditions affecting the likelihood of establishment are taken into account. Furthermore, enhanced international information exchange with regards to completely new and exotic disease threats and pressures, as highlighted in Section 5.7, are foreseen as a critical element of an effective, and often urgently required pest risk analysis, e.g., under an emergency incursion situation. 
 Conclusion Climate-driven changes present challenges and opportunities for sustainable agriculture programs based on IPM. As suggested by  Anderson et al. (2004) , research on the effect of climate change on pest evolution must shift from passive cataloging to analysis and interpretation of the factors favoring outbreaks. If Europe's agricultural production is to keep pace with a growing food demand while satisfying environmental goals, we will need new cultivars, major changes in IPM programs, increased funding, and improved response time to new and evolving pests that lead to outbreaks. Although climate change is expected to impact European agriculture, by influencing the stability of crop yield, information on the real consequences are lacking, and studies in this regard remain in their infancy. Our inability to make confident predictions highlights a need for new research on several fronts. Policies are needed to fill this uncertainty gap by considering a wide range of possible scenarios. Hence, research based on a broader collaborative approach should be made in order to develop anticipatory adaptive strategies resulting in more resilient cropping strategies and stabilized yields. Toward this ultimate aim, enhanced interregional, transnational, and global networking of researchers and stakeholders, at all levels across the plant health/crop protection spectrum, considering the scale and increasing pressures on crop production and yields, is an effective way to better use the limited resources in order to address this twenty-first century challenge in an ever increasing integrated global context.

 Fig. 2 2 Yellow rust (Puccinia striiformis) on winter wheat. New strains of this fungus have adapted to produce spores at warmer temperatures than usual expression, new virulence of pathogens, and presence of other host plants and, overarching all these, more favorable infection conditions due to climate change warrant a careful inventory of the new knowledge needed to prevent unprecedented disease outbreaks in the future.

DNA in rodents from Asia, West Africa and Europe",,"Orientia tsutsugamushi is the only known species belonging to the Orientia bacterial genus. The bacterium causes scrub typhus in humans. It is an obligate intracytosolic bacterium that is transmitted during feeding by larval trombiculid mites, and is hosted by rodents  [1] . In Asia, approximately one million cases of scrub typhus occur annually, where it is probably one of the most underdiagnosed and underreported febrile illnesses requiring hospitalization  [2] , with an estimated 10% fatality rate unless treated appropriately. Formerly thought to be geographically restricted to Asia  [3] , Orientia was recently identified in sick patients from the Arabian Peninsula  [4]  and Chile  [5] . Miscellaneous reports of scrub typhus-like illness have previously questioned the presence of the bacterium in the Congo  [6]  and Cameroon  [7] . 
 Methods In order to generate a global picture of zoonotic bacteria that are likely to be harboured by rodents, we applied a metagenomic approach using spleen samples of 1334 rodents from France (Ardennes region), Senegal (along the Senegal River) and Thailand (northern and northeastern provinces of Loei, Nan and Buriram). Rodents were trapped in both natural habitats and villages within rural landscapes. They were euthanized by cervical dislocation and dissected. In order to prevent cross contamination during dissection, we systematically alternated the use of two sets of dissecting instruments. After dissecting a rodent, the set used was immersed in bleach then water and let in alcohol, while we dissected another rodent with the other set  [8] . Spleens were placed in RNAlater® storage solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) then stored at -20°C until further analysis. Genomic DNA was then extracted from the spleen using the DNeasy® 96 Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany). Spleen DNA samples were screened for the presence of bacteria using universal primers targeting the hyper variable region V4 of the 16S rRNA gene (251 bp) via Illumina MiSeq (Illumina) sequencing. The V4 region has been proven to have excellent taxonomic resolution at the genus level  [9] . A multiplexing strategy enabled the identification of bacterial genera in each individual sample. We followed the method described in  [10]  to perform PCR amplification, indexing, pooling, multiplexing and de-multiplexing and finally taxonomic identification using the SILVA SSU Ref NR 119 database as a reference (http://www.arb-silva.de/projects/ssu-ref-nr/). In total we performed four different MiSeq runs, two with rodents from France (N = 557), one with rodents from Asia (N = 423) and one with rodents from Africa (N = 354). For each run, we systematically used negative controls (of DNA extraction and PCR) and none were positive for Orientia. Though we did not use positive controls for Orientia because the bacterium was not expected in European and African samples. We used positive controls for other bacterial genus like Leptospira, Borrelia, Bartonella and Mycoplasma, and all were found positive for the expected bacterial genera. 
 Results and discussion From over a total of 1334 rodents tested, 110 were found positive for Orientia  (Table 1) . As expected, Orientia was detected in five sampled rodent species from Thailand: Rattus tanezumi (5 positives/67 tested), Rattus exulans (1/81), Bandicota savilei (2/26), Berylmys bowersi (1/17), and Leopoldamys edwardsi (1/10). More surprisingly, the bacterium was also detected in numerous rodents collected from both France and Senegal. In Senegal, Orientia sequences were only identified in the exotic house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) (48 positives/207 tested), while the sympatric endemic multimammate rats (Mastomys erythroleucus) were all found to be negative (0/147), suggesting introduction of the bacterium via the exotic rodent. In France, Orientia sp. was detected in three rodent species: Myodes glareolus (44/302), Arvicola scherman (2/64) and Microtus arvalis (6/49). Positive for Orientia were trapped inside human houses in Asia and Africa, and in close proximity to human dwellings in Asia and France. In rodents, blood, spleen and other organs are routinely used for Orientia PCR detection  [11] , although one should notice that such assay is limited to the time window of rickettsemia, i.e. when the bacteria are infecting macrophages in peripheral blood. In our experiments we targeted the spleen because this organ is known to act primarily as a blood filter and then appears appropriate for detecting bacteria infecting blood cells. However, although there are many lines of evidence that Orientia may chronically infect humans and rodents, the persistence of the bacteria in organs, and spleen in particular, is currently poorly known  [12] . Thus we cannot discard the possibility of false negatives in our assays. Sequence analyses revealed that the Orientia sequences identified in this study were between 100 to 94.4% identical to GenBank-published Orientia sequences isolated from humans, mites and rodents in Asia. All sequences shared only 90.8 to 86.5% identity with GenBank-published Rickettsia, the closest bacterial genus to Orientia, thus consolidating our finding on the presence of Orientia in Europe and Africa. We also performed phylogenetic analyses of both the haplotypes identified in this study, and those from GenBank databases, using the neighbor-joining method  [13] . Bootstrap analysis was performed on 1,000 replicates. Haplotypes from this study clustered strongly within the Orientia phylogroup and were clearly separated from the Rickettsia phylogroup. Asian haplotypes were distributed amongst Genbank haplotypes from Asia and Arabian peninsula (Chuto haplotype), African haplotypes fell with the Chuto haplotype, whereas European haplotypes clustered into a new basal phylogroup  (Figure 1 ). 
 Conclusion We have established the presence of Orientia DNA in spleens of rodents from Thailand, as was expected, but also in rodents collected from France and Senegal. In Asia, scrub typhus is considered as a seriously neglected life-threatening disease despite the fact that this ancient disease has been recognized within this region for many   years. Our findings, together with those from other recent studies  [4, 5]  suggest that in locales outside of Asia where the disease is not on the public health service radar, surveillance needs to be improved.

The fact that wood is a biological material, structurally complex, heterogeneous, and anistropic, represents a significant challenge in predicting the influence of the grain, as well as the change in its properties in relation to the cutting axis/direction. The unpredictable variability of wood properties makes it difficult to 2 Diverse studies have dealt with wood behavior during processing, especially in seeking explanations regarding the forces involved in the cutting process based on wood characteristics  (Kivimaa, 1950; McKenzie, 1962; Koch, 1964; Fischer R, 1999; Aguilera & Martin, 2001; Eyma et al., 2001 Eyma et al., , 2004a Eyma et al., , 2004b Eyma et al., , 2005 Porankiewicz et al., 2011) . However, most of these studies have focused on the density or moisture of the wood and few of them focus on the mechanical properties of the xylem tissue, describing its influence in the process. Satisfactory correlations among these wood properties and the cutting forces have been shown; but there are still gaps since such properties have not yet been able to completely explain the phenomenon or because the studies did not consider the particular nature of the anatomical structure of the species. In a comparative study of wood cutting force, it is appropriate to use specific cutting force, which represents the amount of force necessary to remove a volume unit of material. It is directly connected with the forces that act on the cutting tool during processing  (Koch, 1972) . Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of xylem tissue cell structure, determined through biometry and basic density of the wood from Corymbia citriodora Hill & Johnson on consumption of specific 90º-0º longitudinal cutting force. 
 Materials and methods Three individuals of Corymbia citriodora Hill & Johnson of 7 years of age, with 18.34 cm of average diameter at 1.3 m above ground were selected from an experimental plantation in the region of the Vale do Rio Doce/MG in Brazil (19°28′8″ S; 42°32′12″ W; 231 m altitude) from the Cenibra S.A. company. A diametrical board, with dimensions of 60 x 18 x 5 cm (length x width x thickness, respectively) was removed from each tree  (Figure 1) . To obtain the consumption of specific longitudinal cutting force (90º-0º) in the pith to bark direction, the material was machined with a 7.5 HP table saw with sliding table, with a system for controlling feed and cutting speed. A circular saw was used with 400 mm diameter, 24 alternating teeth, WZ profile, 5 mm thickness, and without blade tooth wear  (Figure 2) . A table was adapted which allowed millimetric lateral feeds of the test specimens so that the cuts could be made at specific points of the xylem tissue in the pith to bark direction, which was established equal to the thickness of the circular saw teeth, for reduction of the effects of internal strains of the wood. This table also had pneumatic pistons for fastening the material, making for safe operation  (Figure 3) . According with the pneumatic pistons dimension was analyzed only a ray (pith-bark direction) of each board. The wood analyzed presented centralized pith; however the small diameter of the boards only allowed six cuts, performed every 1.5 cm away from the pith and always at regions free of defects (  Figure 1 ). Collection and storage of the electrical parameters of processing the material was performed by a WEG frequency inverter, model CFW 08, equipped with serial communication interface (KSD CFW08) and Super Drive software (programming software of WEG drives), connected to a microcomputer (  Figure 2 ). During the cuts, the feed rate used was 10 m.min -1 , the cutting speed was 61 m.s -1 , corresponding to mean rotation of 2920 rpm, and maximum instantaneous torque was 92.5 N.m, with cutting duration of 5 s. Thus, the specific cutting force (J.cm -3 ) was determined by the instantaneous measurements of torque (N.m) and by the rotation of the motor shaft (rpm). The frequency of data acquisition (rotation and torque) was 4 Hz. Communication between the frequency inverter and the microcomputer was performed by the serial interface module RS-232 PC/Drive. For parameterization and monitoring of the data of the frequency inverter, the Super Drive software was used. For that purpose, the value proportional to the frequency (rpm), the output current of the motor (amperes), the output voltage of the motor (volts), and the motor torque (%) were acquired simultaneously. For calculation of specific cutting force (J.cm -3 ), the instantaneous power curves were determined (Equation 1). P instantaneous = T i × n i (1) in which: P i = instantaneous power (W); After that, integration of the instantaneous power curves was carried out as a function of time to calculate the total cutting force (J), in accordance with Equation 2. E Total = P instantaneous 0 t ∫ × dt (2) in which: E Total = Total cutting force (J); dt = time in seconds Finally, consumption of specific cutting force (J.cm -3 ) was determined from Equation 3. Es = E total c × e × k (3) in which: E s = specific cutting force (J.cm -3 ); c = length of test specimen (cm); e = thickness of test specimen (cm); K = thickness of the tool tooth (cm); During the machining tests samples were removed at 1.5 cm of thickness located in an alternate and parallel manner to the cuts of the machining trials. The samples were subdivided into smaller specimens, duly oriented (radial, tangential and axial) with 1.5 cm edges, to determinate the average value of anatomical parameters and basic density in each of the six radial positions that the cuts were made  (Figure 4 ).     Physical characterization was made for basic density (Db = Mo/Vsat, i.e. ""anhydrous mass/saturated volume""), in accordance with NBR 7190 (ABNT, 1997). The moisture content average of the assessed boards was 16%. 
 4 Quantitative anatomy of the xylem tissue was carried out according to the International Association of Wood Anatomists  (IAWA, 1989) . For preparation of the macerated material, the method of  Franklin (1945)  was used and 30 measurements at each obtained specimen were made for the biometry of the elements of vessels (number per mm 2 and diameter), of rays (height and width), and of fibers (length, total width, lumen diameter). After that, fiber wall thickness and fiber wall fraction were calculated (Equations 4 and 5, respectively). 
 Wall thickness = Fiber width − Lumen diameter 2 (4) Wall fraction = 2 × Wall thickness Fiber width × 100 (5) To estimate the fiber wall portion available per mm², Equation 6 was developed, based on the values of mean vessel frequency and diameter and fiber wall fraction, disregarding the portion of parenchymal cells in the xylem tissue. FWP = 1− Fv × π Dv 2 4 ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ × FWF (6) In which: FWP = Fiber wall portion, in %; Fv = number of vessels per mm²; Dv = mean diameter of vessel elements, in mm; FWF = fiber wall fraction, in %. A test for homogeneity of variances was conducted (Bartlett's test, at 5% probability) preliminary to analysis of variance. For all the parameters evaluated, deviations from these analysis' assumptions were not observed. The data were subjected to Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and F-test at p<0.05 to verify differences between the radial positions. The experimental design was established with six points, the anatomical parameters and the basic density were considered as independent factors and the specific power cut as the dependent variable. From the mean values obtained in the six radial positions sampled in the three boards, Pearson correlation analysis was performed between the evaluated properties and applied linear regression analysis to assess the functional relationships between the biometrics of the cells and the basic density with specific strength of longitudinal section (90º-0º). All statistical analysis was performed using the R software, version 3.0.1 (R Development Core Team, 2013) through the packages ExpDes  (Ferreira et al., 2013)  and Stats (R Development Core Team, 2013). 
 Results The radial variation and descriptive statistics of the measured properties are listed in  Table 1 .  Table 2  shows the summary of the analysis of variance for wood properties and specific cutting force at pith to the bark direction. It is observed that except for the height and width of the rays and also the width of the fiber, all other anatomical parameters measured, as the basic density and specific cutting force presented significant statistical difference to the source of variation in radial position pith to bark. In general there was an increase in the radial direction of the pith to the bark for the specific cutting force, basic density, vessel diameter, fiber length, fiber wall thickness, fiber wall fraction and fiber wall portion. Opposite behaviour was observed for the frequency of vessels and diameter of the fibers lumen, in which there was a reduction of the average values of the pith toward the bark. It can be observed from the descriptive statistics presented in  Table 1 , mainly from the low values obtained for the overall coefficient of variation of the data, the average of the properties among the individuals was very close. The radial variation profile of the properties did not differ between the evaluated individuals. The correlation between the properties is shown in  Table 3 . The main results show that some anatomical parameters are correlated with each other and with density, significant correlations were observed between biometrics of the cells and specific gravity with specific cutting force. The anatomical parameter with the highest number of significant correlations was the frequency of vessels per mm², because with the exception of the height and width of the rays, all other anatomical parameters evaluated and also the basic density were strongly correlated with this anatomical parameter. Mostly negative correlations were observed; only the lumen diameter of the fibers was positively associated with the frequency of vessels. In general also the anatomical parameters related to the size of the fibers showed strong correlations with each other, the width and the lumen diameter of the fibers were the only negatively correlated with the basic density. For the correlations of biometrics cells and basic density with the specific cutting force was observed that the specific cutting force was positively correlated with the basic density of the wood (r = 0.94). A better fit was also observed for the simple linear model for basic density (R 2 = 0.89) (  Figure 5 ). An increase was seen in consumption of specific cutting force in accordance with an increase in wood density.

It was observed that the anatomical parameters showed significant correlation with the specific cutting force in the pith to bark direction, with the exception of height (r = 0.17) and ray width (r = 0.3) and fiber width (r = -0.42), which did not show significant correlation. 
 Radial position sampled 
 SV DF 
 Mean For the vessel elements, it was observed that the frequency per mm 2 showed the best correlation, a negative correlation with specific cutting force (r = -0.88). In contrast, a positive correlation (r = 0.66) was observed for diameter. The vessel frequency per mm² was responsible for approximately 77% of radial variation  (Figure 6a) . As for the correlations obtained between specific cutting force and vessel diameter  (Figure 6b    Table 3 . Correlation between wood properties, in which Scf = specific cutting force; Bd = basic density; Vf = vessel frequency; Vd = vessel diameter; Rh = ray height; Rw = ray width; Fl = fiber length; Fwi = fiber width; Fd = fiber lumen diameter; Fw = fiber wall thickness; FWF = fiber wall fraction, and FWP = fiber wall portion.  moderate positive relation was observed (R² = 0.43). It was observed that the behavior of increasing vessel diameter in the pith to bark direction occurred along with reduction in vessel frequency and increase in fiber wall thickness and basic density of the wood, this result is confirmed from the strong negative correlation between the frequency of vessels with the vessel diameter, wall thickness and basic density, r = -0.95, -0.81 and -0.81 respectively  (Table 2  and  Figures 7 and 8) . 
 Vf It was observed that fiber lumen diameter was negatively correlated with the specific cutting force (r = -0.95), with the increase in this anatomical parameter, there was a decreasing tendency of specific cutting force, responsible for 90% of the radial variation of this magnitude  (Figure 9 ). The length (r = 0.94), the wall thickness (r = 0.90), the wall fraction (r = 0.95), and the fiber wall portion (r = 0.96) were positively correlated with specific cutting force, according to  Figure 10a , b, c, d, respectively. The fiber wall portion alone was capable of explaining around 93% of the radial variation of the specific cutting force, analyzing the angular coefficients of the regression obtained it was also observed that every 1% of the fiber wall portion increase (pith-bark direction) there is an increase of approximately 0.45 J.cm -3 of the specific cutting force  (Figure 10d ). This anatomical parameter allowed closer determination of the true behavior of the wood during machining. In comparison to the results obtained from basic density, there was a 4% improvement in explanation of the percentage of variation of specific cutting force. 7 Effect of wood anatomy and wood density on cutting force 
 Discussion The increase in basic density in the pith to the bark direction promoted consumption of specific cutting force in the external position of the boards closest to the bark. The basic density was able to explain the radial consumption of specific cutting force of the wood, and is responsible for 89% of its variation. This may be due to the presence of weak and lighter wood at the first radial centimetres near the pith and more dense and resistant wood near the bark which demanded most motor torque to cut the wood which has led to  fibers responsible for mechanical support of the main stem, and which consequently leads to production of denser wood  (Chave et al., 2009) . It was observed that the behavior of increasing vessel diameter in the pith to bark direction occurred along with reduction in vessel frequency and increase in fiber wall thickness. Thus, it is probable that the effect expected for the increase in vessel diameter in terms of consumption of specific cutting force was annulled by the reduction in vessel frequency and increase in fiber wall thickness in the radial direction in which the cut was made. With the exception of lumen diameter of the fibers were found high positive correlation between the dimensions of the fibers and the consumption of specific cutting force. This behavior is due to the fact that fibers of greater dimensions normally are characteristics of woods that have high mechanical resistance, and, as such, more resistant to cutting and the lumen represents the space that is not occupied by the fiber cell wall. The thickness of the fiber cell wall and the fraction of its volume may have a positive influence on wood density, which is commonly associated with mechanical strength of woody species  (Salmén & Burget, 2009; Uetimane & Ali, 2011) . According to  Poorter et al. (2010) , in most leafy species, fibers make up the big-increased the consumption of specific strength cut. Similar results were obtained by many authors  (Kivimaa 1950; Koch 1964 Koch , 1972 Eyma et al., 2001 Eyma et al., , 2004a Eyma et al., , 2004b Eyma et al., , 2005 , which agreed that during processing, denser woods, or even denser regions of the same sample tend to introduce heavier chips that require more strength to their removal, and consequently more energy to move the cutting tool. The fact that the basic density showed high degree of correlation with the specific cutting force, as it is observed in results, can be an evidence of this. For correlations established between the cells biometrics and the specific cutting force the initial hypothesis was that greater values of vessel frequency per mm 2 and vessel diameter would result in a negative effect on consumption of specific cutting force because the greater presence of empty spaces leads to wood with lower density and mechanical resistance  (Zobel & Van Buijtenen, 1989) , requiring less force for cutting. However, this prediction was confirmed only for vessel frequency per mm² in this study. From the physiological point of view, the increase in vessel diameter is related to the plant investing in water efficiency because vessel elements of greater diameter are more effective in conveying water per unit area. In contrast, with the prominent reduction in vessel frequency, xylem tissue is more highly occupied by thick wall gest part of the xylem tissue (from 26 to 74% of the area of the cross section). The influence of this anatomical parameter on the wood machining process is thus understandable, notably related to the forces involved in the cutting process. Thus correlations obtained shows that consumption of specific cutting force is dependent on the percentage of cell wall effectively available for cutting and that, in general, when there is an increase in this percentage, there is also an increase in the consumption of this specific cutting force. 
 Conclusions The increase in basic density in the pith to the bark direction had a positive effect on the cutting force, the highest values of density found near the bark led to higher consumption of specifies power cut at this region. The frequency of vessels per mm² showed a strong negative correlation with the specific cutting force, accounting for 77% of the radial variation. The variations in the parameters related to the dimensions of the fibers, especially in regard to wall proportions, allowed substantial improvement in understanding specific power consumption during machining of the wood under analysis. The wall portion of the fibers explains 93% of the radial variation of the specific cutting force, a 4% increase compared to the basic density. Figure 1 . 1 Mechanical processing of the material.

The root, which is the major edible portion of the plant, is an important source of dietary energy and comprises more than 80% starch  (Montagnac et al. 2009; Lyer et al. 2010; Harris and Koomson 2011) . Historically, cassava has played an important role in food security as a famine reserve crop. In Eastern and Southern Africa where maize is preferred, but drought is recurrent, cassava, which is, to some extent drought tolerant, is harvested when other crops fail  (Rosenthal and Ort 2012) . Similarly, cassava provides additional food security when armed conflicts lead to the destruction of above-ground crops, as it remains viable below ground for up to 36 months  (Rosenthal and Ort 2012) . While cassava continues to be a vital subsistence crop for small-scale farmers, it is also an increasingly important crop on both regional and global levels  (Rosenthal and Ort 2012) . In addition to its role in food security, cassava is being used as a biofuel crop in many countries, including China, Thailand, and Brazil  (Dai et al. 2006; Nguyen et al. 2007; Zidenga 2012; Zidenga et al. 2012) . Globally, cassava is the fifth most important crop overall in terms of human caloric intake ). However, subsistence and commercial utilization of cassava are affected by its short shelf life that results from a rapid postharvest physiological deterioration (PPD) process, which renders the root unpalatable within 72 h of harvest  (Owiti et al. 2011) . Posthaverst physiological deterioration is triggered by mechanical damage, an inevitable result of harvesting operations. PPD then progresses from the site of damage, eventually causing general discoloration of the vascular parenchyma throughout the root. According to previous studies  Uarrota et al. 2014) , cassava root deterioration is related to two separate processes: physiological, or primary, deterioration and microbiological, or secondary, deterioration  (Acedo and Acedo 2013; Njoku et al. 2014 ). Physiological deterioration is usually the initial cause of reduced acceptability of roots. It can be observed by the blue-black streaks in the root vascular tissue that later spread and cause a more general brown discoloration finally leading to unsatisfactory cooking quality and adverse taste  (Salcedo et al. 2010; Sayre et al. 2011; Naziri et al. 2014) . Primary deterioration also involves changes in oxidative enzyme activities which generate phenols, including catechins and leucoanthocyanidins, which polymerize in later stages to form condensed tannins  (Zidenga 2012; García et al. 2013; Sánchez et al. 2013) . Microbiological deterioration results from pathogenic rot, fermentation, and/or softening of the roots, and generally occurs when the roots have already become unacceptable because of physiological deterioration. Few reliable estimates can be found that document the extent of postharvest losses. A systematic assessment of physical losses worldwide by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) suggests that losses of root and tuber crops are in the range of 30% to 60%. In the case of cassava in Africa, losses in 2002 were estimated at 19 million tons out of a total production of 101 million tons across the entire continent  (NRI 2014; Harris et al. 2015 ). Yet, the magnitude of losses significantly differs across countries and different value chains within a single country as such losses largely depend on how cassava is produced, processed, and consumed, and on the level of coordination among value chain actors  (Naziri et al. 2014) . Extending the shelf life of cassava by about 2 to 3 weeks would translate into a reduction in financial losses by about $2.9 billion in Nigeria alone over a 20-year period  (Zidenga 2012) . The rapid postharvest perishability of freshly harvested cassava roots is a problem not known in any other root and tuber crop. Within 1-3 days of harvest, roots begin to develop an endogenous disorder, typically characterized by blue-black streaking of the vascular tissues of the xylem, which is accompanied by an unpleasant odor and flavor. PPD profoundly impacts processing as well as marketing of the roots  (Lyer et al. 2010) . Several approaches have been developed to preserve cassava roots, such as underground storage, storage in boxes with moist sawdust, storage in bags combined with the use of fungicides, pruning plants before harvest, cold storage (2-4°C) for up to 2 weeks, freezing or waxing the roots to prevent access to oxygen, and even chemical treatments  (Howeler et al. 2013; Sánchez et al. 2013) . However, these methods are too expensive or complicated for handling large volumes of roots and have been restricted mostly to high-value product chains, such as the consumption of fresh cassava roots ). Thus, a major goal of cassava breeding and biotechnology is to increase its shelf life by delaying the onset of PPD. Such efforts would expand the industrial applications of cassava worldwide  (Zidenga 2012) . Molecular and biochemical studies of PPD have pointed to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production as one of the earliest events in the process, and many other compounds have been reported  (Buschmann et al. 2000; Reilly et al. 2003) . Specific genes involved in PPD have been identified and characterized, and their expression has been evaluated  (Reilly et al. 2007; Timothy 2009 ). Several secondary metabolites, particularly hydroxycoumarins, accumulate in the process  (Bayoumi et al. 2008; Bayoumi et al. 2010 ). However, more research is necessary to better understand the biochemical changes involved in PPD of cassava roots. Accordingly, this study aimed to evaluate the biochemical changes involved in PPD in four cassava cultivars, including fresh roots (hereinafter designated as nonstored samples) and root samples stored up to 11 days. Using metabolomic techniques integrated with chemometric tools, we further assessed biochemical markers of PPD. Supervised and unsupervised methods of data analysis were also used to discriminate among cassava samples during postharvest physiological deterioration. 
 Material and Methods 
 Selection of cassava cultivars Cassava cultivars were provided by the Santa Catarina State Agricultural Research and Rural Extension Agency (EPAGRI), specifically, the experimental station of Urussanga, and were produced over the 2011/2012 growing season. Four cultivars were selected for this study as follows: SCS 253 Sangão (hereinafter designated as SAN), Branco (hereinafter designated as BRA, a landrace), IAC576-70 (hereinafter designated as IAC, a commercial variety), and Oriental (hereinafter designated as ORI, a landrace). The cultivars were selected as they are widely used by small farmers and lacking research efforts. 
 Plant materials and postharvest physiological deterioration On-farm trials were carried out at the Ressacada Experimental Farm (Plant Science Center, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florianópolis, SC, Brazil -27°35′48″ S, 48°32′57″W) in September 2011, using the four EPAGRI cassava cultivars noted above. The experimental design was in complete randomized blocks, with 4 blocks (6.3 × 15 m 2 /block) spaced at 1 m. Each block consisted of four plots (12 × 1.2 m 2 /plot), spaced at 0.5 m. Cassava stakes of length 15 cm were planted upright and spaced 1 × 1 m. Each plot was considered an experimental unit to which a treatment was applied, and all land operations were mechanized. Soil fertility had already been determined by chemical analysis, and cultivation was performed manually. Cassava root samples were harvested from 12-month-old plants for analysis. Immediately after harvest, the roots were washed with sterilized water, and both proximal and distal parts of the root were removed. Cross sections were made (0.5-1 cm) over the remaining root and stored at room temperature (66-76% humidity, ±25°C). Induction of PPD was performed during 11 days using different roots in the same batch. Monitoring the development of PPD and associated metabolic disturbances was performed daily after induction of PPD. Fresh samples and those at 3, 5, 8, and 11 days postharvest were collected at each point, dried (35-40°C/48 h) in an oven, milled with a coffee grinder (Model DGC-20N series, Cadence, Brazil), and kept for analysis. For enzymatic analysis, nonstored samples were collected and stored (-80°C) until analysis. PPD was also induced using two other methodologies, including storage of the entire root and the method of  Wheatley (1982)  whereby only the proximal and distal parts of the roots were removed without slicing the remaining part. The experiment was conducted using the same room conditions as to the method described firstly. 
 Postharvest Physiological Deterioration Scoring Five independent evaluations of PPD were carried out. For each harvest, a random sample of three sliced roots from each plant variety was scored according to visual observations of sliced cassava roots (from 1 -10% of deterioration to 10-100% of deterioration) at each stage of PPD (i.e., 3, 5, 8, and 11 days postharvest) and imaged with a digital camera (OLYMPUS FE-4020, 14 megapixel, China). The mean PPD score for each root was calculated by averaging the scores for the three transversal sections and five evaluations (see  Table S1 ). Roots showing symptoms of microbial rotting, which would not be reflective of PPD, or those showing inset activity were discarded. 
 Dry matter content (%) To obtain the dry matter content of cassava samples, 10-30 g of chopped and grated fresh roots were weighed, and oven dried at 60°C for 48 h. Dry matter was expressed as the percentage of dry weight relative to fresh weight  (Morante et al. 2010) . 
 Polyphenol oxidase activity during PPD For polyphenol oxidase (PPO) analysis, 2 g of fresh tissue were homogenized with 0.6 g of PVPP and 8 mL of 50 mmol/L (pH 7) phosphate buffer, followed by recovery of the supernatant by filtration and centrifugation (3220g, 4°C, 15 min, 18 cm of rotor radius). The product constituted an enzymatic extract. PPO activity was measured using 2.85 mL of 0.2 mmol/L (pH 7) phosphate buffer, 50 μL of catechol (60 mmol/L) as substrate, and 100 μL of enzymatic extract at 25°C. Changes in absorbance (420 nm) were recorded over a 5-min period in a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Spectrumlab D180, BEL Photonics, Brazil;  Montgomery and Sgarbieri 1975) . Activity was expressed as units of activity (UA), and one unit of PPO was defined as the change in one unit of absorbance per second. 
 Ascorbic acid determination during PPD Ascorbic acid (AsA) content was assayed as described previously with slight modifications  (Omaye et al. 1979) . The extract was prepared by grinding 1 g of sample with 5 mL of 10% TCA, centrifuged (2465g, 18 cm rotor radius, 20 min), and then re-extracted twice. To the supernatant, 1.0 mL of extract and 1 mL of DTC reagent (2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazinethiourea-CuSO 4 ) were added to a total volume of 10 mL and incubated (37°C, 3 h), followed by the addition of 0.75 mL ice-cold 65% H 2 SO 4 (v v −1 ). The mixture was allowed to stand for 30 min at 30°C. The resulting color was read at 520 nm in the spectrophotometer (Spectrumlab D180, BEL Photonics, Brazil). A standard AsA curve was constructed to determine content (y = 0.0361x, r 2 = 0.99, 0 to 1000 mg mL −1 ) and the results were expressed in μg g −1 (ppm) of fresh weight. 
 Protein extraction and quantification from cassava roots during PPD At each sampling time, root tissues were grated using a food processor (Walita-Master Plus, Brazil) and stored at −80°C before use. The frozen tissue was ground under liquid nitrogen to a fine powder using a prechilled pestle and mortar. Then, 5 g of tissue were added to a prechilled 50 mL tube containing 20 mL of extraction buffer (phosphate buffer 0.1 mol/L, pH 6.4, 0.25 g of PVP), 200 μL of 1 mmol/L DTT, and 200 μL of 1 mmol/L EDTA. Tubes were vortexed vigorously and transferred to a horizontal shaker (300 rpm) for 1 h. Tubes were centrifuged (5000 rpm, 20 min), and the supernatant was recovered by filtration, transferred to a fresh tube, and stored at −20°C  (Reilly 2001) . The protein content of each sample was determined using the Bradford protocol  (Bradford 1976 ) with small modifications. A calibration curve was constructed using bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as standard. Protein solutions were prepared in 0.15 M NaCl, and a series of dilutions was prepared (0 to 100 mg mL −1 , y = 0.0082x, r 2 = 0.96) to build the standard curve. 
 Extraction and quantification of soluble sugars and organic acids by HPLC during PPD Nonstored samples and those at 3, 5, 8, and 11 days postharvest were collected. The outer and inner bark were removed and crushed with a food processor, as previously described, and dried in an oven at 35°C (48 h). After oven drying, samples were again crushed with a coffee grinder to obtain a fine powder, sieved and stored at room temperature for analysis. Sugars and organic acids were extracted from 0.5 g of cassava root flour samples in 10 mL of mobile phase (H 2 SO 4 , 5 mmol/L) and determined accordingly  (Chinnici et al. 2005) . Briefly, the suspension was homogenized using an Ika Works Ultra-Turrax (Ika, China) Digital Homogenizer and mixed slowly using a horizontal shaker (Microplate shaker, 330 rpm) for 30 min. The suspension was centrifuged (12879g, 10 min) and filtered through a 0.22 μm disposable syringe membrane filter, followed by collection of the supernatant. Sugars and organic acids were analyzed by HPLC using a Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-87H HPLC column equipped with a UV detector (MWDG 1365D for organic acids), connected in series with a refractive index detector (RID G 1362A for sugars) and an injection valve fitted with a 15 μL loop. The samples were separated isocratically at 0.6 mL min −1 at 30°C. Retention times and standard curves were prepared for the following sugars and organic acids (see  Table 1 ). Three consecutive injections (10 μL) were performed. Sugars and organic acids were expressed (mg g −1 ) as mean ± standard deviation. 
 Scopoletin extraction and quantification during PPD Cassava root flour samples (1 g) were placed in 50 mL falcon tubes containing 2 mL 98% ethanol and homogenized with an Ika Works Ultra-Turrax T18 ( IKA, China) for 30 sec. The suspension was vortexed (1 min), incubated (microplate shaker, 600 rpm, 30 min), and centrifuged (9861, 5 min). The extract was filtered on a Whatman # 1 paper and through a 0.22 μm nylon membrane. Samples were transferred to 1.5 mL vials for HPLC (Agilent 1200 series, Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) analysis  (Buschmann et al. 2000) . To accomplish this, samples (50 μL) were injected into the Agilent 1200 series HPLC equipped with a reverse-phase column (Techsphere BDS C18, 250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) and a diode array detector. The column was kept at 25°C, and acetonitrile and 0.5% phosphoric acid (v v −1 ) in aqueous solution were used as mobile phase. The gradient profile was 60 -1% for 30 min with a 0.5 mL min −1 flow and 50 μL injection volume. Scopoletin was detected at 215, 280, and 350 nm according to its retention time with a standard compound sample (Sigma-Aldrich: scopoletin ≥ 99% -No. S2500). Scopoletin quantification was determined through a calibration standard curve (y = 158159.59x, r 2 = 0.9993, 1-75 mg l −1 ). Three consecutive injections (10 μL) were performed. Quantifications were made on a dry weight basis, and data were represented in nmol g −1 , as mean ± standard deviation. 
 Statistical analysis Each harvest was considered independent from the others. Roots of the same cultivar in the four field blocks were combined into one bulk volume, and repetitions (n = 3) were made according to the bulk sample. All statistical analyses were carried out using R software (R core team-2015, version 3.1.1), using their respective packages and scripts. All values were presented as mean ± standard deviation of three repetitions (n = 3). Two-way ANOVA and multivariate analysis were applied when necessary. 
 Results and Discussion 
 PPD scoring Results of PPD scoring of the four genotypes studied showed that ORI was the most susceptible cultivar to PPD, followed by SAN, while BRA and IAC were found to be more tolerant  (Table 2 ). BRA and IAC showed a slower deterioration rate when compared with the faster deterioration rates observed at ORI and SAN. Similar regression coefficients were found among tolerant clones (0.935, 0.863 for ORI and SAN, respectively).  Figure 1  shows regression models for the four cultivars during storage. For all PPD methods, an increasing rate of deterioration throughout storage was observed. A clear relationship was found when using the average value of the three methods as shown in  Figure 1 . Cassava roots deteriorated faster after they were sliced. The root slicing method was applied to all analyses in this study. The entire root method was found to preserve the best postharvest quality, and BRA was the most resilient based on all testing methods. 
 Polyphenol oxidase Polyphenol oxidase results during storage are summarized in  Figure 2 . By comparing the mean PPO values from each cultivar, we found that BRA and ORI did not differ significantly (P < 0.05). During storage, a small decrease in PPO activity at day 8 was observed for IAC and SAN; however, in general, PPO activity varied similarly in the tolerant (BRA/IAC) and susceptible (SAN/ORI) cultivars. PPO activity based on analysis of nonstored samples and those at day 3 of PPD, showed significant difference from samples at days 5, 8, and 11 (P < 0.05). SAN showed higher PPO activity than other cultivars, particularly at days 3 and 5, most likely related to the higher PPD scores for this cultivar. When PPO values were correlated with PPD (see  Fig. S1A ), we found a high negative correlation and a clear discrimination between tolerant cultivar (BRA/IAC) and susceptible (ORI/SAN) ones. A similar trend in correlation values could be observed (0.790, 0.785, and 0.970, 0.93, respectively), meaning that higher activity of PPO in cassava roots was correlated with the reduced deterioration in that cultivars. Fluctuations in PPO, as shown in  Figure 2 , could be attributed to differences in genotype, as well as pre-and postharvest handling conditions. PPO has been identified as a major cause of darkening in raw Asian noodles and other wheat products  (Anderson et al. 2006) , as well as browning induced in mechanically damaged potatoes  (Batistuti and Lourenço 1985) . PPO catalyzes the oxidation of phenols into quinones, which subsequently polymerize into brown pigments, a phenomenon that has also been reported in avocado  (Gomez-Lopez 2002)  and browning in marula fruits  (Mdluli 2005) . 
 Ascorbic acid Our results showed that AsA gradually accumulated over time in all cultivars studied  (Fig. 3) . Interestingly, the cultivars with tolerance to PPD, IAC, and BRA, demonstrated the most extreme contrast for AsA, while the two susceptible cultivars, SAN and ORI, after several days of evaluation, showed only intermediate values of AsA. ORI showed a sharp increase in AsA after the third day of storage. SAN, on the other hand, showed a strong fluctuation in AsA activity through time, and, as a result, its behavior is difficult to define. Two-way ANOVA showed differences in AsA between BRA/SAN and ORI/IAC. During storage, nonstored samples were statistically different from samples at days 3, 5, 8, and 11, respectively (P < 0.05). Although  Figure 3  shows increases in AsA during storage until day 3, followed by fluctuation on other days, a clear correlation was found when assessing the levels of AsA between tolerant and susceptible cultivars in the context of PPD. Specifically, tolerant cultivars (BRA/IAC) behaved similarly and presented low negative correlations (0.785 and 0.793, respectively) when compared with susceptible cultivars (ORI/ SAN) (0.969 and 0.932, respectively) (see  Fig. S1B ). In susceptible cultivars, the levels of AsA appeared to impact the degree of deterioration. Thus, the high levels of AsA presented by the tolerant cultivar (BRA) may be interpreted as causing a delay in PPD. A wide range of factors, such as genotype, as well as pre-and postharvest conditions, may influence the AsA content. Losses of AsA during storage have been reported previously in many fruits, depending on storage conditions  (Kabasakalis et al. 2000) . Moreover, AsA has been reported to act as an antioxidant, thus prolonging the shelf life of commercial products  (Fung and Luk 1985) . In addition, lower storage temperatures have been reported to reduce the loss of AsA and the incidence of storage disorders in peas, broccoli, and spinach  (Felicetti and Mattheis 2010) . Although many studies have reported on the effects of AsA in many different crops, results of this study indicate that high levels of AsA may have a positive effect on PPD in cassava roots, thus inviting more research to better understand the precise role of AsA. 
 Changes in total proteins and dry matter content The results of total protein contents in the roots of the sampled cultivars are summarized in  Figure 4 . Protein amounts significantly changed among the cultivars over the experimental period, except for days 5 and 11 of storage, revealing a genotype-specific behavior for that variable. Interestingly, while a considerable increase in protein amount was observed on day 3 in BRA, which could possibly be attributed to its tolerance to PPD, IAC showed contrasting behavior. This variable also differed between BRA and ORI, and correlations between PPD and protein levels are all summarized in  Figure S1C . Lower negative correlations and similar trends in deterioration can be observed in all cultivars with protein levels, but such results make it difficult to define trends. Dry matter content was also determined in nonstored samples and was correlated with PPD at days 3, 5, 8, and 11. A positive correlation was established between dry matter and PPD, leading to the implication that cultivars with a high level of dry matter are more prone to suffer from PPD (see  Fig. S1D ). It was also observed that these correlations decreased as PPD progressed; thus, at days 3, 5, 8, and 11, we found correlation values of 37%, 25%, 17%, and 11%, respectively, and these findings confirm previous studies  (Ceballos et al. 2012; Sánchez et al. 2013) . Taken together, it can be concluded that cassava roots with lower content of dry matter have longer shelf life. 
 Scopoletin content during PPD The HPLC results of scopoletin contents during PPD are summarized in  Table 3  and a representative chromatographic profile for the studied cultivars during PPD is provided in  Figure S2 . It was found that tolerant cultivars presented high levels of scopoletin at the starting point (nonstored samples) and at day 11 of PPD. A different trend was observed for susceptible cultivars, which presented low levels of scopoletin in nonstored samples and at day 11 of PPD. Fluctuations during PPD can be attributed to such factors as genotype and PPD conditions. By correlating scopoletin with PPD (  Figure S3 ), we found that those cultivars with low levels of scopoletin presented a high degree of deterioration (ORI/SAN) when compared with tolerant ones (BRA/IAC). Unlike other variables, the positive correlation between scopoletin and PPD led to a clear separation of tolerant and susceptible cultivars. Two-way ANOVA showed significant differences (P < 0.05) in scopoletin levels in all cultivars and during storage. BRA showed a high level of scopoletin when compared to ORI. PPD has been described as a physiological process that results from altered gene expression  (Reilly et al. 2003; Reilly et al. 2004 ) and the accumulation of secondary metabolites. Among these secondary metabolites are found hydroxycoumarins (e.g., scopoletin) which show antioxidant properties, and by oxidation and polymerization, they confer the typical blue/black phenotype to root cassavas undergoing PPD. Hydroxycoumarins are important in plant defense as phytoalexins by the induction of biosynthesis following various stress events, such as wounding or bacterial and fungal infections. Additionally, they display a wide range of pharmacological activities, including anticoagulation  (Mueller 2004) , anti-inflammatory  (Silvan et al. 1996) , antimicrobial  (Smyth et al. 2009 ), and antitumoral  (Grazul and Budzisza 2009) . However, while their biosynthesis pathway in cassava has not been elucidated  (Wheatley 1982; Bayoumi et al. 2010) , their accumulation in the biomass of that species during root deterioration has been previously reported  (Wheatley 1982; Wheatley and Schwabe 1985; Sánchez et al. 2013 ). An uptake of scopoletin regulated by interaction among plant hormones, such as salicylic acid, was also reported  (Taguchi et al. 2001) . 
 Soluble sugar content during PPD Soluble sugar contents detected in cassava roots during PPD are summarized in  Figure 5A -E and  Table S2 .  Figure S4  shows a typical chromatogram of soluble sugars detected in BRA during PPD, and  Figure 5A -E shows changes in soluble sugars, including raffinose, sucrose, glucose, fructose, and total sugars, during storage. Significant differences (P < 0.05) were found in soluble sugar amounts during storage for each cultivar. Raffinose content was observed to decrease in all cultivars, except BRA, which showed a small increase up to the third day of storage  (Fig. 5A) . Decrease in sucrose was also observed, except for ORI where increases were observed until day 3 of storage  (Fig. 5B) . Glucose, fructose, and total sugar content showed similar trends. A small decrease (SAN, IAC), followed, in turn, by increases, was observed in all cultivars studied  (Fig. 5C-E) . Glucose and fructose were the main sugars found in all samples studied. Researchers working with susceptible and tolerant cultivars of cassava stored for 14 days at ambient conditions also reported similar results for soluble sugars . Organic acids during PPD  Figure 6A -D summarizes the results of the organic acid analysis performed. Changes in the contents of these metabolites for the studied cultivars can also be reviewed in  Figure S5  and  Table 3 . The organic acid profiles of cassava roots sampled significantly differed. The main organic acids predominantly found during PPD were succinic and fumaric acids. In PPD-tolerant BRA, succinic acid and malic acid were the major compounds detected  (Fig. 6A ). Small decreases, followed by an increase in succinic acid, were observed in those samples. In ORI  (Fig. 6B) , increases in succinic acid and decreases in fumaric acid during PPD were also observed, while the level of malic acid remained quite constant during PPD. In SAN  (Fig. 6C) , increases in succinic acid up to day 8 of PPD were found; meanwhile, the levels of fumaric and malic acids decreased. For IAC, no trend was detected for succinic and fumaric acids  (Fig. 6D) . The chromatographic profile  (Fig. S3 ) of BRA samples (nonstored) at days 3 and 5 of PPD shows other organic acids detected in small amounts, for example, phytic acid (data not shown). In tolerant clones (BRA/ IAC), we found succinic acid to be the main acid related to PPD; in susceptible cultivars (ORI/SAN), we found that fumaric acid was the main acid related to PPD. As primary metabolic products, organic acids play a regulatory role in plant growth and development. Organic acids are metabolically active solutes in cellular osmoregulation and surplus cationic balance, acting as key components in response to nutritional deficiencies, metal ion accumulation, and plant-microorganism interaction. Organic acids can also enhance resistance to diseases and inhibit oxidation during storage at low temperature, resulting in a significant extension of storage life for plant biomasses  (Sun et al. 2012) . They have also been related to maintenance of membrane integrity in stress conditions  (Gunes et al. 2007 ). Since the postharvest physiological deterioration properties of stored cassava remain largely unknown, studying the metabolic profile of organic acids in postharvest stored cassava roots can lead to a better understanding of PPD. 
 Multivariate statistical analyses Chemometric techniques that include multivariate models (e.g., principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical  Table 3 . HPLC analysis of scopoletin (mmol g −1 ) during PPD in cassava root tubers of the four cassava cultivars studied. Data are represented as mean ± standard deviation of two repetitions (n = 3). Letters in the column represent significant differences (Tukey HSD test, P < 0.05). Values are represented as mean of three repetitions (n = 3) in mmol g −1 of dry weight. Different letters in the column represent significant statistical differences (Tukey HSD, P < 0.05). cluster analysis (HCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and support vector machines (SVM)) can be applied to complex and collinear data to extract relevant information. Both nonsupervised (HCA, PCA) and supervised (PLS-DA, LDA, and SVM) methods reduce large datasets by combining collinear variables into a small number of latent variables (LVs), which are then used in place of the full dataset to build prediction models  (Sills and Gossett 2012; Tang et al. 2014) . When PCA was applied to the scaled data in the present work, a clear separation was noted between nonstored samples and those that had undergone 3 days of PPD. A clear separation between tolerant and susceptible cultivars was found  (Fig. 7A ). The total variance explained by the two principal components was 63.7%, that is, PC1 (37%) and PC2 (26.7%). The loadings plot showed that samples grouped in PC1+/PC2+ according to their values of polyphenol oxidase; in PC2+/PC1− according to fructose, scopoletin, proteins, and ascorbic acid contents; in PC1-/PC2− according to glucose, raffinose, total sugars, and organic acids (malic and succinic acid). Samples grouped in PC1+/PC2− showed similarity in their fumaric acid concentrations. The clustering method was able to separate nonstored (fresh) samples with those at 3 days of storage. Other samples were clustered together on days 5 and 8 of storage based on similar behavior. When a serrated cluster heat map was applied to the data  (Fig. 7B) , results similar to those found in PCA were detected, and four major clusters were detected to occur: group 1 (SAN, ORI, SAN3, and ORI5); group 2 (IAC11, ORI8, ORI11, and SAN8); group 3 (BRA, IAC, ORI3, and BRA3), and group 4 (SAN8, BRA11, BRA5, SAN5, IAC5, BRA8, and IAC8). A cophenetic correlation coefficient of 78.1% was found. The cluster heat map reveals major metabolic components that influenced the clustering noticed. Proteins and ascorbic acid were the major compounds related to group 1, polyphenol oxidase activity for group 2, glucose, succinic acid, and total sugars contents for group 3, and sucrose, raffinose, and malic acid for the last group. Using supervised methods, for example, PLS-DA  (Fig. 7C) , a better separation was found (accuracy of 88.4%), when compared to PCA. BRA grouped with IAC, and ORI grouped with SAN. Most nonstored samples and those at day 3 of storage were found in the same component (xvariate), and those at day 5, 8, and 11 grouped in the same component as their presented similarities. Again, the built model was capable of predicting and separating   tolerant and susceptible cultivars. The total variances explained from the axis were 80.72%, that is, 61.23% from latent variable 1 (x-variate 1) and 19.49% from latent variable 2 (x-variate 2). The loading values showed that samples grouped in x-variate 1+ according to malic and fumaric acids, raffinose, sucrose, and total sugars, while for the x-variate 1-, samples grouped according to the values of glucose, fructose, scopoletin, ascorbic acid, proteins, polyphenol oxidase, and degree of PPD. Samples were also grouped in x-variate 2+ by similar amounts of malic and fumaric acids, ascorbic acid, and polyphenol oxidase, while in x-variate 2-, samples grouped according to the amounts of sugars, succinic acid, scopoletin, and proteins. 
 Conclusions Based on the biochemical data herein presented, metabolic differences in cassava root samples could be correlated with deterioration state and cultivar. Our findings indicate that polyphenol oxidase, ascorbic acid, and proteins are all upregulated in the initial stages of PPD, up to 72 h, and, as such, may related to PPD. Scopoletin biosynthesis is increased at the beginning of the PPD process, but the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Fumaric and succinic acids were the main organic acids found in tolerant (BRA/IAC) and susceptible (ORI/SAN) clones. Our study suggests that PPO, AsA, and proteins may all play a role in PPD delay. We also found that the entire root method worked best for maintaining the postharvest quality as determined by observing samples from the most resilient cultivar to PPD, BRA, and the most susceptible, ORI. Finally, the pattern recognition models, both supervised and unsupervised, classified samples according to their metabolic profiles and degree of deterioration. Cassava roots with lower dry matter have longer shelf life.  Figure S1 . Correlations between PPD with Polyphenol oxidase (A), with Ascorbic acid (B),proteins (C), dry matter (D).  Figure S2 .

Long-term observations already depict robust trends in rainfall frequency and intensity, with many parts of Sahel showing a decreased number of rainy days and an increase in rainfall intensity and extreme heavy rainfall events  [Lodoun et al., 2013; Panthou et al., 2014] . While it is well known that intraseasonal rainfall characteristics, such as long dry spells after sowing  [Sivakumar, 1992] , can be important for yield in this region where more than 95% of all the agriculture is rainfed, it remains unclear whether the specific rainfall changes projected for the next few decades will exert large effects on the major crops of the region. Understanding crop responses to possible shifts in intraseasonal rainfall patterns is useful for at least three reasons. First, when designing crop modeling studies to assess impacts of climate changes, it is important to know which aspects of rainfall are essential to include for agricultural planning. For example, previous studies commonly use only changes in seasonal or annual aggregated total rainfall [e.g.,  Sultan et al., 2013] , a simplification that can facilitate more rapid assessments with multiple crop models [e.g.,  Ruane et al., 2014]  but may miss some critical impacts associated with, for instance, intraseasonal dry spells. Second, if certain aspects of rainfall are particularly important to crops, this knowledge can inform the design of adaptation strategies within agriculture. For example, if increased intensity is especially damaging, adaptations might focus on rainwater harvesting. Third, if the intensity, frequency, and/or seasonality of rainfall are important for crops, this knowledge could help prioritize climate research needs toward reducing uncertainties in simulating those aspects that are most relevant. The idea that intraseasonal rainfall characteristics are important for crop modeling is not new, but previous work mostly focused on how the errors in these rainfall features in climate data sets propagate into crop simulations. Typical gridded climate data, from satellite retrievals, reanalysis, or climate model outputs, usually suffer from too much drizzle and a large bias in rainfall frequency (up to 100%)  [Baron et al., 2005; Berg et al., 2010; Ramarohetra et al., 2013] , which can subsequently bias simulated crop yield. Though the absolute magnitudes of rainfall characteristics simulated by climate models may have their biases  [Crétat et al., 2013] , the simulated relative change in intraseasonal rainfall characteristics under various climate change scenarios could be more reliable and indeed it is our best guidance for projecting future changes  [Glotter et al., 2014] . The projected changes of intraseasonal rainfall characteristics in Africa from historical GUAN ET AL. CROP SENSITIVITY TO RAINFALL FEATURES 1 and RCP8.5 scenario simulations from 16 models (see Appendix A) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5)  [Taylor et al., 2012a]  are shown in  Figure 1 . We adopt the approach detailed in section 2.3 (also see the supporting information for how to derive ""rainy season length"") to analyze projected changes in rainfall characteristics between the periods 1961-1990 and 2061-2090 (individual model patterns can be found in  Figure S10  in the supporting information). Focusing on West Africa (box in  Figure 1 ), we have the following findings: (i) an overall rainy season delay in the whole region (significant delay in both start and end of rainy season and insignificant changes in total rainy season length; ""significant"" means that 70% of all the models show the same sign of changes), consistent with previous findings  [Biasutti and Sobel, 2009; Biasutti, 2013] ; (ii) an overall increase in rainfall intensity (0-15%) and an overall decrease of rainfall frequency (À5%À20%) across nearly the whole region; and (iii) a dipole pattern in the projected mean annual precipitation (MAP) change; i.e., the east part of West Africa has an increase in MAP attributing to a large increase in rainfall intensity as well as a slight increase of rainy season length, and the west part of West Africa exhibits decreased MAP mostly due to the decrease of rainfall frequency. In this paper, we design a new stochastic rainfall model to synthetically generate different rainfall change scenarios that are relevant to the projected rainfall changes in CMIP5  (Figure 1 ) at the 35 stations spanning West Africa. We then use these synthetic climate variables to drive two regionally calibrated and validated crop models to understand how different aspects of intraseasonal rainfall variability affect the yield of sorghum, one of the main staple crops in the Sudanian and Sahelian savannas of West Africa. We employ two crop models to reduce the model-dependent uncertainty and increase the robustness of the simulation results. To separate rainfall effects from other important factors, we use the historical-level temperatures and atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. Our results are not sensitive to this choice: we conducted additional simulations, using a higher  Figure 1 .

This assures that the interactions between the changes of intraseasonal rainfall characteristics and temperature or CO 2 concentrations have little impact on our conclusions related to yield responses to intraseasonal rainfall characteristics. We also assess the responses of two sorghum cultivars, representing traditional and modern types which mainly differ in their photoperiod sensitivity (thus the growing length) and potential yields  [Sultan et al., 2014] . 
 Methods 
 Study Area and Meteorological Station Data Our study area covers West Africa, which is an important food production area in Africa, spanning from 18°W to 5°W in longitude and 10°N to 18°N in latitude (highlighted in dashed black box in  Figure 1 ). We focus on 35 sites where daily meteorological observations have been compiled by the AGRHYMET Regional Center and National Meteorological Agencies for the 1961-1990 period. Daily rainfall, solar radiation, surface wind speed, humidity, and temperature were measured. These 35 sites span the whole region and cover a wide range of annual total rainfall from 250 mm/yr to 2100 mm/yr (  Figure S1 ). 
 Two Crop Models and Two Major Cultivars We employ two different crop models in this study to simulate sorghum yields: SARRA-H (version 3.2)  and APSIM (version 7.5)  [Hammer et al., 2010] , both of which have been calibrated with the same field trial data  Traoré et al., 2011]  and have been tested against regional crop statistics  [Sultan et al., 2014] . Both models incorporate processes of soil water balance, plant carbon assimilation, and biomass partitioning. One major distinction between the two crop models is that APSIM can simulate nitrogen stress on crop production. Though both models include mechanisms to simulate photoperiod sensitivity of crop growth, their approaches differ  Kumar et al., 2009] , which may induce different responses to the shifts of rainy season. Detailed overviews of the two models and a description of soil parameters used can be found in  Sultan et al. [2014] . Because the importance of intraseasonal rainfall characteristics could vary depending on the growth patterns of different crop cultivars, we simulate two well-known local sorghum cultivars in our study. The traditional cultivar has moderate to strong photoperiod sensitivity  and a longer crop cycle length (~150 days from sowing to maturity) but smaller average yields. The modern cultivar is an early-maturing, short-duration (~95 days from sowing to maturity), and photoperiod-insensitive crop selected to maximize the mean yield under optimal fertility conditions. On-farm surveys in West Africa  [Traoré et al., 2011]  indicate that a large majority of farmers in West African countries use the traditional cultivar, with a small fraction of farmers having adopted the modern cultivar. 
 Stochastic Rainfall Model and Weather Generator To quantify crop yield responses to seasonal rainfall variability, we first design a new stochastic rainfall model based on Guan et al. [2014a] but adding explicit time-varying parameters of rainfall frequency and rainfall intensity, which implicitly include the phase and length information of rainy season. In the approach of  Guan et al. [2014a] , a daily rainfall time series for a continuous period is simulated as a marked Poisson process  [Rodriguez-Iturbe et al., 1999] . The arrival of rainfall events is a Poisson process; i.e., the distribution of time t between rainfall events is exponential with mean 1/λ, and λ is estimated as the mean of rainfall frequency (events/day): f t (τ) = λe À λτ , for τ ≥ 0 (with τ as dummy variable). The depth of rainfall events is exponentially distributed with mean α, and α is estimated as the mean of rainfall depth only from the rainy days (mm/event): f H h ð Þ ¼ 1 α e À 1 α h ; for h≥0 (with h as the dummy variable). A rainy day is defined when total daily rainfall is more than 0 mm/d, and we consider one rainy day as one rainfall event (i.e., there is no consideration of subdaily rainfall events, which is consistent with the time step of crop model input). Thus, the cumulative total rainfall for a certain period τ i has the mean of λ i α i τ i (mm), with subscript i referring to a specific period. To capture seasonal variations in both rainfall frequency and intensity, we estimate λ and α for each day of the year (DOY, DOY = 1-365) centered at a moving window of 21 days (10 days at each side) from the whole historical rainfall periods. That is, we join all rainfall records within this DOY window period and treat the Geophysical Research Letters 10.1002/2015GL063877 newly formed rainfall sequence as a statistically homogeneous time series, from which we estimate the corresponding λ and α for this DOY period.  Figure S2  shows an example of derived rainfall frequency and intensity from a 30 year daily rainfall record from a site in West Africa. Based on the above definition, we do not need to explicitly estimate rainy season length, as the time-varying rainfall frequency and intensity have implicitly included the seasonal magnitude and phase information. We then use the mean of the estimated daily λ and α for this period (here 20 days as an interval) to represent the aggregated rainfall characteristics and use the marked Poisson process to generate synthetic rainfall time series. We repeat this step for each 20 day interval from the first day to the last day of the year. Our rainfall model can well capture both the total amount (slope = 0.99, R 2 = 0.997, p < 10 À5 ) and seasonal variation (slope = 0.82, R 2 = 0.975, p < 10 À5 ) for rainy seasons across the 35 sites in our study area (  Figure S3 ). We focus on the seasonal-scale rainfall rather than interannual variation, as the focus of this study is related to crop yield response to intraseasonal rainfall variation. It is worth noting that our rainfall model has a light underestimation in seasonal variation, mostly due to the assumption of stochastic distribution of rainfall intensity. We chose an exponential distribution here  [Rodriguez-Iturbe et al., 1999 ], which may not be able to simulate very heavy rainfall events (due to the thin tail of exponential distribution). Using more heavy-tail distributions can solve this issue, though we do not expect a significant difference in our results, as the current approach captures the majority (82%) of the rainy season rainfall variability. Uncertainties of estimated λ are small (<5%) and well constrained across the whole year (  Figure S2 ). Uncertainties of estimated α are small during the rainy season and only become large during dry season due to too few samples in these periods. We thus force dry season α to be zero (the ""dry season"" is defined in the supporting information). The setup of our rainfall model makes it easy to manipulate intraseasonal rainfall characteristics. Rainfall frequency or intensity changes are realized by multiplying the baseline values with a scaling factor. To change rainy season length, we first derive the center of the rainy season based on the concept of  Markham [1970]  (see supporting information) and then proportionally extend or shrink the baseline rainfall frequency and intensity from the center of rainy season to the two ends of the rainy season. After the extension (e.g., 1 year rainfall record after 10% extension in length would yield a time series of 365 × 1.1 = 402 days), we simply truncate these parts that exceed the length of a year at the two sides. Similarly, after a shrinkage, we fill zero values on both sides, assuming that the dry season has no rainfall events. By doing so, we are able to lengthen or shorten the rainy season length and meanwhile preserve the seasonal pattern of rainfall frequency and intensity. To shift the rainy season (e.g., delay or advance), we move the rainfall frequency and intensity forward or backward and do the same truncation and zero filling as before. After generating the rainfall time series, to preserve the covariance between rainfall and other climate variables, we conditionally resample other climate variables from the historical climate record. In particular, for a specific DOY, we search the historical record within 10 days of the targeted DOY and look for the date whose rainfall record best matches the synthetic rainfall amount in terms of the smallest absolute difference. If there is more than one suitable sample in the historical pool, we randomly choose one. Then we take all climate variables except rainfall of that chosen day to complete the synthetic weather record. To further account for the uncertainties arising from our stochastic rainfall model and the weather resampling approach, we also generate multiple realizations of rainfall and the corresponding climate forcing for each specific type of rainfall change (see details in section 2.4). The simulated crop yields from both APSIM and SARRA-H forced by historical climate observation and forced by our synthetically generated climate based on the derived historical rainfall characteristics are highly consistent (  Figure S4 ). The latter simulation is also called the ""baseline"" run. 
 Experiments Design and Implementation Based on the projected rainfall changes  (Figure 1) , we design the three following experiments using the framework of our stochastic rainfall model (i.e., seasonal total rainfall = λ × α × τ, where λ is rainfall frequency, α is rainfall intensity, and τ is rainy season length): Experiment  (1) : Total annual rainfall changed by ±10%, by varying only one of the three rainfall characteristics (i.e., λ i , α i , or τ i ). 
 Geophysical Research Letters 
 10.1002/2015GL063877 Experiment  (2) : We fix total annual rainfall but vary ±30% of rainfall frequency with corresponding change in rainfall intensity to keep the total annual rainfall the same. Experiment (3): Without changing total annual rainfall, we delay the phase of rainy season by 10% of its original season length. Experiment (1) mainly tests whether crop yields are sensitive to different realizations for the same change in total annual rainfall amount. The range of change used in Experiment (1) (i.e., ±10%) is based on the ensemble projections from the CMIP5 models (  Figure 1 ). Experiment (2) further studies the relative importance of rainfall frequency and intensity change under a fixed annual rainfall total. We choose ±30% of rainfall frequency because this is the upper bound of future climate projections  (Figure 1 ), and such variations in rainfall intensity have also been observed in the study region during the period of 1970 to 2000  [Lodoun et al., 2013] . We also checked the results of only varying ±10% or ±20%, and we find similar patterns but with smaller magnitude. Experiment (3) addresses yield responses to rainy season delays of a magnitude which is anticipated in West Africa  (Figure 1 ). Since the synthetic weather generator is based on a stochastic process, for each simulation we generate 15 ensembles to drive two crop models and use the ensemble mean of crop-simulated yields for the analysis. The ensemble number is set as 15 as more ensembles start to reach a plateau in marginal benefit (  Figure S5 ). Two models have similar sowing rules, and both are based on the rainfall amount and soil moisture status at the beginning of the rainy season  [Sultan et al., 2014] . Thus, sowing date mostly follows the trend of rainy season onset. We fix the atmospheric CO 2 concentration to be 350 ppm for all the simulations. For APSIM we only show the results with a fertilizer rate of 50 kg/ha. Simulations with a low fertilizer rate of 10 kg/ha show very similar responses to changes in rainfall characteristics.   (1) ), which is realized through the changes in rainfall frequency, rainfall intensity, and rainy season length. Each point corresponds to the results from a station. The y axis means that if there is a 1% change in total rainfall, it would lead to 1% × relative yield change (y axis value) of the crop yield. The dashed lines are the robust Lowess fits for the results. The insets show the averaged pattern of all 35 sites for the three scenarios, with median (red line) and 25% and 75% quantiles (as the lower and upper bounds) indicated. 
 Geophysical Research Letters 10.1002/2015GL063877 
 Results The results of Experiment (1) reveal that crop yield response to a change in MAP is primarily a function of the baseline total annual rainfall, with relatively small sensitivity to what rainfall characteristic was changed to achieve the MAP change (  Figure 2 ). Both crop models show consistent patterns: simulated yields respond alike to the same percentage change in rainfall frequency, rainfall intensity, and rainy season length for a given cultivar. The yield-MAP fitted curves by robust Lowess fits for the three rainfall characteristics have a similar trend: simulated yields have larger relative change at low MAP and become less sensitive at higher MAP. It is worth noting that the patterns shown in  Figure 1  is 1~4 times larger than the uncertainties of the ensemble simulation for baseline condition (  Figure S6 ), meaning that the detected signal is robust. Although responses to changes in the three rainfall characteristics are broadly similar, some differences are apparent at both high and low MAP. At very high MAP (>1500 mm), APSIM yields decrease with higher frequency or intensity, though SARRA-H shows little yield response. This unique response of APSIM is related to its nitrogen sensitivity, which is not considered in SARRA-H. At high MAP, additional rainfall increases nitrogen leaching and results in elevated nitrogen stress. APSIM captures this response in its measure of the ratio of nitrogen supply to plant demand (""nitrogenSD""), which increases by~30% for the two highest MAP sites at a higher frequency or intensity case. At low MAP, both models indicate that yields benefit more from increases in intensity than in frequency or rainy season length  (Figure 2 ). This is confirmed in Experiment  (2) , where we fix the MAP but vary rainfall frequency and intensity simultaneously  (Figure 3 , top row). At low MAP (below~600 mm/yr in APSIM or below~500 mm/yr in SARRA-H), corresponding to the semiarid conditions of the northern Sahel, higher rainfall frequency leads to a lower crop yield (À80%-0%). This negative difference becomes smaller with increased MAP, and beyond 600 mm/yr in APSIM (or 500 mm/yr in SARRA-H), higher frequency starts to have comparable or slightly better effects than the same percentage increase in intensity.  
 Geophysical Research Letters 
 10.1002/2015GL063877 The above results can be largely explained by the simulated hydrological fluxes from the two models (  Figure 3 , bottom row). With increased rainfall frequency and correspondingly reduced intensity (i.e., Experiment (2)), simulated evapotranspiration (ET) increases overall because of reduced runoff. However, at low MAP, it is only the evaporation (E, from both canopy interception and shallow soil moisture) that increases, reducing soil moisture supply that can be used by crops. Crop transpiration (T) is reduced accordingly, limiting plant photosynthesis and growth. Thus, higher frequency (and meanwhile lower intensity) of rainfall reduces yield when MAP is below 600 mm/yr in APSIM (below 500 mm/yr for SARRA-H). Differences between the responses of traditional and modern cultivars are similar across both models. For all but the lowest MAP, the traditional cultivars have higher yield increases under the same increase of rainy season length than the modern cultivar (blue points and lines in  Figure 2 ). Under an increased rainy season length (i.e., advanced onset and delayed end of rainy season), both cultivars are sown earlier in the models. However, the modern cultivar has a short growth cycle and weak photoperiod sensitivity; thus, it correspondingly matures earlier, leading to an overall advanced growing cycle with little change in its total growth length. In contrast, the traditional photoperiod-sensitive cultivar matures at the similar time as before and have a longer growth cycle, and thus can better take the advantage of the increased rainy season length and increased total rainfall amount. Finally, we focus on the yield response to a delayed rainy season (10% of the rainy season length at each site, Experiment (3)). The consistent pattern is that both models show a yield decrease in this scenario. Meanwhile, two models simulate different sensitivities between cultivars: in APSIM, traditional cultivars are the worst affected, while in SARRA-H the modern cultivars show the largest decrease in yield. These distinct behaviors are due to differences in the model parameterization of sorghum's photoperiod sensitivity. Sorghum is a short-day plant; i.e., it develops more rapidly on short days  [Major, 1980] , and this photoperiod sensitivity usually occurs prior to floral initiation  [Alagarswamy et al., 1998 ]. APSIM adopts a linear relationship between plant thermal requirements (i.e., growing degree day, GDD) and day length  [Kumar et al., 2009]  and uses field phenology observation to calibrate the parameters. A delayed rainy season leads to a corresponding delay in sowing and thus also, for all early-sowing sites, shift the plant's growth period into a time of year with longer days (  Figure S7 ). This causes an increase of the GDD thermal requirement and a lengthening of the growth cycle. The growth of traditional cultivars lengthens the most, due to a stronger photoperiod sensitivity (simulated as a larger slope for the GDD-day length relationship). The longer growth cycle generally causes a yield loss in APSIM, mostly because a further extension of the growth cycle may lead to more water stress for the plants that are still growing after the end of the rainy season. This is illustrated by the simulated water stress (""waterSD,""  Figure S8 ), which is highly correlated with the yield changes in APSIM. SARRA-H adopts a more complex algorithm to parameterize the photoperiod sensitivity, which includes both the day length and the crop's existing thermal history, yet the parameterization depends on calibration to existing varieties . In our hypothetical scenario of a delayed rainy season, APSIM dynamically adapts to different regions by changing the latitude-dependent day length, while SARRA-H has no appropriate data to calibrate the effects of different day lengths. Thus, SARRA-H simulates smaller variations in growing length in links with latitude change, i.e., a nearly fixed maturity date for all sites in the current study. Therefore, in SARRA-H, a delayed rainy season for the traditional cultivar would not change the total rainfall that crops receive during their growing cycle (the harvest time in SARRA-H is usually later than the end of rainy season), which leads to little change in yield  (Figure 4b) . The reason for a yield loss of modern varieties under a delayed rainy season remains less clear, and it is less relevant due to the limited calibration in SARRA-H for the scenario of a delayed rainy season. Given the difference between the cultivars in two models, it is worth emphasizing a robust pattern: across all these situations, yield loss happens after a delay of rainy season. 
 Discussion Our results from Experiment (1) generally provide a justification for focusing on seasonal total rainfall as a first-order predictor to assess rainfall impacts on yields. Simulations from both crop models confirm that different intraseasonal rainfall characteristics, within a plausible range based on climate model projections, have relatively smaller impacts. This contrasts somewhat with the reported large impacts of rainfall frequency by  Berg et al. [2010] , which compared simulations using raw gridded daily climate products versus data that had been corrected to have realistic rainfall frequencies. The main distinction is that our experiment varies rainfall frequency over a relatively narrow range intended to be consistent with future climate projections (±10% change of the climatological range), whereas  Berg et al. [2010]  varied rainfall frequency up to 100%. Thus, although it is important to not have completely unrealistic rainfall frequencies (as many climate model simulations have), fairly small changes over the next few decades are unlikely to matter much, except at the very dry sites (with MAP below 500-600 mm/yr, which is discussed below). One unexpected result from Experiment (1) is that crops have a much smaller response in yield to an increased rainy season length than natural savanna ecosystems  [Guan et al., 2014a [Guan et al., , 2014b . This difference mainly arises from different phenological controls between natural grasslands and crops. The growing period of the former is mostly determined by rainy season; thus, a lengthening of the rainy season translates to a longer growing season and higher productivity. Instead, the phenology of crops follows accumulative thermal conditions and photoperiods, and their growing length has less dependency on the rainy season length. This finding may also have some important implications for other dryland agriculture, such as those in the southern part of the African continent, where future climate projections show a robust rainy season shortening  (Figure 1 ). Whether those drylands have similar responses to the rainy season length change is worth further investigation but is beyond the scope of the current study. Despite the first-order importance of aggregated rainfall amount, our study from Experiment (2) identifies a secondary importance of rainfall frequency and intensity at MAP below 600 mm/yr (for APSIM and 500 mm/yr for SARRA-H). More frequent rainy days were traditionally thought to be beneficial for plant growth [e.g.,  Good and Caylor, 2011] . However, in West Africa, low MAP usually corresponds to low rainfall frequency  [Guan et al., 2014a] . Both crop models simulate runoff based on the saturation-excess mechanism, which essentially treats the soil column as a bucket: when the water storage capacity of the soil is met, runoff ensues. This approximation is reasonable considering that the infiltration-excess mechanism for runoff can be ignored at the daily timescale that is used for both crop models. Our results show that further increasing frequency at low MAP leads to less penetration of rainfall into deep soil layers and more evaporation from both shallow soil layer and canopy interception, thus reducing the available soil moisture for plant water use and causing crop yield loss. Therefore, the benefits of reduced runoff are apparently outweighed by the costs of higher evaporation. The benefits of more frequent rainfall only emerge when MAP is larger than Geophysical Research Letters 10.1002/2015GL063877 600 mm/yr (for APSIM and 500 mm/yr for SARRA-H) in our study, consistent with many previous findings  [Thomey et al., 2011; Guan et al., 2014a] ; by then the increased rainfall frequency would effectively reduce the intervals between low soil moisture states, thus reducing plant water stress  [Porporato et al., 2004] . We thus conclude that the projected increase of rainfall intensity in West Africa  (Figure 1 ) has a potential benefit for crop yields at drier sites. It is worth noting that our results are dependent on the model structure. In particular, the two crop models only simulate saturation-excess runoff at the daily scale and could not simulate infiltration-excess runoff, which may be important at the subdaily or hourly scale  [Dingman, 2008] . Both models also do not explicitly simulate the groundwater dynamics, which for our study area is a reasonable assumption as the groundwater table is usually much deeper than crop roots in this area  [Fan et al., 2013] ; there is no major aquifer system in West Africa  [Taylor et al., 2012b] , and few pumping irrigation systems have been adopted for low-value sorghum production  [MacDonald et al., 2012] . Different parameterizations of hydrological processes may lead to inconsistent results, and thus, we recommend that future studies evaluate these types of effects in semiarid environments like West Africa. The effect of a 10% delay of rainy season (Experiment  (3) ) is a yield loss for all cultivars, but whether modern or traditional varieties are more susceptible is less clear, due to the different parameterizations for photoperiod sensitivity in the two models. Because that SARRA-H only uses one photoperiodic variety in West Africa while APSIM adopts a latitude-dependent photoperiod parameterization, we are more confident in the APSIM-simulated yield responses to the delay of rainy season: a relatively small response for the modern cultivar due to its weak photoperiod sensitivity but a significant yield decrease (i.e., À10%) for the traditional cultivar due to elevated water stress at the end of rainy season. This yield change in most dry sites is similar in magnitude to yield changes caused by ±10% change in other rainfall characteristics (i.e., rainfall frequency, intensity, and length). This demonstrates that rainy season delay, or rainy season phase shifts, in general, may have a nonnegligible impact on crop yield. When combining this change with a warming temperature (which shortens growth cycle), a delayed rainy season may result in a more complex change  [Sultan et al., 2014]  (also see  Figure S9  in the supporting information). 
 Conclusion Our study provides a comprehensive assessment of how different seasonal-scale rainfall characteristics affect sorghum yields in West Africa, by combining a new synthetic rainfall model and two independently validated crop models. Overall, our results support the idea that the influence of rainfall on crop yield is primarily dictated by the total rainfall amount during the rainy season. However, dry regions also have a large sensitivity to specific intraseasonal rainfall characteristics, with more drizzle (i.e., more frequent but less intense rainfall) leading to a yield loss. Only when MAP is higher than 600 mm/yr (for APSIM and 500 mm/yr for SARRA-H) does more frequent rainfall bring benefits to crop yield. A delayed rainy season, in general, leads to a yield loss for most dry sites in West Africa. Overall, we believe that our results have important implications for the design of future climate impact studies for rainfed agriculture and also provide information relevant for designing specific crop adaptations in West Africa.

 Introduction Gene expression analysis has been widely used to explore biological processes related to plant developmental and environmental cues. The accumulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) is measured using a rapid, sensitive and reliable method. Currently, a fluorescence based-PCR such as Reverse Transcriptase Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is a powerful technique in order to detect low abundance of mRNA in the cell  (Exner, 2010; Rebouças et al., 2013) . The precise result expected through this method depends on several factors including the quantity and quality of samples collected, RNA, cDNA and the specificity of used primers  (Udvardi et al., 2008) . In most cases, the measurement of transcript abundance is relative to the control of expression such as housekeeping genes (18S rRNA, glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate (GADPH), elongation factor-1a (EF-1a), polyubiquitin (UBI), actin (Act), tubulin (TUB), etc)  (Mitter et al., 2009) . Therefore, the reliability of RT-qPCR depends essentially to the choice of these internal controls which are called reference genes after validation against several criteria  (Derveaux et al., 2010) . However, housekeeping or reference genes have never been identified to be stable across different tissue types or under different experimental conditions  (Kozera & Rapacz, 2013) . That is the reason why a prior validation of reference genes is suggested for every set of cDNAs used in a new RT-qPCR experiment  (Li et al., 2011) . Furthermore, many RT-qPCR analyses were performed on multiple internal control genes for an accurate normalization of expression values using statistical algorithms such as geNorm and NormFinder  (Vandesompele et al., 2002; Andersen et al., 2004) . Both of these algorithms calculate the expression stability of multiple reference genes under different experimental conditions. As an alternative, the use of the coefficient of variation (CV) proposed by  Hellemans et al. (2007)  can be considered as a simple method to obtain indication of reference gene stability. Hevea brasiliensis is the sole commercial source of natural rubber. The rubber biosynthetic pathway occurs in specialized latex cells. Latex, a cytoplasmic component of laticifers, is a colloidal suspension that contains 30 to 50% dry matter, of which 90% is rubber  (Chrestin et al., 1997) . Latex is expelled after bark tapping (cutting of soft bark). For certain rubber clones with a low latex metabolism, application of ethephon to the bark stimulates latex flow and latex regeneration between two tappings  (d'Auzac et al., 1997) . Tolerance of this harvesting system allows rubber tree to produce daily latex production. However, genetic aspects and environment adaptations (abiotic and biotic stress, soil compaction, etc.) are equally an important factor for sustainable natural rubber production  (Jacob, 2005) . In past few years, gene expression studies using RT-qPCR rather than other techniques have been preferably carried out in rubber tree  (Li et al., 2011) . These studies aimed to differentiate gene expression in order to understand physiological mechanisms and responses underlying the latex production during biotic and abiotic stress  (Putranto et al., 2015b; Putranto et al., 2015a; Putranto et al., 2014; Piyatrakul et al., 2014; Putranto et al., 2012; Duan et al., 2010; Qin et al., 2014; Aoki et al,. 2014; Xiao et al., 2014; Pirrello et al., 2014; Gébelin et al., 2013) . Study of Hevea brasiliensis reference genes has been initiated by  Li et al. (2011)  revealing a set of internal control usable for RT-qPCR in genotype and environmental aspects. A more specific study of the reference gene stability during latex regeneration has been carried out by  Long et al. (2015) . Even though these results were fully useful, both of these studies were focused on latex as samples undergoing anthropogenic harvesting stress. Information about the expression of reference gene at different tissue is not yet elucidated. Furthermore, the stability of reference genes has not yet been characterized during water deficit in Hevea brasiliensis. This work is complementary to previous studies done for reference gene stability prior to RT-qPCR analysis in Hevea brasiliensis by  Li et al. (2011) and Long et al. (2015) . This study aimed to analyze the internal control stability of eleven selected housekeeping genes during 15 days of moderate water deficit in three Hevea brasiliensis tissues (leaf, bark and root). Firstly, the quality and quantity of total RNA was compared between control and stressed-plants. Secondly, cDNA synthesis was validated by PCR amplification using primer pair encoding HbActin. Thirdly, the eleventh primers encoding Hevea housekeeping genes were validated using PCR amplification. Fourthly, the value of Crossing-point (Cp) was measured using a second derivative method after RT-qPCR analysis for each day 0 (D0), day 5 (D5) and day 15 (D15) of water deficit. Fifth, rank stability for these reference genes during each measurement was determined using coefficient of variation (CV) method. A small number of housekeeping genes showed a stable expression during 15 days of water deficit in Hevea brasiliensis. The successful CV method emphasized the use of simple and yet reliable analysis to determine reference gene stability for RT-qPCR. 
 Material and Methods 
 Plant material In vitro plantlets aged 7-months-old of clone PB260 with line CI07069 were obtained using somatic embryogenesis method developed by  Lardet et al. (2009) . The plantlets were acclimatized and grown in a greenhouse of CIRAD, Montpellier at a temperature of 27°C with 45% relative humidity. The treatment of water deficit was carried out by subjecting dehydration to the tested plants until a moderate-water stress was reached (a value of FTSW 0.4)  (Putranto et al., 2012) . Leaf, bark and root tissues were collected at day 0 (D0), day 5 (D5) and day 15 (D15) after dehydration treatment. The samples were conserved at -80°C until RNA extraction. 
 Total RNA isolation Total RNAs were isolated using the caesium chloride cushion method adapted from  Sambrook et al. (1989)  by  Duan et al. (2010) . One gram of fresh matter was ground and transferred to a tube containing 30 mL of extraction buffer consisting of 4 M guanidiumisothiocyanate, 1% sarcosine, 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone and 1% ß-mercapto-ethanol. After homogenization, tubes were kept on ice and then centrifuged at 10,000 g at 4°C for 30 minutes. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube containing 8 mL of 5.7 M CsCl. Ultracentrifugation in a swinging bucket was carried out at 89,705 g at 20°C for 20 hours. The supernatant and caesium cushion were discarded whilst the RNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol. After 30 minutes of air drying, the pellet was dissolved in 200 µL of sterile water. Although DNA could not cross the caesium cushion for this centrifugation condition, DNA contamination was checked by PCR amplification using primers of the HbActin gene including the intron sequence. The quantity of RNAs was measured using Infinite® 200 NanoQuant (Tecan, Switzerland). RNAs were conserved at -80°C. 
 Validation of primers Primers used in this paper have been tested in previous experiments for its specificity by Real-Time PCR and by sequencing of PCR product  (Putranto et al., 2015a; Piyatrakul et al., 2014; Putranto et al., 2012) . PCR amplification was carried out using a mix of cDNAs in order to validate the integrity of each pair of primers related to eleven Hevea brasiliensis reference genes  (HbActin, HbelF1Aa, HbUBC4, HbUBC2b, HbYLS8, HbRH2b, HbRH8, HbUBC2a, HbαTub, Hb40S and HbUBI) . The list of primers is provided in  Table 1 . 
 cDNA synthesis and Reverse Transcriptase Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) setup cDNAs were synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA to the final 20 μL reaction mixture using a RevertAidTM M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (RT) kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (MBI, Fermentas, Canada). Full-length cDNA synthesis was checked on each cDNA sample by PCR amplification of the Actin cDNA using primers at the cDNA ends. Reverse Transcriptase quantitative PCR was finally carried out using a Light Cycler 480 (Roche, Switzerland). The RT-qPCR reaction mixtures consisted of 2 µL RT product cDNA, 0.6 µL of 5 µM of each primer, and 3 µL 2×SYBR green PCR master mix (LightCycler® 480 SYBR Green I Master, Roche Applied Sciences) in a 6-µL volume. PCR cycling conditions comprised one denaturation cycle at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 45 amplification cycles (95°C for 20 s, 60°C for 15s, and 72°C for 20s).Real-Time PCR was done at 96-well plate. 
 Data analysis using coefficient of variation The values of Crossing-point (Cp) were obtained in the end of PCR process. The determination of stability rank for each reference gene was calculated using coefficient of variation (CV). The CV is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean  (Hellemans et al., 2007; de Jonge et al., 2007) . The CV values were presented in percentage at D0, D5 and D15 sampling points. 
 Results and Discussion 
 Validation of total RNA yield cDNA and primer pairs by PCR amplification The validation of RNA integrity is an important preliminary stage in the analysis of gene expression. The quality and quantity of RNA determines largely the quality and quantity of synthesized cDNA  (Fleige & Pfaffl, 2006; Fleige et al., 2006) . In this work, total RNA was isolated from each 9 samples of control and stressed-plants, respectively, counting in total 18 samples (  Table 2 ). The RNA quantification using Nanoquant showed that its concentration and purity met the requirement for transcript accumulation analysis by RT-qPCR. The purity of total RNA samples (ratio of 260/280 nm) was measured from 1.77-1.93 while the RNA concentrations ranged from 0.462-8.000 µg/µl. The yield of total RNA obtained was afterward calculated by adjusting the weight of each sampled tissue. The yield of total RNA in leaf was 10.497 and 11.590 µg/g of fresh leaf from control and stressed-plants, respectively. The yield of total RNA in bark was 7.535 and 15.036 µg/g of fresh bark from control and stressed-plants, respectively. The yield of total RNA in root was 5.758 and 9.678 µg/g of fresh root from control and stressed-plants, respectively. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference of total RNA yield between tissues or between treatments (control and stressed-plants). The quality of cDNA synthesized using reverse transcriptase enzyme can be validated by PCR amplification using the primer of housekeeping gene such as HbActin  (Putranto et al., 2012) . The total 18 cDNA samples showed a thick-positive band of HbActin gene (195 bp) in agarose gel electrophoresis  (Figure 1 ). The PCR reaction was assured by the amplification of positive control, a plasmid containing HbActin gene. Prior to RT-qPCR analysis, eleven pairs of primer encoding Hevea reference genes were validated by PCR amplification. PCR results showed specific DNA fragment for each pair of primer ranging from 192-221 bp  (Figure 2 ). In addition, the validation of primer pairs can also be done by measuring the melting temperature (Tm) in Real-Time PCR. Single curve indicates a specific PCR product related to DNA fragment of interest (Rebouças et al., 2013). 
 Measurement of Crossing-point (Cp) values during water deficit The baseline and quantification of cycle reaching the threshold of fluorescence, usually (Roche) for day 0 (D0), day 5 (D5) and day 15 (D15) in control and stressed-plants. Since the Cp values occurred at the exponential phase of qPCR, they were considered as an accurate indication of efficient amplification  (Luu-The et al., 2005) . In this experiment, the Cp values were calculated using a second derivative method. A positive peak corresponds to the beginning of the log-linear phase defined the Cp value. The Cp values for eleven housekeeping genes encoding reference genes in Hevea brasiliensis have been defined for each sampling point (D0, D5 and D15)  (Figure 3 ). The mean of Cp values at D0 for HbActin,  HbelF1Aa, HbUBC4, HbUBC2b, HbUBC2a, HbYLS8, HbRH2b, HbRH8, HbαTUB, Hb40S, HbUBI was 18.868, 19.597, 21.578, 22.563, 21.665, 22.513, 21.006, 22.071, 22.849, 23.357 and 28.383, respectively. The mean of Cp values at D5 for HbActin, HbelF1Aa, HbUBC4, HbUBC2b, HbUBC2a, HbYLS8, HbRH2b, HbRH8, HbαTUB, Hb40S, HbUBI was 29.437, 22.171, 31.684, 31.304, 27.038, 27.520, 25.066, 31.335, 25.643, 27.998, and 31 .717, respectively. The mean of Cp values at D15 for HbActin,  HbelF1Aa, HbUBC4, HbUBC2b, HbUBC2a, HbYLS8, HbRH2b, HbRH8, HbαTUB, Hb40S, HbUBIwas 19.557, 21.133, 24.288, 23.315, 21.786, 22.769, 22.403, 23.787, 23.382, 22.689 and 27.086, respectively.  According to  Barsalobres-Cavallari et al. (2009)     Figure 3) . In general, the mean of Cp values for these housekeeping genes at D5 sampling point was significantly higher than D0 and D15 sampling points. For five housekeeping genes such as  HbelF1Aa, HbUBC4, HbRH2b, HbRH8  and HbUBI, the Cp values were significantly different between D0, D5 and D15  (Figure 3) . These results highlighted the review of  Kozera & Rapacz (2013)  concerning real stable expression of reference gene has never been recorded. It underlined once again the importance of prior analysis in order to look for a stable reference gene before RT-qPCR analysis. 
 Stability rank of reference genes during water deficit The coefficient of variation (CV) is used as a statistic for comparing the degree of variation between genes, even if the mean expressions are drastically different from each other. The CV equals the standard deviation divided by the mean, normally expressed as a percentage  (Hellemans et al., 2007; de Jonge et al., 2007) . The value of CV reflects the level of biological variation in the sample population. Lower CV value of a housekeeping gene is related to the low variation in a set of sample population meaning higher stability to be used as a normalization factor in RT-qPCR analysis  (Wang et al., 2014) . In this work, the calculated CVs for tested reference genes were ranked at D0, D5 and D15 sampling points  (Table 3 ). The ranking results at D0 sampling point indicate that HbRH2b, HbRH8 and HbUBC4 had the most stable expression across tissues (leaf, bark and root) and conditions (control      (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2015) . 92 .Evaluation of eleven reference genes for Reverse Transcriptase Quantitative PCR……  (Putranto et al.)   b c c b b b c c b b b a a a 
 Conclusion In general, the results obtained in this work reconfirmed the necessity of prior analysis for reference genes before RT-qPCR due to the instability of housekeeping genes at different tissue compartments or experimental conditions. The evaluation of these reference genes should improve the possibility of having more accurate relative transcript accumulation of target genes. Despite the usage reinforcement of multiple softwares to select reference genes appropriate for each experiment, the work presented in this paper demonstrated a simple but reliable analysis using CV method to assess Hevea reference genes before RT-qPCR analysis. Finally, it can be concluded that five housekeeping genes  (HbRH2b, HbRH8, HbUBC4   called Crossing-point (Cp) were automatically determined by the LightCycler 4.

 Diterima tanggal 21 September 2015/disetujui tanggal 11 November 2015 Reverse Transcriptase Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) merupakan teknik yang sangat ampuh untuk mendeteksi jumlah mRNA yang rendah dalam sel tanaman. Pengukuran akumulasi transkrip tersebut relatif terhadap kontrol ekspresi seperti gen-gen housekeeping. Keandalan teknik RT-qPCR bergantung pada pemilihan kontrol internal yang disebut pula gen referensi. Hal tersebut menjadi alasan kenapa validasi gen referensi disarankan untuk setiap set sampel cDNAs yang akan digunakan pada eksperimen RT-qPCR baru. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menganalisis stabilitas sebelas gen-gen housekeeping terpilih pada tiga organ Hevea brasiliensis (daun, kulit batang dan akar) tercekam kekeringan moderat selama 15 hari. RNA total diisolasi dari 18 sampel yang terdiri dari tanaman kontrol dan tercekam kekeringan pada hari ke-0 (D0), ke-5 (D5) dan ke-15 (D15). Kualitas cDNA yang disintesis divalidasi dengan amplifikasi PCR menggunakan primer HbActin. Kesebelas pasangan primer penyandi gen-gen housekeeping pada Hevea (HbActin, HbelF1Aa, HbUBC4, HbUBC2b, HbYLS8, HbRH2b, HbRH8, HbUBC2a, HbαTub, Hb40S dan HbUBI) divalidasi dengan amplifikasi PCR. Nilai Crossing-point (Cp) yang diukur dengan metode derivatif kedua pasca analisis RT-qPCR mengungkapkan nilai rerata Cp yang lebih tinggi secara signifikan untuk kesebelas gen housekeeping pada titik sampling D5 dibanding D0 dan D15. Studi ini menyarankan bahwa metode perhitungan koefisien keragaman (CV) sederhana dapat digunakan untuk menentukan peringkat gen referensi pada tanaman karet berdasarkan ekspresinya yang stabil. Lima gen housekeeping (HbRH2b, HbRH8, HbUBC4, HbαTUB dan HbActin) dapat digunakan sebagai gen referensi untuk analisis RT-qPCR pada Hevea brasiliensis yang tercekam kekeringan moderat. Gen HbRH2b memiliki ekspresi paling stabil dibanding yang lain. Abstrak

 and Pfaffl et al. (2002), a suitable Cp value for transcript abundance analysis should range between 19-23 despite it may change depending on the degree of cDNA dilutions. Housekeeping genes performing generally constitutive expression are measured before 25 th cycle. Cp value in close proximity to the 30 th cycle shows low expression of housekeeping gene unsuitable to be used as a reference gene. HbActin had the highest level of expression with the mean Cp value as high as 18.686 and 19.557 at D0 and D15 sampling points in comparison to 22.171 for HbelF1Aa at D5 sampling point. The lowest level of expression was performed by HbUBI at three sampling points with mean Cp values of 29.383, 31.717 and 27.086 (

and 2.64%, respectively. At the sampling point of 
D5, the top three of reference genes belonged to 
HbRH2b, HbαTUB and HbRH8 with CV values of 
3.67, 4.79 and 5.06%, respectively. At the sampling 
point of D15, HbRH2b was the most stable 
reference gene with a CV value of 1.81% followed 
by HbActin and HbUBC4 ith CV values of 2.11

analysis using CV, HbRH2b gene showed 

consistent and stable expressions in three sampling 
points with CV values ranging from 1.81 to 3.67%.

Tsallis entropy, also known as HCDT entropy  (Havrda and Charvát 1967; Daróczy 1970; Tsallis 1988) , is of particular interest  (Jost 2006; Marcon et al. 2014a)  namely because it gathers the number of species and  Shannon (1948a,b)  and  Simpson (1949)  indices of diversity into a single framework. Interpretation of entropy is not straightforward but one can easily transform it into Hill numbers  (Hill 1973)  which have many desirable properties  (Jost 2007) : mainly, they are the number of equally-frequent species that would give the same level of diversity as the data.  Marcon and Hérault (2015a)  generalized the duality of entropy and diversity, deriving the relation between phylogenetic or functional diversity  (Chao, Chiu, and Jost 2010 ) and phylogenetic or functional entropy (we will write phylodiversity and phyloentropy for short), as introduced by  Pavoine, Love, and Bonsall (2009) . Special cases are the well-known indices PD for phylogenetic diversity  (Faith 1992)  and FD for functional diversity  (Petchey and Gas-ton 2002)  and  Rao's (1982)  quadratic entropy. The same relation holds between Ricotta and Szeidl entropy of a community  (Ricotta and Szeidl 2006)  and similarity-based diversity  (Leinster and Cobbold 2012) . The entropart package  (Marcon and Hérault 2015b)  for R (R Core Team 2015) enables calculation of all these measures of diversity and entropy and their partitioning and is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at http://CRAN.R-project.org/package= entropart. Diversity partitioning means that, in a given area, the γ diversity D γ of all individuals found may be split into within (α diversity, D α ) and between (β diversity, D β ) local assemblages. α diversity reflects the diversity of individuals in local assemblages whereas β diversity reflects the diversity of the local assemblages.  Marcon et al. (2014a)  derived the decomposition of Tsallis γ entropy into its α and β components, generalized to phylodiversity  (Marcon and Hérault 2015a ) and similarity-based diversity  (Marcon, Zhang, and Hérault 2014b) . Estimators of diversity are biased because of unseen species and also because they are not linear functions of probabilities  (Marcon et al. 2014a) . α and γ diversities are underestimated by naive estimators  (Chao and Shen 2003; Dauby and Hardy 2012) . β diversity is severely biased too when sampling is not sufficient  (Beck, Holloway, and Schwanghart 2013) . Biascorrected estimators of phylodiversity have been developed by  Marcon and Hérault (2015a) . Estimators of similarity-based diversity were derived by  Marcon et al. (2014b) . The package includes them all. In summary, the framework supported by the package is as follows. First, an information function is chosen to describe the amount of surprise brought by the observation of each individual. In the simplest case of species-neutral diversity, it is just a decreasing function of probability: Observing an individual of a rarer species brings more surprise. Various information functions allow evaluating species-neutral, phylogenetic or functional entropy. Surprise is averaged among all individuals of a community to obtain its entropy. Entropy is systematically transformed into diversity for interpretation. Diversity is an effective number of species, i.e., the number of equally-different and equally-frequent species that would give the same entropy as the data. The average entropy of communities of an assemblage is α entropy, while the entropy of the assemblage is γ entropy. Their difference is β entropy. After transformation, β diversity is the ratio of γ to α diversity. It is an effective number of communities, i.e., the number of equally-weighted communities with no species in common necessary to obtain the same diversity as the data. correction of estimation bias is more easily applied to entropy before transforming it into diversity. This framework is somehow different from that of  Chao, Chiu, and Jost (2014)  who define α diversity in another way (see  Marcon and Hérault 2015a , for a detailed comparison), such that α entropy is not the average surprise of an assemblage. They also propose a definition of functional diversity ) based on the information brought by pairs of individuals that is not supported in the package. The subsequent sections of this paper present the package features, illustrated by worked examples based on the data included in the package. 
 Package organization 
 Data Most functions of the package calculate entropy or diversity of a community or of an assemblage of communities called a ""meta-community"". Community functions accept a vector of probabilities or of abundances for species data. Each element of the vector contains the probability or the number of occurrences of a species in a given community. Meta-community functions require a particular data organization in a 'MetaCommunity' object described here. A 'MetaCommunity' object is basically a list. Its main components are Nsi, a matrix containing the species abundances whose rows are species, columns are communities and Wi, a vector containing community weights. Creating a 'MetaCommunity' object is the purpose of the MetaCommunity() function. Arguments are a dataframe containing the number of individuals per species (rows) in each community (columns), and a vector containing the community weights. The following example creates a 'MetaCommunity' object consisting of three communities of unequal weights with 4 species. The weighted average probabilities of occurrence of species and the total number of individuals define the meta-community as the assemblage of communities. R> library(""entropart"") R> (df <-data.frame(C1 = c(10, 10, 10, 10), C2 = c(0, 20, 35, 5), + C3 = c(25, 15, 0, 2), row.names = c(""sp1"", ""sp2"", ""sp3"", ""sp4""))) C1 C2 C3 sp1 10 0 25 sp2 10 20 15 sp3 10 35 0 sp4 10 5 2 R> w <-c(1, 2, 1) R> MC <-MetaCommunity(Abundances = df, Weights = w) A meta-community is partitioned into several local communities (indexed by i = 1, 2, . . . , I). n i individuals are sampled in community i. Let s = 1, 2, . . . , S denote the species that compose the meta-community, n s,i the number of individuals of species s sampled in the local community i, n s = i n s,i the total number of individuals of species s, n = s i n s,i the total number of sampled individuals. Within each community i, the probability p s,i for an individual to belong to species s is estimated byp s,i = n s,i /n i . The same probability for the meta-community is p s . Communities have a weight w i , satisfying p s = i w i p s,i . The commonly used w i = n i /n is a possible weight, but the weighting may be arbitrary (e.g., depending on the sampled areas). The component Ps of a 'MetaCommunity' object contains the probability of occurrence of each species in the meta-community, calculated in this way: Paracou618.MC is a meta-community made of two communities named ""P006"" and ""P018"", containing 425 species (their name is Family_Genus_Species, abbreviated to 4 characters). The values of the abundance matrix are the number of individuals of each species in each community. Sample coverage will be explained later. 
 R> MC$Ps The dataset also contains a taxonomy and a functional tree. Paracou618.Taxonomy is an object of class 'phylog', defined in package ade4  (Dray and Dufour 2007) , namely a phylogenetic tree. This example data is only a taxonomy, containing family, genus and species levels for the sake of simplicity. Paracou618.Functional is an object of class 'hclust' containing a functional tree based on leaf, height, stem and seed functional traits  (Hérault and Honnay 2007; Marcon and Hérault 2015a) . The package accepts any ultrametric tree of class 'phylog' or 'hclust'. Paracou618.dist is the distance matrix (actually a 'dist' object) used to build the functional tree. 
 Utilities The deformed logarithm formalism  (Tsallis 1994 ) is very convenient to manipulate entropies. The deformed logarithm of order q is defined as: ln q x = x 1−q − 1 1 − q . (1) It converges to ln when q → 1. The inverse function of ln q x is the deformed exponential: e x q = [1 + (1 − q)x] 1 1−q . (2) The corresponding functions in the package are lnq(x, q) and expq(x, q). 
 Species-neutral diversity 
 Community functions 
 HCDT entropy Species-neutral HCDT entropy of order q of a community is defined as: q H = 1 − s p q s q − 1 = − s p q s ln q p s . (3) q is the order of diversity (e.g., 1 for Shannon). Entropy can be calculated by the Tsallis function. Paracou meta-community entropy of order 1 is: R> Tsallis(Ps = Paracou618.MC$Ps, q = 1) [1] 4.736023 For convenience, special cases of entropy of order q have their own functions with clear names: Richness for q = 0, Shannon for q = 1, Simpson for q = 2. 
 R> Shannon(Ps = Paracou618.MC$Ps) [1] 4.736023 Entropy values have no intuitive interpretation in general, except for the number of species 0 H and Simpson entropy 2 H which is the probability for two randomly chosen individuals to belong to different species. 
 Sample coverage A useful indicator of sampling quality is the sample coverage  (Good 1953; Chao, Lee, and Chen 1988; Zhang and Huang 2007) , that is the probability for a species of the community to be observed in the actual sample. It equals the sum of the probability of occurrences of all observed species. Its historical estimator is  (Good 1953) : C = 1 − S 1 n . (4) S 1 is the number of singletons (species observed once) of the sample, and n is its size. The estimator has been improved by taking into account the whole distribution of species  (Zhang and Huang 2007) . The Coverage function calculates it, allowing to choose the estimator, using Zhang and Huang's method by default: R> Coverage(Ns = Paracou618.MC$Ns) [1] 0.9220438 The sample coverage cannot be estimated from probability data; abundances are required. Its interpretation is straightforward: Some species have not been sampled. Their number is unknown but their total probability of occurrence can be estimated accurately. Here, it is a bit less than 8%. From another point of view, the probability for an individual of the community to belong to a sampled species is C: 8% of them belong to missed species. If the number of missed species are of interest, they can be estimated using other software packages (e.g., the R package SPECIES, Wang 2011), but we will not discuss this in detail here. The sample coverage is the foundation of many estimators of entropy. 
 Bias-corrected estimators Correction of estimation bias is used to improve the estimation of entropy despite unobserved species and also mathematical issues  (Bonachela, Hinrichsen, and Muñoz 2008) . Biascorrected estimators (often relying on sample coverage) are returned by functions whose names are prefixed by bc, such as bcTsallis. They are similar to the non-corrected ones but they use abundance data and propose several bias correction techniques which can be selected by the Correction argument. A ""Best"" correction is calculated by default as detailed in the help file of each function. R> bcTsallis(Ns = Paracou618.MC$Ns, q = 1) [1] 4.898061 The best correction for Tsallis entropy follows  Marcon et al. (2014a) . bcSimpson returns Lande's correction  (Lande 1996)  and bcShannon returns the very efficient correction by  Chao, Wang, and Jost (2013) , so that their results are different (and more accurate) than those of the general bcTsallis function. 
 R> bcShannon(Ns = Paracou618.MC$Ns) [1] 4.892159 Bias-corrected entropy is ready to be transformed into explicit diversity. 
 Effective numbers of species Entropy should be converted into ""true diversity""  (Jost 2007) , i.e., effective number of species equal to  Hill (1973)  numbers: q D = s p q s 1 1−q . (5) This can be done by the deformed exponential function, or using directly the Diversity or bcDiversity functions (equal to the deformed exponential of order q of Tsallis or bcTsallis) R> expq(Simpson(Ps = Paracou618.MC$Ps), q = 2) [1] 68.7215 R> Diversity(Ps = Paracou618.MC$Ps, q = 2) [1] 68.7215 R> expq(bcTsallis(Ns = Paracou618.MC$Ns, q = 2), q = 2) [1] 73.19676 R> bcDiversity(Ns = Paracou618.MC$Ns, q = 2) [1] 73.19676 The effective number of species of the Paracou dataset is estimated to be 73 after bias correction (rather than 69 without it). It means that a community made of 73 equally-frequent species has the same Simpson entropy as the actual one. This is much less than the actual 425 sampled species but Simpson's entropy focuses on dominant species. 
 Meta-community functions Meta-community functions allow partitioning diversity according to Patil and Taillie's concept of diversity of a mixture  (Patil and Taillie 1982) , i.e., α entropy of a meta-community is defined as the weighted average of community entropy, following  Routledge (1979) : q H α = i w i q i H α . (6) q i H α is the entropy of community i: q i H α = 1 − s p q s,i q − 1 = − s p q s,i ln q p s,i . (7) Jost's (2007) definition of α entropy is not supported explicitly in the package since it only allows partitioning of equally weighted communities. In this particular case, both definitions are identical. γ entropy of the meta-community is defined as α entropy of a community. β entropy, the difference between γ and α, is the generalized Jensen-Shannon divergence between the species distribution of the meta-community and those of communities  (Marcon et al. 2014a) : q H β = q H γ − q H α = s p q s,i ln q p s,i p s . (8) β entropy should be transformed into diversity, i.e., an effective number of communities: q D β = e q H β 1−(q−1) q Hα q . (9) 
 Basic meta-community functions These values can be estimated by the meta-community functions named AlphaEntropy, AlphaDiversity, BetaEntropy, BetaDiversity. They accept a 'MetaCommunity' object and an order of diversity q as arguments, and return an 'MCentropy' or 'MCdiversity' object which can be summarized and plotted. GammaEntropy and GammaDiversity return a number. Corrections of estimation bias are applied by default: R> e <-AlphaEntropy(Paracou618.MC, q = 1) R> summary(e) The Shannon α entropy of the meta-community is 4.52. It is the weighted average entropy of communities. 
 Diversity partition of a meta-community The DivPart function calculates everything at once. Its arguments are the same, but bias correction is not applied by default. It can be, using the argument Biased = FALSE, and the correction is chosen by the argument Correction. It returns a 'DivPart' object which can be summarized (entropy is not printed by summary) and plotted: The long rectangle of height 1 represents γ diversity, equal to 134 effective species. The narrower and higher rectangle has the same area: its horizontal size is α diversity (92 effective species) and its height is β diversity (1.46 effective communities). The α diversity of communities is 92 effective species, which is the exponential of the entropy calculated previously. This is more than Simpson diversity (73 species, calculated above), because less frequent species are taken into account. γ diversity of the meta-community is 134 effective species. β diversity is 1.46 effective communities, i.e., the two actual communities are as different from each other as 1.46 ones with equal weights and no species in common. 
 R> p <-DivPart 
 Diversity estimation of a meta-community The DivEst function decomposes diversity and estimates confidence intervals of α, β and γ diversity following  Marcon et al. (2012) . If the observed species frequencies of a community are assumed to be a realization of a multinomial distribution, they can be drawn again to obtain a distribution of entropy. R> de <-DivEst(q = 1, Paracou618.MC, Biased = FALSE, Correction = ""Best"", + Simulations = 1000) ====================================================================== R> summary(de) The result is a 'Divest' object which can be summarized and plotted  (Figure 3 ). The uncertainty of estimation is due to sampling: The distribution of the estimators corresponds to the simulated repetitions of sampling from the original multinomial distribution of species. It ignores the remaining bias of the estimator, which is unknown. Yet, except for q = 2, the corrected estimators are biased (even though much less than the non-corrected ones), especially when q is small. New estimators to reduce the bias are included in the package regularly. 
 Diversity profile of a meta-community DivProfile calculates diversity profiles, i.e., the value of diversity against its order  (Figure 4) . The result is a 'DivProfile' object which can be summarized and plotted.  R> dp <-DivProfile(seq(0, 2, 0.2), Paracou618.MC, Biased = FALSE) R> summary(dp)  Small orders of diversity give more weight to rare species. P018 can be considered more diverse than P006 because their profiles  (Figure 4 , top right) do not cross  (Tothmeresz 1995) : Its diversity is systematically higher. The shape of the β diversity profile shows that the communities are more diverse when their dominant species are considered. 
 Alternative functions β entropy can also be calculated by a set of functions named after the community functions, such as TsallisBeta, bcTsallisBeta, SimpsonBeta, etc., which require two vectors of abundances or probabilities instead of a 'MetaCommunity' object: that of the community and the expected one (usually that of the meta-community). Bias correction is currently limited to Chao and Shen's correction. The example below calculates the Shannon β entropy of the first community of Paracou618 and the meta-community. These functions are available to be particularly used, when a 'MetaCommunity' object is not available or not convenient to use (e.g., simulations). Meta-community functions are preferred in general. 
 Phylogenetic diversity Phylogenetic or functional diversity generalizes HCDT diversity, considering the distance between species  (Marcon and Hérault 2015a) . Here, all species take place in an ultrametric phylogenetic or functional tree (  Figure 5 ). The tree is cut into slices, delimited by two nodes. The first slice starts at the bottom of the tree and ends at the first node. In slice k, L k leaves are found. The probabilities of occurrence of the species belonging to branches that were below leaf l in the original tree are summed to give the grouped probability u k,l . HCDT entropy can be calculated in slice k: q k H = − l u q k,l ln q u k,l . (10) Then, it is summed over the tree slices. Phyloentropy can be normalized or not. We normalize it so that it does not depend on the tree height: q H (T ) = K k=1 T k T q k H. (11) Unnormalized values are multiplied by the tree height, such as q PD(T )  (Chao et al. 2010) . Phyloentropy is calculated as HCDT entropy along the slices of the trees applying possible corrections of estimation bias, summed, possibly normalized, and finally transformed into diversity: q D (T ) = e q H(T ) q . (12) 
 Community functions PhyloEntropy and the estimation bias corrected bcPhyloEntropy are the phylogenetic analogs of Tsallis and bcTsallis. They accept the same arguments plus an ultrametric tree of class 'hclust' or 'phylog', and Normalize, a Boolean to normalize the tree height to 1 (by default). Phylogenetic diversity is calculated by PhyloDiversity or bcPhyloDiversity, analogous to the species-neutral diversity functions Diversity and bcDiversity. Results are either a 'PhyloDiversity' or a 'PhyloEntropy' object, which can be plotted (  Figure 6 ) and summarized. R> phd <-bcPhyloDiversity(Paracou618.MC$Ns, q = 1, + Tree = Paracou618.Taxonomy, Normalize = TRUE) R> summary(phd) alpha or gamma phylogenetic or functional diversity of order 1 of distribution Paracou618.MC$Ns with correction: Best Phylogenetic or functional diversity was calculated according to the tree Paracou618.Taxonomy Diversity is normalized Diversity equals: 55.13383 The phylogenetic diversity of order 1 of the Paracou dataset is 55 effective species: 55 totally different species (only connected by the root of the tree) with equal probabilities would have the same entropy. It can be compared to its species-neutral diversity, 134 species. The latter is the diversity of the first slice of the tree. When going up the tree, diversity decreases because species collapse. On  Figure 6 , diversity of the second slice, between T = 1 and T = 2, is that of genera (64 effective genera) and the last slice contains (20 effective families). The phylogenetic entropy of the community is the average of the entropy along slices, weighted by the slice lengths. Diversity cannot be averaged in the same way. A less trivial phylogeny would contain many slices, resulting in as many diversity levels with respect to T . The AllenH function is similar to PhyloEntropy: It also calculates phyloentropy but the algorithm is that of  Allen, Kon, and Bar-Yam (2009)  for q = 1 and that of  Leinster and Cobbold (2012)  for q = 1. It is much faster since it does not require calculating entropy for each slice of the tree but it does not allow correction of estimation bias. ChaoPD calculates phylodiversity according to  Chao et al. (2010) , with the same advantages and limits compared to PhyloDiversity. The effective number of taxa of Shannon diversity is plotted against the distance from the leaves of the phylogenetic tree. Here, the tree is based on a rough taxonomy, so diversity of species, genera and families are the three levels of the curve. The dotted line represents the value of phylodiversity. For convenience, functions PDFD and Rao are provided to calculate unnormalized phyloentropy of order 0 and 2. 
 Meta-community functions Functions DivPart, DivEst and DivProfile return phylogenetic entropy and diversity values instead of species-neutral ones if a tree is provided in the arguments. R> dp <-DivPart(q = 1, Paracou618.MC, Biased = FALSE, Correction = ""Best"", + Tree = Paracou618.Taxonomy) R> summary(dp) The decomposition is interpreted as the species-neutral one: γ diversity is 55 effective species, made of 1.3 effective communities of 43 effective species. Other meta-community functions, such as AlphaEntropy behave in the same way: R> summary(BetaEntropy(Paracou618.MC, q = 2, Tree = Paracou618.Taxonomy, + Correction = ""None"", Normalize = FALSE)) HCDT beta entropy of order 2 of metaCommunity Paracou618.MC with correction: None   Leinster and Cobbold (2012)  introduced similarity-based diversity of a community q D Z . A matrix Z describes the similarity between pairs of species, defined between 0 and 1. A species' ordinariness is its average similarity with all species (weighted by species frequencies), including similarity with itself (equal to 1). Similarity-based diversity is the reciprocal of the generalized average of order q  (Hardy, Littlewood, and Pólya 1952)  of the community species' ordinariness. 
 Similarity-based diversity The Dqz function calculates similarity-based diversity. Its arguments are the vector of probabilities of occurrences of the species, the order of diversity and the similarity matrix Z. The bcDqz function allows correction of estimation bias. This example calculates the γ diversity of the meta-community Paracou. First, the similarity matrix is calculated from the distance matrix between all pairs of species as 1 minus normalized dissimilarity. R> DistanceMatrix <-as.matrix(Paracou618.dist) R> Z <-1 -DistanceMatrix/max(DistanceMatrix) R> bcDqz(Paracou618.MC$Ns, q = 2, Z) [1] 1.483027 If Z is the identity matrix, similarity-based diversity equals HCDT diversity: R> Dqz(Paracou618.MC$Ps, q = 2, Z = diag(length(Paracou618.MC$Ps))) [1] 68.7215 R> Diversity(Paracou618.MC$Ps, q = 2) [1] 68.7215 Functional diversity of order 2 is only 1.48 effective species, which is very small compared to 69 effective species for Simpson diversity. 1.48 equally-frequent species with similarity equal to 0 would have the same functional diversity as the actual community (made of 425 species). This means that species are very similar from a functional point of view. The very low values returned by q D Z are questioned by  Chao et al. (2014)  and discussed in depth by  Marcon et al. (2014b) : The choice of the similarity matrix is not trivial. The similarity-based entropy of a community q H Z  (Leinster and Cobbold 2012; Ricotta and Szeidl 2006)  has the same relations with diversity as HCDT entropy and Hill numbers. The Hqz function calculates it: R> Hqz(Paracou618.MC$Ps, q = 2, Z) [1] 0.3208152 R> lnq(Dqz(Paracou618.MC$Ps, q = 2, Z), q = 2) [1] 0.3208152 As species-neutral entropy, q H Z has no straightforward interpretation beyond the average surprise of a community. All meta-community functions can be used to estimate similarity-based diversity. Argument Z must be provided: The α functional entropy of the meta-community is the average entropy of communities. 
 Advanced tools The package comes with a set of tools to realize frequents tasks: run Monte Carlo simulations on a community, quickly calculate its diversity profile, apply a function to a species distribution along a tree, and manipulate meta-communities. 
 Entropy of Monte Carlo simulated communities The EntropyCI function is a versatile tool to simplify simulations. Simulated communities are obtained by random draws from a multinomial distribution of species and their entropy is calculated. The arguments of EntropyCI are an entropy function (any entropy function of the package accepting a vector of species abundances, such as bcTsallis), the number of simulations to run and the observed species frequencies. The result is a numeric vector containing the entropy value of each simulated community. Entropy can be finally transformed into diversity (but it is not correct to use a diversity function in simulations because the average simulated value must be calculated and only entropy can be averaged). This example shows how to use the function. First, the distribution of the γ HCDT entropy of order 1 (Shannon entropy) of the Paracou meta-community is calculated and transformed into diversity. Then, the actual diversity is calculated and completed by the 95% confidence interval of the simulated values. These results are identical to those of the DivEst function but a single community can be addressed (DivEst requires a 'MetaCommunity' object). 
 Diversity or entropy profile of a community This function is used to calculate diversity or entropy profiles based on community functions such as Tsallis or ChaoPD. It is similar to DivProfile but does not require a 'MetaCommunity' as argument. It returns a list which can be plotted. This example evaluates bias correction on the diversity profile of the Paracou dataset. First, diversity profiles are calculated with and without bias correction: R> bcProfile <-CommunityProfile(bcDiversity, Paracou618.MC$Ns) R> Profile <-CommunityProfile(Diversity, Paracou618.MC$Ps) Then, they can be plotted together  (Figure 7 ): R> plot(bcProfile, type = ""l"", main = """", xlab = ""q"", ylab = ""Diversity"") R> lines(y~x, data = Profile, lty = 3) R> legend(""topright"", c(""Bias Corrected"", ""Biased""), lty = c(1, 3), + inset = 0.02) 
 Applying a function over a phylogenetic tree The PhyloApply function is used to apply an entropy community function (generally bcTsallis) along a tree, the same way lapply works with a list. This example shows how to calculate Shannon entropy along the tree containing the taxonomy to obtain species, genus and family entropy shown in  Figure 6 :  R> 
 Manipulation of meta-communities Several meta-communities, combined in a list, can be merged in two different ways. The MergeMC function simplifies hierarchical partitioning of diversity: It considers the aggregated data of each meta-community as a community and builds an upper-level meta-community with them. The α entropy of the new meta-community is the weighted average γ entropy of the original meta-communities. MergeC combines the communities of several meta-communities to create a single metacommunity containing them all. Finally, ShuffleMC randomly shuffles communities across meta-communities to allow simulations to test differences between meta-communities. This example shows how to do this. First, one meta-community is created, with weights of communities proportional to their number of individuals: R> (df <-data.frame(C1 = c(10, 10, 10, 10), C2 = c(0, 20, 35, 5), + C3 = c(25, 15, 0, 2), row.names = c(""sp1"", ""sp2"", ""sp3"", ""sp4""))) C1 C2 C3 sp1 10 0 25 sp2 10 20 15 sp3 10 35 0 sp4 10 5 2 R> w <-colSums(df) R> MC1 <-MetaCommunity(Abundances = df, Weights = w) Then a second one: R> (df <-data.frame(C1 = c(10, 4), C2 = c(3, 4), row.names = c(""sp1"", + ""sp5""))) C1 C2 sp1 10 3 sp5 4 4 R> w <-colSums(df) R> MC2 <-MetaCommunity(Abundances = df, Weights = w) They can be merged to obtain a single meta-community containing all original communities: Hierarchical diversity partitioning can then be achieved: R> dpAll <-DivPart(q = 1, MC = mergedMC2) R> summary(dpAll) HCDT diversity partitioning of order 1 of metaCommunity mergedMC2 The γ diversity of the top assemblage (MC1 and MC2) is 4.28 effective species, made of 1.24 effective meta-communities of 3.46 effective species. The α diversity of each meta-community of the top assemblage is their γ diversity when it is partitioned in turn: R> dpMC1 <-DivPart(q = 1, MC = MC1) R> summary(dpMC1) HCDT diversity partitioning of order 1 of metaCommunity MC1 The γ diversity of MC1 is 3.77 effective species, made of 1.38 effective meta-communities of 2.74 effective species. The same decomposition can be done for MC2. 
 Conclusion The entropart package allows estimating biodiversity according to the framework based on HCDT entropy, the correction of its estimation bias  (Grassberger 1988; Chao and Shen 2003)  and its transformation into equivalent numbers of species  (Hill 1973; Jost 2006; Marcon et al. 2014a) . Phylogenetic or functional diversity  (Marcon and Hérault 2015a)  can be estimated, considering phyloentropy as the average species-neutral diversity over slices of a phylogenetic or functional tree  (Pavoine et al. 2009 ). Similarity-based diversity  (Leinster and Cobbold 2012)  can be used to estimate  (Marcon et al. 2014b ) functional diversity from a similarity or dissimilarity matrix between species without requiring building a dendrogram and thus preserving the topology of species  (Pavoine, Ollier, and Dufour 2005; Podani and Schmera 2007) . The classical diversity estimators (Shannon and Simpson entropy) can be found in many R packages. Package vegetarian (Charney and Record 2012) allows calculating Hill numbers and partitioning them according to Jost's framework. Bias correction is never available except in the package EntropyEstimation  (Cao and Grabchak 2015) , which provides the Zhang and Grabchak's estimators of entropy and diversity and their asymptotic variances (not included in package entropart). Phylodiversity and similarity-based diversity are not available in any package as far as we know. So we believe entropart is a useful toolbox for ecologists who need to estimate the diversity of actual, undersampled communities and to partition it. Figure 1 : 1 Plot of a 'MetaCommunity' object. Communities (named C1, C2 ad C3) are represented in the left part of the figure, the meta-community to the right. Bar widths are proportional to community weights. Species abundances are represented vertically: 4 species are present in the meta-community, only 3 of them in communities C2 and C3.A 'MetaCommunity' object can be summarized and plotted(Figure 1).

Lakes and rivers are active systems where the transport, transformation and storage of organic carbon (OC) affect the carbon cycle on a landscape and global scale (e.g.,  Cole et al., 2007; Tranvik et al., 2009; Raymond et al., 2013) . In this context, the wetlands are dynamic interfaces between the terrestrial and aquatic realms, which promote the redistribution of carbon sources and sinks. Thus, they must be taken into account for the carbon fluxes and storage in the continents and for climate change mitigation strategies  (Battin et al., 2009) . Floodplain lakes are temporary or permanent water bodies formed in the wetlands of the Amazon basin. They are among R. L. Sobrinho et al.: Spatial and seasonal contrasts of sedimentary organic matter formed by the flooded forests, macrophytes, phytoplankton, and periphyton  (Junk et al., 2010) . Inputs of CO 2 from plant respiration and reactive OC produced in floodplain lakes are significant sources of CO 2 outgassed in the central Amazon basin  (Abril et al., 2014) . The periodic floods intensify the exchange of organic compounds, nutrients and minerals between rivers, lakes and flooded soils  (Junk, 1997) . Although only 10-20 % of the organic matter (OM) produced in the water column reaches the sediment and is finally buried  (Devol et al., 1984) , the sediments in these lakes are important sinks of carbon . Most of the sedimentary organic matter (SOM) in freshwater systems is derived from terrestrial vascular plants  (Goñi and Hedges, 1992 ;  Moreira-Turcq et al., 2004; Mortillaro et al., 2011) . In the Amazon basin, many studies have characterized the suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM) in the rivers and the floodplain lakes and concluded that the main sources of OM to the aquatic system are the forests and the upstream Andean soils (e.g.,  Hedges et al., 1986 Hedges et al., , 1994 Quay et al., 1992; Victoria et al., 1992; Moreira-Turcq et al., 2004 Aufdenkampe et al., 2007; Mortillaro et al., 2011; Zell et al., 2013b) . However, little is known about the molecular composition of the SOM in the floodplain lakes in general, and in particular, the contribution of the multiple sources of OM (upland soils, flooded and non-flooded forests, aquatic macrophytes, and phytoplankton) remains uncertain  (Mortillaro et al., 2011; Zocatelli et al., 2011; Moreira et al., 2014) . The seasonality and the spatiality of the wetlands in the Amazon basin strongly influence the dynamics and the quality of OM in the surface sediments of floodplain lakes. Most of the SOM is supposed to be transported to the floodplain lakes via Amazon River main stem during the rising and high water seasons  Victoria et al., 1992; Moreira-Turcq et al., 2004 Mortillaro et al., 2011) . However, a significant increase in the vertical flux of OM was observed in Lake Curuai during the falling water season, which is interpreted as the result of resuspended sediments when the lake becomes smaller and shallower . In terms of the spatiality, the downstream lakes present higher values of δ 13 C org in comparison to the upstream lakes  (Victoria et al., 1992) . This variability may be explained by the differences in the interfaces between the rivers and the lakes along the upstream-downstream transect or in aquatic primary production (mainly aquatic plants), which is more widespread in the open water lakes downstream. A previous study of bulk parameters and fatty acids in the central Amazon basin  (Mortillaro et al., 2011)  was not conclusive about the sources of SOM in floodplain lakes. Hence, the present work applies multiple biomarkers, namely lignin phenols, branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) and crenarchaeol (isoprenoid GDGT), in addition to the bulk parameters, to disentangle the sources of SOM in floodplain lakes of the central Amazon basin and the role of the spatiality and seasonality in determining the composition of the SOM. Lignin is produced by vascular plants. It is composed of phenolic compounds and is generally considered as a recalcitrant organic molecule. As a consequence, the products of CuO degradation of lignin  (Hedges and Ertel, 1982)  have been widely applied as biomarkers to trace plant material to aquatic systems  Bernardes et al., 2004; Aufdenkampe et al., 2007; Kuzyk et al., 2008) . Previous works in the Amazon basin showed that lignin is an important component of fossil OC in floodplain lakes  (Zocatelli et al., 2013)  but also a relevant carbon source for the outgassing of CO 2 in the Amazon River  (Ward et al., 2013) . This apparent contradiction reflects the relevance of environmental conditions on the degradation of organic molecules  (Schmidt et al., 2012)  which must be considered in the application of these biomarkers. The GDGTs are membrane lipids mainly composed of acyclic or cyclic biphytane core lipids with two glycerol head groups  (Hopmans et al., 2000) . The head groups are easily degraded while the two biphytanyl core lipids are well preserved in sediments and soils  (White et al., 1979; Harvey et al., 1986) . The GDGTs are found in diverse environments worldwide but the brGDGTs are mainly produced in the soil (by the bacteria domaine.g.,  Weijers et al., 2006) , and the crenarchaeol is predominant in the aquatic environments and produced by Thaumarchaeota  (Sinninghe Damsté et al., 2002) . Accordingly, the relative amount of brGDGTs to the crenarchaeol, the so-called Branched and Isoprenoid Tetraether (BIT) index, have been proposed to quantify the OC proportion originating from soils and aquatic environments (e.g.,  Hopmans et al., 2004; Herfort et al., 2006; Belicka and Harvey, 2009; Smith et al., 2010) . Previously, this method was successfully applied in rivers and floodplain lakes of the Amazon basin (e.g.,  Kim et al., 2012; Zell et al., 2013a; Moreira et al., 2014) . A comparison between lignin phenols and GDGTs as markers for terrestrial OC has been performed in marine and lacustrine systems (e.g.,  Smith et al., 2010) . This comparison showed complementary information on the transport and sedimentation of terrestrial OC in aquatic systems. Finally, the combination of these two groups of biomarkers with the bulk parameters, analyzed in superficial sediments collected in five floodplain lakes of the central Amazon basin in four hydrological seasons, provides new insights into the link between the hydrology of the Amazon basin to the sources of SOM in floodplain lakes. 
 Study area The Amazon River is the world's largest river with a drainage basin area of 6.1 × 10 6 km 2 covering about 40 % of South America  (Goulding et al., 2003) . The mean annual discharge is 200 × 10 3 m 3 s −1 at Óbidos, the most downstream gauging station on the Amazon River  (Callede et al., 2010) . Rivers within the Amazon drainage basin are traditionally classified   Figure 1  (a)  according to water color, as well as physical and chemical parameters  (Sioli, 1950) : white water (e.g., Solimões, Madeira and Amazon rivers), black water (e.g., Negro River), and clear water (e.g., Tapajós River). The total area of wetland is 350 × 10 3 km 2  (Melack and Hess, 2011) . 17 % of the central Amazon basin is subjected to periodic floods. This creates large temporary wetlands -i.e., seasonally flooded forests, woodlands, and shrubs -corresponding to 58 % of the total flooded area during the high water season. Aquatic macrophytes, floating meadow and marsh cover 5 to 8 % of the wetlands, and open waters correspond to 12 and 14 % in low and high water seasons, respectively  (Hess et al., 2003) . Five floodplain lakes were investigated in this study: Cabaliana, Janauaca, Mirituba, Canaçari and Curuai  (Fig. 1a ,  Table 1 ). The lakes are located along the Solimões-Amazon River shoreline in a biogeographic gradient of upstream flooded forests to downstream flooded woodlands and open water lakes  (Bourgoin et al., 2007; Abril et al., 2014) . Cabaliana is a round-shaped lake surrounded by flooded forests and two sub-regions  (Fig. 1b) . In the northern region, the Manacapuru River discharges black water while in the southern region, the white water brought by the Solimões River, mixes with black water. Janauaca has a peculiar morphology with a ravine shape surrounded by flooded forests  (Fig. 1b) . Solimões water comes through the channel in the north, and some clear water comes through the stream system in the south. Conductivity values in lakes Cabalina and Janauaca are close to that of the Solimões River, evidencing that white waters predominate. Mirituba has a round shape and receives white water from the Madeira River and the Amazon River through a complex drainage system  (Fig. 1c) . It is a white water lake surrounded by flooded forests and woodlands, with no significant contribution of black water streams. Canaçari has two well-defined sub-regions  (Fig. 1c) . In the northern region, the Urubu River discharges black water and in the southern region, the Amazon River discharges white water. It is surrounded by flooded forests and woodlands and the conductivity is close to that of the white waters of the Amazon River. Curuai is the largest lake in the central Amazon basin, mainly surrounded by woodlands and open waters  (Fig. 1d ). It receives in majority white water from the Amazon River through channels connected to the main stem. Small contributions of black water streams occur in the Curuai floodplain, but remain spatially restricted to their most Southeastern region. (a) (b) (c) (d) (b) (c) (d) 
 Materials and methods 
 Sample collection Surface (0-2 cm) sediment samples (n = 57) were collected using a grab sampler of 100 cm 3 in lakes Cabaliana, Janauaca, Mirituba, Canaçari and Curuai in the central Amazon basin between Manaus and Santarém  (Fig. 1) . The four hydrological seasons were targeted during different research cruises with a small vessel (  Fig. 2) : in June and July 2009, which covered the high water (HW) season; in October 2009 the low water (LW) season, in August 2010 the falling water (FW) season and in January 2011 the rising water (RW) season. In each floodplain lake, sediment samples were collected at three stations in each season. However, sometimes only two samples were collected when stations were not accessible during a specific season. Thus, approximately 12 samples in each lake and 15 samples per season were obtained. The samples were collected in the three most distinct sites of each lake: near the connecting channel, in the middle of the lake and near the flooded forests. Most of the sampling sites were located in areas flooded by the Solimões-Amazon River water (white water). In Cabaliana and Canaçari one station was located near the black water streams in order to represent the heterogeneity of the lakes. Four wetland soils and three nonfloodable soils from well above the maximum inundations levels, known as ""terra firme"", were also collected during the LW season. In addition, four samples of C 3 (Eichornia sp., Pistia stratiotes) and C 4 (Paspalum repens) aquatic plants (macrophytes) were sampled during the HW season in the lakes Janauaca and Curuai. All samples were kept frozen (−20 • C) on the ship and transported frozen to the Universidade Federal Fluminense laboratory (Brazil), where they were freeze-dried. 
 Bulk geochemical parameters For the samples collected during the HW and LW seasons, total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN) and δ 13 C of TC were determined at the Davis Stable Isotope Facility (Department of Plant Sciences, University of California at Davis, California, USA) using a Europe Hydra 20-20 mass spectrometer equipped with a continuous flow isotope ratio monitoring device. Other samples gathered during the FW and RW cruises were analyzed for TC, TN, and δ 13 C of TC using a Flash 2000 organic elemental analyzer interfaced with a Delta V advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer at the J a n . 2 0 0 9 M a y . 2 0 0 9 S e p . 2 0 0 9 J a n . 2 0 1 0 M a y . 2 0 1 0 S e p . 2 0 1 0 J a n .  Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ, the Netherlands). The average precision was ±0.1 mg C g −1 for TC and ±0.05 mg N g −1 for TN. In addition, 16 decarbonated sediment samples were analyzed for the total organic carbon (TOC) contents at NIOZ and at Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF) using a Carlos Erba elemental analyzer EA 1110. These analyses were determined in duplicate with a precision of 0.1 mg C g −1 . TC (wt. %) correlated very well with TOC (wt. %) with an intercept not significantly different from 0 (R 2 = 0.96, p < 0.001, n = 16). This indicates that TC in the floodplain lakes' sediments investigated was predominantly TOC and the fraction of carbonates was minor. Therefore, TC was considered as TOC in this study. In order to assess the contribution of inorganic nitrogen (NH +4 + NO −2 + NO −3 ) to TN, TN (wt. %) and TOC (wt. %) were correlated (R 2 = 0.89; p < 0.001; n = 16). The interception of the correlation line on the TN axis (0.06) was interpreted as the percentage of inorganic nitrogen, suggesting that a contribution of mineral nitrogen present in finegrained sediments accounted for ca. 0.06 wt. %. We thus subtracted 0.06 wt. % from the TN content and used this for the calculation of the C : N ratio. The δ 13 C values of TC are also considered as δ 13 C of TOC (δ 13 C org ) in this study and reported in the standard delta notation relative to Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB) standard. The analytical precision (as the standard deviation for repeated measurements of the internal standards) was ±0.06 ‰ for δ 13 C org . 
 Lignin phenol analysis The lignin phenols were extracted from approximately 500 mg lake sediment and soil samples and from 50 mg of macrophyte samples. The samples were freeze-dried and the extraction method applied was the alkaline CuO oxidation  (Hedges and Ertel, 1982; Goni and Hedges, 1992)  at the Universidade Federal Fluminense laboratory (Brazil). In brief, sediments or macrophytes were transferred to stainless steel reaction vials and digested with 300 mg CuO in 2N NaOH under N 2 in an oxygen-free atmosphere at 150 • C for 150 min. The samples were acidified to pH 1-3 and subsequently 6 mL of ethyl acetate was added. After centrifuging at 2500 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was collected, dried over sodium sulfate (Na 2 SO 4 ), evaporated under a stream of N 2 , reconstituted in pyridine, and converted to trimethylsilyl derivatives using bis-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) at 60 • C for 20 min. Oxidation products were analyzed using an HP Agilent 6890N Series gas chromatography (e.g.,  Zocatelli et al., 2013) . The recovery factor was calculated using the internal standard ethyl vanillin added after the CuO oxidation and prior to analysis (values above 60 % were considered). The response factor was performed using a mixture of commercial standards in four different concentrations, which were periodically injected for calibration. To confirm the identification of each lignin phenol, eight selected samples were analyzed with an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph (GC-FID) coupled to an Agilent 5975C VL MSD mass spectrometer using a selective ion monitoring (SIM) at NIOZ (the Netherlands). Phenol concentrations were reported as the carbonnormalized sum of eight lignin-derived reaction products (λ8 mg g −1 oc ), including vanillyl (V -series) phenols (vanillin, acetovanillone, and vanillic acid), syringyl (S-series) phenols (syringaldehyde, acetosyringone and syringic acid), and cinnamyl (C-series) phenols (p-coumaric and ferulic acid). Ratios S : V and C : V were calculated to identify angiosperm tissue sources. The ratio of acidic to aldehyde vanillyl phenols ((Ad : Al)v) was used as an indicator of the lignin degradation state since acidic phenols are produced from aldehyde functional groups during the lignin degradation  (Hedges and Ertel, 1982) . 
 GDGT analysis All samples for the lipid analysis were processed at NIOZ (the Netherlands). The freeze-dried samples were extracted with a modified Bligh and Dyer technique  (Bligh and Dyer, 1959; Pitcher et al., 2009) . In brief, the samples were extracted three times with a mixture of methanol (MeOH) : dichloromethane (DCM) : phosphate buffer (8.7 g of K 2 HPO 4 in 1 L bidistilled water) 10 : 5 : 4 (v : v : v) in an ultrasonic bath (10 min). Extracts and residues were separated each time by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 2 min. DCM and phosphate buffer were added to the extracts to give a new volume ratio 1 : 1 : 0.9 (v : v : v). This mixture was centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 2 min to obtain a good phase separation. The DCM phase was then collected in a roundbottomed flask. The MeOH-phosphate phase was washed twice with DCM and then discarded. The collected DCM fractions were reduced under rotary vacuum. The Bligh and Dyer extracts were fractioned into core lipids and intact polar lipids (IPLs). The separation was carried out on activated silica with n-hexane : ethylacetate 1 : 1 (v : v) for core lipids and MeOH for IPLs  (Pitcher et al., 2009) . To each fraction, 0.1 µg C 46 GDGT internal standard was added  (Huguet et al., 2006) . Two-thirds of the IPL fraction was hydrolyzed to cleave off polar head groups. The hydrolysis was carried out by refluxing (3 h) in 2 N HCl : MeOH 1 : 1 (v : v). The solution was adjusted to pH 5 with 2 N KOH-MeOH. This mixture was washed three times with DCM. The DCM fractions were collected, reduced by rotary evaporation, and dried over a Na 2 SO 4 column. Core lipids fractions were separated into polar (DCM : MeOH 1 : 1, v : v) and apolar (DCM) fraction over an activated Al 2 O 3 column. The core lipids and IPL GDGTs were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatograph-atmospheric pressure positive ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-APCI-MS, an Agilent 1100 series LC/MSD SL, Alltech Prevail Cyano column, 150 × 2.1 mm × 3 µm) in a selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode according to  Schouten et al. (2007) . Quantification of the GDGTs was achieved by integrating the peak areas and using a C 46 GDGT internal standard according to  Huguet et al. (2006) . 
 Long-chain n-alkanes carbon isotopes Two sediment samples collected in the LW season, one from Lake Janauaca and another from Lake Curuai, were used to compare the differences in the δ 13 C values of plantwax-derived long-chain n-alkanes in the upstream and in the downstream lakes. The extraction of n-alkanes was performed with an accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) method. The extracts were fractionated in apolar and polar fractions using an activated aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3 ) column with hexane and MeOH : DCM (1 : 1, v : v), respectively, as the eluents. n-alkanes in the apolar fractions were identified by a Thermo Finnigan Trace DSQ gas chromatograph mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and quantified with an HP 6890 GC system. To quantify the concentration of the n-alkanes, an internal standard was added to the apolar extracts. To further clean up the apolar fraction, the extracts were passed over a silver nitrate (AgNO 3 ) column using hexane as the eluent. The δ 13 C values of higher n-alkanes were determined using an isotope-ratio-monitoring mass spectrometer (IRM-GC-MS) Thermo Delta V Advantage and the results were obtained using the software Isodat 3.0. Isotope values were measured against calibrated external reference gas and performance of the instrument was monitored by daily injects of a mixture of a C 20 and a C 24 perdeuterated n-alkane with known isotopic compositions. The δ 13 C values for the n-alkanes are reported in the standard delta notation against the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB) standard.

 Statistical analysis To evaluate the differences in mean values between different groups, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was used, which does not meet the normality assumption of the oneway analysis variance (ANOVA). Groups that showed significant differences (p < 0.05) were assigned with different letters. The statistical test was performed with the software package SIGMAPLOT 13.0. 
 Results 
 Bulk parameters The TOC content was the lowest in the downstream Lake Curuai (2.0 ± 0.6 wt. %) and the highest in Lake Cabaliana (3.3 ± 0.8 wt. %)  (Fig. 3a, Table 3 ). No significant seasonal variation was observed (p = 0.145)  (Fig. 4a ). The C : N ratio did not reveal significant spatial (p = 0.104) or seasonal (p = 0.418) variations  (Figs. 3b and 4b) . The δ 13 C org values were significantly less negative in the downstream lakes (p < 0.001)  (Fig. 3c) . In Lake Curuai the mean value was −27 ± 1 ‰ and in Lake Cabaliana −33 ± 2 ‰ . No significant (p = 0.968) seasonal variation was observed for the δ 13 C org values  (Fig. 4c) .    Table 3 .

These samples were collected in the Amazon River margin between Canaçari and Curuai. The C : N ratio values varied between 6 and 16 (n = 7) (  Table 3 ). The C 4 macrophytes samples (Paspalum repens) showed values of δ 13 C org between −14 and −13 ‰ and values of the C : N ratio between 15 and 27. The C 3 macrophytes (Eleocharis sp. and Pistia stratiotes) had δ 13 C org values between −30 and −33 ‰ and C : N ratios between 15 and 24  (Table 2) . 
 Lignin phenols No significant changes (p = 0.392) were observed along the upstream-downstream transect for the mean values of λ8 (i.e., a proxy for the amount of lignin normalized to OC); The mean value of λ8, a proxy for the amount of lignin normalized to OC, for the soil OC was 44 ± 29 mg g −1 oc . No significant changes (p = 0.392) were observed along the upstream-downstream transect for the mean values of λ8). However, λ8 values revealed significant seasonal changes (p = 0.001). The higher values were observed in the RW (56 ± 30 mg g −1 oc ) and in the FW seasons (62 ± 34 mg g −1 oc ) compared to the HW (23 ± 9 mg g −1 oc ) and LW (29 ± 12 mg g −1 oc ) seasons  (Fig. 4g ). The C : V ratio showed no significant seasonal (p = 0.609) and spatial variation (p = 0.214), and the mean value for all sediments was 0.7 ± 0.4  (Figs. 3d and 4d) . The values of the S : V ratio also do not show significant spatial (p = 0.568) or seasonal (p = 0.08) differences. The mean values for the lakes were approximately 1.1 ± 0.1 and the mean seasonal values varied between 0.9 ± 0.1 and 1.1 ± 0.2 (  Fig. 4e  and  Table 3 ). The mean value of (Ad : Al)v ratio for the different lakes does not show spatial variation (p = 0.137)  (Fig. 3f)  -however, it was higher in the LW (1.5 ± 0.4) and HW (1.7 ± 0.5) seasons (p < 0.001)  (Fig. 4f) . macrophytes. The S : V ratio varied between 0.6 and 0.9 for C 3 macrophytes and between 0.4 and 0.7 for the C 4 macrophytes. The range of C : V ratio was 0.4-3.7 for the C 3 macrophytes and 1.7-4.0 for the C 4 macrophytes. The (Ad : Al)v ratio varied between 0.2 and 0.8 for all macrophyte samples  (Table 3) . For the ""terra firme"" soil and wetland soil samples, the λ8 values varied between 9 and 88 mg g −1 . The S : V ratio varied between 0.5 and 1.1, the C : V ratio varied between 0.2 and 0.5, and the (Ad : Al)v ratio varied between 0.6 and 1.5. 
 BrGDGTs and crenarchaeol Along the upstream-downstream transect, no significant changes (p = 0.371) were observed for the mean values of brGDGTs concentrations  (Fig. 3h) . The lowest value was found in Curuai (31 ± 14 µg g −1 oc ) and the highest one in Canaçari (44 ± 22µg g −1 oc ). The average concentration of crenarchaeol was higher in Canaçari (12 ± 6µg g −1 oc ) when compared to Janauaca (4 ± 3µg g −1 oc ). However, no significant difference (p = 0.127) was observed between the upstream (Cabaliana and Janauaca) lakes and the downstream lake (Curuai)  (Fig. 3h and i) . On the other hand, brGDGTs concentrations showed significant seasonal changes (p = 0.025). The  Table 4 . Values of long-chain n-alkanes δ 13 C in surface sediment samples from the upstream Lake Janauaca and the downstream Lake Curuai. The samples were collected in the LW season. highest mean value for brGDGTs concentrations was found in the FW season (45 ± 23µg g −1 oc ), and the lowest mean concentration was found in the HW season (24 ± 16µg g −1 oc ). The RW and LW seasons showed intermediate mean concentrations (35 ± 12µg g −1 oc and 38 ± 16 µg g −1 oc , respectively) and no significant difference (p = 0.335) was observed if compared to the FW and HW seasons  (Fig. 4h) . The concentrations of crenarchaeol did not reveal significant changes (p = 0.096) over the hydrological seasons  (Fig. 4i) . The mean values varied between 4 ± 4µg g −1 oc and 10 ± 6µg g −1 oc in the HW and LW seasons, respectively. The percentage of IPL brGDGTs and IPL crenarchaeol was significantly higher (p = 0.002 and p < 0.001, respectively) in the LW season (19 ± 7 and 23 ± 9 %, respectively). In the other three seasons, it showed values around 10 ± 2 % of IPL brGDGTs and IPL crenarchaeol with no significant variability  (Table 3) . 
 Long-chain n-alkanes The results of n-alkane analyses are summarized in  Table 4 . The carbon preference indices (CPI), calculated according to  Bray and Evans (1961) , were high, confirming a plant wax origin of the higher n-alkanes. A somewhat lower CPI (3.5) was found in the downstream lake compared to those in the upstream lake (5.5). A significant increase in the δ 13 C values of the long-chain n-alkanes (C 27 , C 29 , C 31 ) was observed downstream. In the upstream lake, the mean δ 13 C for the long-chain n-alkanes was −34.1 ± 0.5 ‰ and in the downstream lake the mean value was −31.6 ± 0.6 ‰  (Table 4) . This represents a difference of 2.5 ‰ from upstream to downstream. 
 Discussion 
 Sources of sedimentary organic matter in the floodplain lakes To determine the origin of the SOM in the floodplain lakes, we considered five potentially significant sources in the central Amazon basin  Moreira-Turcq et al. 2013; Mortillaro et al., 2011):  (1) the terrestrial Andean claybounded and refractory SPOM, which may be transferred to the floodplain lakes via the Solimões-Amazon and Madeira rivers  (Hess et al., 2003) , (2) ""terra firme"" soils and litters of the Amazonian lowland forests (non-floodable forests), which will be transferred to the floodplain lakes via local streams, (3) the wetland soils (flooded forests) and litters  (leaves, grasses, woods, etc.) , transferred to the floodplain lakes during the receding waters (FW season) or in the rainy season (RW season) , (4) the wetland aquatic and semi-aquatic macrophyte vegetation of the floodplain lakes  (Junk, 1997; Moreira-Turcq et al., 2004; Mortillaro et al., 2011) , and (5) phytoplankton from the river or produced in the lake itself  Mortillaro et al., 2011) . The biomarkers analyzed, lignin phenols and GDGTs, enabled us to identify most of these sources of OM, except for planktonic sources. However, in this case, some information can be obtained using bulk parametersi.e., the δ 13 C org and C : N ratio. Our results were compared with data reported previously  Martinelli et al., 1994 Martinelli et al., , 2003 Meyers], 1994; Aufdenkampe et al., 2007; Zell et al., 2013b)  and with specific OM sources sampled and analyzed in this work, such as macrophytes, wetland soil and ""terra firme"" soil  (Table 3) , in order to identify the main sources of SOM in the floodplain lakes. The average values of the various parameters of the river SPOM  (Ertel et al., 1986; Hedges et al., 1986) , wetland soils, ""terra firme"" soils and the potential biological OM sources (phytoplankton, macrophytes, grass, leaves and wood) are compared with those of the SOM of the floodplain lakes in  Fig. 5  and  Table 5 . Data for the riverine SPOM are subdivided into fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) and coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM). For the interpretation of these data, it is important to note that the amount of CPOM in the Amazon River has been reported to be approximately eight times lower than that of the FPOM  (Richey et al., 1990) . The averages of important lignin parameters (λ8, S : V ratio) but also the C : N ratio of the wood samples are significantly different (p < 0.001) from those for the sediments, which clearly indicates only a minor contribution of woody material to the SOM. Furthermore, the λ8 of riverine FPOM is substantially lower than that of the SOM of the floodplain lakes, indicating that riverine SPOM is not an important source of lignin for the SOM of the floodplain lakes either. In terms of lignin parameters, the SOM is distinguished by two clear characteristics. Firstly, the (Ad : Al)v ratio is high with an average value of 1.25  (Fig. 5) . Such a high value is only noted in the wetland and ""terra firme"" soils. However, this ratio is affected by the oxidation state of the lignin, and thus cannot be used as a source characteristic of the lignin. Secondly, the SOM is characterized by a substantially elevated C : V ratio (  Fig. 6 ; see  Hedges et al., 1982) . Since all of the potential lignin sources, except macrophytes, have a much lower value, this indicates that macrophyte lignin and, thus accordingly, macrophyte OM (since average λ8 values of macrophyte OM and the SOM do not substantially differ) largely contribute to the SOM. Since the S : V ratio of macrophyte OM is relatively lower than that of the lignin component of the SOM  (Fig. 5) , some contributions of lignin derived from other fresh plant OM (i.e., Data is based on previous studies  Aufdenkampe et al., 2007; Zell et al., 2013b)  and the present work  (Table 3) . Letters over the boxes indicate significant differences (p < 0.05) between the means.  Table 5 . Average values of biomarkers and bulk parameters in the possible sources of SOM and in sediment samples. The data were obtained in the present work and from the literature  Hedges and Mann, 1979; Aufdenkampe et al., 2007) . grasses/leaves) or wetland soils might explain the elevated S : V ratio of the SOM. Further information with respect to sources of SOM can be obtained from the GDGT concentrations. The concentrations of both brGDGTs and crenarchaeol are higher in the riverine SPOM than in the SOM, pointing to a contribution of riverine SPOM to the SOM, in contrast to what was shown by the lignin phenols. However, the concentrations of brGDGTs in the wetland soils and river SPOM are statistically indistinguishable and, thus, it is not possible to use the brGDGTs as a specific OM source indicator. This is in line with the idea that brGDGTs can be produced in soils (e.g.,  Weijers et al., 2006) , rivers (e.g.,  Zell et al., 2013a; De Jonge et al., 2015)  and lake waters (e.g.,  Tierney et al., 2010; Buckles et al., 2014) . On the other hand, riverine SPOM is the most likely OM source for the substantially increased concentration of crenarchaeol in the SOM of the floodplain lakes if compared to other sources  (Fig. 5) . Crenarchaeol is indeed produced in the Amazon River by nitrifying archaea that consume ammonium produced from degrading OM  (Zell et al., 2013b) . However, it is known that crenarchaeol is also produced in lakes  (Blaga et al., 2011; Tierney and Russell, 2009) , indicating that it may also be produced in the floodplain lakes. Crenarchaeol is, therefore, considered as an indicator of aquatic OM in this system. The enhanced concentrations of crenarchaeol in SOM thus indicate an increased contribution from riverine and/or lacustrine SPOM. TOC C : N δ 13 C org C : V S : V (Ad : Al)v λ8 brGDGTs crenarchaeol (wt. %) (‰ VPDB) (mg g −1 OC ) (µg g −1 OC ) (µg g −1 OC ) Wetland In terms of bulk parameters, the C : N ratio in the SOM shows intermediate values between the riverine SPOM and the various OM sources but with no distinct average values between them. Moreover, the average values of δ 13 C org are statistically equal for sediments and most sources of OM (except for the wetland soils), and the TOC do not show any significant difference between the soils samples (p = 1.241), riverine SPOM (p = 1.044) and lake sediments. Thus, it is not possible to discriminate any specific source of SOM based on the average values of the bulk parameters. We have argued that the C : V ratio and the crenarchaeol concentration are the only two parameters that clearly point out one specific source of SOM (i.e., macrophytes and aquatic OM from rivers or floodplain lakes, respectively). Consequently, these parameters can be applied to a two endmember model to estimate the fractions of each of these two sources in the SOM. According to this approach  (Martinelli et al., 2003) , the average C : V values of macrophytes and the average values of other OM sources (wetland and non-flooded soils and SPOM) can be used to estimate the contribution of macrophyte OM to the SOM (Eq. 1). Similarly, the concentration of crenarchaeol in the riverine SPOM and its concentration in soil samples can be used to estimate the contribution of aquatic OM to the SOM (Eq. 2): F macrophytes = C : V SOM − C : V (SPOM + forest) C : V macrophyte − C : V (SPOM + forest) × 100 (1) F SPOM = Cren SOM − Cren (forest + macrophyte) Cren SPOM − Cren (forest + macrophyte) × 100 (2) F macrophyte + F SPOM + F forest = SOM (100%) . (3) In Eqs.  (1)  and  (2)    (Table 6 ). As discussed above, the high values of (Ad : Al)v indicate that lignin components of the SOM is partially degraded, which may affect the values of the C : V ratio. There are also numerous complications with the application of crenarchaeol as an indicator of aquatic matter in this ecosystem. Therefore, the presented mixing model should be considered as estimations. The results of Eqs. (1-3) indicate that 25-35 % of the SOM is derived from macrophytes and 20-30 % from aquatic OM sources (riverine and lacustrine SPOM) . Consequently, the remaining 35-55 % of the SOM might be derived from the wetlands and non-flooded forests (Eq. 3). The periodic floods link the floodplain lakes and the wetland vegetation and soil. Thus, the seasonal and spatial contrasts in the SOM should be investigated in order to better understand the connectivity between these compartments. 
 Spatial differences in the composition of sedimentary organic matter Along the longitudinal transect, from upstream to downstream, most bulk geochemical parameters (i.e., TOC content and δ 13 C org ) show significant differences between the upstream and downstream lakes  (Fig. 3a, c) , while most of the R. L. Sobrinho et al.: Spatial and seasonal contrasts of sedimentary organic matter measured biomarker parameters (λ8, S : V , (Ad : Al)v and brGDGTs) do not show such a pattern  (Fig. 4e-h) . On the other hand, the biomarker parameters show, in some cases, a clear seasonal contrast, which is not observed for the bulk parameters. Consequently, the bulk parameters apparently mix and homogenize the long timescale (year), while the biomarkers are more sensible to changes in short timescale (months) at the sediment surface. This observation is in agreement with previous studies about earlier diagenesis of organic molecules  (Harvey, 2006) . It is important to note that the results must be interpreted taking into consideration the high sedimentation rates in the floodplain lakes, typically 1-2 cm yr −1 , and the fact that resuspension is induced by storms during the LW and RW seasons or by currents during the receding waters (FW). These events may have a substantial effect on the material comprising the first 2 cm of sediments of floodplain lakes, which are mixed with newly arrived SOM from the water column, and are re-oxygenated favoring the degradation. The percentage of TOC in the sediment samples shows a decrease from 3.3 (wt. %) upstream (Cabaliana) to 2.1 (wt. %) downstream (Curuai)  (Fig. 3a) . Furthermore, over the transect of lakes the average δ 13 C org values increase by ca. 5 ‰  (Fig. 3c) . However, the average C : N ratio does not show any significant changes over the transect  (Fig. 3b) . These results are in good agreement with previous studies in the central Amazon basin  (Victoria et al., 1992; Martinelli et al., 2003) . The increasing trend in δ 13 C org from upstream to downstream lakes may be caused by an increased contribution of C 4 macrophytes to the SOM, whose abundance increases in open water lakes and floodplains. Alternatively, since the δ 13 C org values in the downstream lakes come closer to the δ 13 C org of the Solimões-Amazon SPOM (∼ −23 to −30 ‰), an increased input of riverine organic matter may also explain this. To disentangle whether this trend in the δ 13 C org values is caused by an increased contribution of C 4 plants or of riverine SPOM, the isotopic composition (δ 13 C) of long-chain n-alkanes, markers for higher plants, in sediments from the upstream Lake Janauaca and the downstream Lake Curuai, both collected during the LW season, was measured. The results  (Table 4)  show that the long-chain n-alkanes δ 13 C signature are more like those of C 3 higher plants  (Castañeda et al., 2009)  for both lakes although for the Curuai the values are slightly less negative. If one considers the values of δ 13 C in the n-alkane C 29 in the leaf waxes of C 3 and C 4 plants, one can calculate the contribution of C 4 plants sedimentary n-alkanes according to the following equation: C 4 plants(%) = δ 13 C org C 29 (C 3 plants) − δ 13 C org C 29 (sediment) δ 13 C org C 29 (C 3 plants) − δ 13 C org C 29 (C 4 plants) × 100, (4) where the end member value for δ 13 C org C 29 (C 3 plants) is listed in  Table 4 . Accordingly, the fraction of C 4 plants in the SOM in the upstream lake is only 3 %, but for the downstream lake 22 %. The difference in δ 13 C org for C 4 and C 3 higher plants is ca. 20 ‰ . A switch from almost 100 % C 3 macrophytes to a 78 % contribution would result in a change in the isotopic composition of the macrophyte ""pool"" of the SOM of 4-4.5 ‰ . Since this pool is estimated to represent 20-30 % of the SOM, this cannot fully explain the observed 5 ‰ shift  (Fig. 3c ). However, it should be considered that this increasing contribution of C 4 higher plants in the downstream lake may not solely be the consequence of the change in the composition of the contributing aquatic macrophytes, but that also changes in the floodplain soil, mainly covered by shrubs and grass vegetation, may contribute to the observed shift in δ 13 C org of SOM. 
 Seasonal changes in the composition of sedimentary organic matter The two centimeters of surface sediment we have characterized in this study potentially integrate more than 1 year of sedimentation in such floodplain environment . However, because of the occurrence of pulsated inputs as well as resuspension, mixing and degradation processes in these superficial sediments , changes in the composition of superficial sediment apparently occurred at the seasonal scale (  Fig. 4  and  Table 3 ). Indeed, the λ8 values showed significantly higher values in the RW and FW seasons than in the LW and HW seasons in all lakes (Figs. 4e-g, and 6a). The mean concentrations of brGDGTs also showed higher values in the FW season than in the HW season  (Figs. 4h and 6b) . The cooccurrence of these two types of molecules indicates that litter, traced by lignin phenols, and superficial soils, traced by brGDGTs, are preferentially deposited in the floodplain lakes during rising and receding waters. In addition, the seasonal mean values of (Ad : Al)v showed remarkably lower values in the RW and FW seasons  (Fig. 4f) , an inverse pattern if compared to the λ8 and brGDGTs. This suggests that less degraded lignin phenols were present in the surface sediments in the RW and FW seasons. Thus, in this case, the increase in the concentrations of the organic compounds was not a consequence of the resuspension of the sediments, but due to a sudden arrival of fresher OM. In the HW and LW seasons, more degraded lignin phenols (i.e., higher values of Ad : Alv) were present in the sediments concomitant with lower amounts of λ8. A possible process which is responsible for the λ8 and brGDGTs transfer to the lakes' sediments is the connection of the Amazon River main stem with the local catchment areas such as wetlands and non-flooded forests during the RW and FW seasons. The lignin concentration could also increase as a consequence of the macrophyte communities while the brGDGTs could increase due to the in situ production in the floodplain lakes. However, the concentrations of crenarchaeol and IPL brGDGTs as well as C : V ratio do not reveal significant seasonal changes  (Table 3  and  Fig. 4 ). Based on these observations, we interpret that these changes in the lignin phenols in the RW and FW seasons and the brGDGTs in the FW season were not derived from the lake in situ production but from soil and leaf runoffs. Previous studies postulated that Andean and lowland soils are mainly transferred to the lakes via the Amazon River main stem, in particular during the RW and HW seasons and that they would be the main source of SOM in the floodplain lakes (e.g.,  Victoria et al., 1992; Moreira-Turcq et al., 2004; Mortillaro et al., 2011) . However, according to our results, the lignin phenols increased their concentration in the RW and the FW seasons. The hydrodynamics of floodplain lakes and their connections to the local drainage flooded forests and the main stem  (Bourgoin et al., 2007; Bonnet et al., 2008) , and the analysis of biomarkers applied in this study, suggest that in the RW and FW seasons, these organic molecules are mainly derived from the drainage of local wetlands and lowland ""terra firme"" soils. This is more evident for the upstream lakes surrounded by larger flooded forests than for the downstream lakes surrounded mainly by grass vegetation and shrubs. Even if in Lake Curuai, phytoplankton primary production and the riverine SPOM are potentially important sources of SOM  Zocatelli et al., 2013) , this material is not predominant in the sediments, compared to the material coming from the interface between the lake and the wetland, which is determinant for the sedimentation of the organic compounds. 
 Conclusion Our results suggest that the vegetation coverage of the wetlands (flooded forests) and ""terra firme"" (non-floodable forests) in the local catchment area of each lake investigated is the most important source of SOM in floodplain lakes of the central Amazon basin. The macrophyte community is also an important source of SOM whereas aquatic OM (i.e., riverine and lacustrine SPOM) contributes to a somewhat lesser extent. In upstream lakes, higher TOC contents in the surface sediments are observed, if compared to the downstream large open lakes. The differences observed in the vegetation coverage of the wetlands affect the quality of SOM in the floodplain lakes. This pattern could only be observed in a longitudinal transect approach, with the application of molecular isotope technique apart from multiple-biomarker analysis. The sedimentation of OM in the floodplain lakes are strongly linked to the periodic floods. The rain season (RW season), with substantially increased soil runoff, and the receding of waters (FW season), when OM is transported from the flooded soils to the floodplain lakes, are the most important hydrological factors for the sedimentation of OM in the wetlands of the central Amazon basin. Hence, together with wetland and non-flooded vegetation, the hydrodynamics of the floodplain seems to be the most important controlling factor on the composition of SOM in the floodplain lakes of the central Amazon basin.

Enrichment planting is justified by the small number of commercial forest species, which will still be the same species in fifty years' time because they have the best technical properties. A for¬est enriched with okoumé, limbo and niangon to produce 50 or 60 commercially valuable trees per hectare will therefore always have more value than a wild for¬est. Enrichment is also justified by the increasing rarity of the most sought-after species, which cannot regenerate under dense cover. For example, we know that the abundance of okoumé in certain areas is the result of early human settlements that have since disappeared. Enrichment is also justified as a means of preventing logging from encroaching into the entire forest and gradually destroying it. Sawmills often decimate the forest surrounding them, and forest roads contribute to its fragmentation until crop fields take over the soil entirely. With no listing of protected forests and no silviculture, within just a few decades there would be no more economically viable forestry and no more forest industries manufacturing timber products for export.

 RÉSUMÉ 
 FORÊTS SAUVAGES OU SYLVICULTURE Dans les pays forestiers du Golfe de Guinée, l'enrichissement des forêts denses, naturellement très pauvres en essences commercialisables, a vu le jour dans les années 1920. Il apparaît en effet indispensable de compenser les pertes de l'exploitation par des opérations sylvicoles qui assureront la reconstitution de la composition primitive en bonnes espèces. Une telle activité, parfois vivement détractée, mais qui convertirait pourtant favorablement des forêts sauvages en forêts valorisables, ne peut être conçue que dans la durée. Cela n'est possible que si les moyens mis à disposition des forestiers sont garantis durablement. L'enrichissement se justifie par le faible nombre d'essences forestières commercialisées, lesquelles demeureront les mêmes dans cinquante ans parce qu'elles disposent des meilleures propriétés technologiques. Une forêt enrichie en okoumés, limbos et niangons, avec une production de 50 à 60 arbres exploitables par hectare, aura donc toujours plus de valeur qu'une forêt sauvage. Cet enrichissement est justifié par la raréfaction progressive des espèces les plus exploitées, inaptes à se renouveler sous un couvert dense. On sait par exemple que les zones riches en okoumés ne le sont que parce qu'elles ont été précédées par l'occupation ancienne de populations humaines qui ont depuis disparu. L'enrichissement se justifie aussi pour éviter que l'exploitation ne se diffuse à l'ensemble des massifs forestiers et entraîne progressivement leur disparition. Les scieries font en effet souvent le vide autour d'elles, et les pistes forestières concourent au mitage des forêts, jusqu'à leur mise en valeur agricole. Sans classement de forêts et sans sylviculture, il n'y aura plus, dans quelques dizaines d'années, ni forêts économiquement exploitable, ni industries forestières en vue du commerce d'exportation.

 ABSTRACT 
 WILD FORESTS OR SILVICULTURE In the forested countries around the Gulf of Guinea, enrichment planting in dense forests with few naturally occurring commercial species began in the 1920s. It is clearly necessary to offset forest losses from logging by conducting silvicultural operations to reconstitute a forest's initial composition using suitable species. Such a strategy, which is sometimes strongly opposed but would convert wild forests into forests with greater potential value, can only be applied with a view to the long term. And this is only possible if the means provided to foresters are guaranteed over the long term. Enrichment planting is justified by the small number of commercial forest species, which will still be the same species in fifty years' time because they have the best technical properties. A forest enriched with okoumé, limbo and niangon to produce 50 or 60 commercially valuable trees per hectare will therefore always have more value than a wild forest. Enrichment is also justified by the increasing rarity of the most sought-after species, which cannot regenerate under dense cover. For example, we know that the abundance of okoumé in certain areas is the result of early human settlements that have since disappeared. Enrichment is also justified as a means of preventing logging from encroaching into the entire forest and gradually destroying it. Sawmills often decimate the forest surrounding them, and forest roads contribute to its fragmentation until cropfields take over the soil entirely. With no listing of protected forests and no silviculture, within just a few decades there would be no more economically viable forestry and no more forest industries manufacturing timber products for export.

 RESUMEN 
 BOSQUES VÍRGENES O SILVICULTURA En los países forestales del golfo de Guinea, el enriquecimiento de las selvas, naturalmente escasas en especies comercializables, surgió en la década de 1920. Parece pues imprescindible compensar las pérdidas causadas por la explotación mediante operaciones silvícolas que garanticen la reconstitución de la composición primitiva con las especies adecuadas. Esta actividad, en ocasiones fuertemente criticada, a pesar de lo favorable que sería convertir estos bosques salvajes en bosques aprovechables, sólo puede plantearse como un proyecto de largo recorrido. Esto sólo es posible garantizando de modo duradero los medios puestos a disposición de los dasónomos. El enriquecimiento se justifica por el reducido número de especies forestales comercializadas que, además, seguirán siendo las mismas dentro de cincuenta años porque son las que tienen mejores propiedades tecnológicas. Un bosque enriquecido con okumé, limba y niangón, con una producción de 50 a 60 árboles aprovechables por hectárea, tendrá siempre más valor que un bosque salvaje. Dicho enriquecimiento se justifica por la progresiva rarefacción de las especies más explotadas, inaptas para renovarse bajo cobertura densa. Sabemos, por ejemplo, que las zonas con abundancia de okumés lo son porque fueron precedidas por antiguas ocupaciones humanas que posteriormente desaparecieron. El enriquecimiento también se justifica para evitar que la explotación se extienda al conjunto de las masas forestales y conlleve paulatinamente su desaparición. En efecto, los aserraderos suelen crear espacios vacíos a su alrededor y los caminos forestales contribuyen a la merma de los bosques hasta llegar al desmonte para su desarrollo agrícola. Sin protección de los bosques y sin silvicultura, dentro de unas décadas ya no existirán bosques económicamente aprovechables, ni industrias forestales con miras al comercio de exportación.

Any forestry programme must be designed for the long term. It always takes many years for a young forest tree to ensure its survival. It needs long-term care, failing which it will die of suffocation. Unfortunately, such programmes, precisely because they are designed for the long term, imply equally long-term consent from its promoters and particularly from those who commission and finance the work and from the politicians who hold the purse strings in mainland France. Yet such sustained determination is rarely to be found, if at all, in human efforts. Changing circumstances, fashions, reformers, detractors: people's minds are perpetually changing, sometimes in favour and sometimes not. Whether a forestry programme is opportune will inevitably be questioned sooner or later. Like every long-term human endeavour, it will always be subject to criticism. We must keep robust arguments close to hand, ready to pull out from the files in which they lie, we must ceaselessly strive to persuade thanks to the power of our reasoning and the evidence of hard fact. Success always comes at the end of the road to those who are sure of their arguments and their determination, and provided time is on their side. It is because our ideas on forest enrichment are presently causing surprise in some quarters, and disenchantment or fatigue in others, that I believe fresh exhortations are needed to move into a new phase, or in other words, to take us up to the next wave of criticism and ensure that those who have followed the right path up to now are not troubled in their conscience. Dense equatorial forests, or rainforests as they have come to be known, are heterogeneous; with few exceptions, different tree species coexist in colourful company. Within this patchwork, only a few species have attracted commercial interest -no more than thirty species along the entire West African coast have done so. All the others, the many hundreds of ""miscellaneous trees"", are discarded as having no commercial value. Technical knowledge has in fact confirmed these initial commercial choices almost exactly, occasionally adding a few species to the existing list. It is said that African forests contain few useful species, a fact confirmed by more than 50 years of logging and trade. Hence the call for silviculture, whose tasks appear to lie plainly ahead. From its distant past, the African continent has inherited the wildness of its disordered forests, which it is the task of foresters to domesticate in order to supply the timber needs of our European civilisation. But they must obviously do so with care, because they know that nature cannot be misused. Hence the idea of silvicultural enrichment. Oh, but African foresters are always modest in their ambitions. They would consider themselves fortunate, those of the present generation at least, if, in the places where Africa's age-old nature sparingly offers them one or two usable trees per hectare, they could leave the next generation with 20 or 30 such trees, and more if possible. And more is indeed possible: we can now expect to see 50 to 60 large usable trees per hectare, or 300 to 400 metric tons of high-quality timber. But we also know that we should not tempt the forest spirits to take their revenge by destroying efforts that we have arrogantly ill-conceived. Let us leave the next generation, or the next again, with the task of perfecting the enrichment of the forests they will inherit. Thus did the first foresters first envision their silvicultural tasks. They sought and experimented with various methods, giving their preference to one or more depending on sites, species and tendencies. All had to fulfil the same condition: their low cost per unit area transformed. It is clear that we cannot spend as much money on trees that must grow for 50 to 80 years before they are felled as on plantations that will yield a profit within just a few years. I will return later to the results of this early silvicultural work; for now, my immediate concern is to challenge the objections that arise. First, the foundations: are they based on solid ground? Our detractors are those who do not know, those who doubt, and those who are selfishly indifferent. I will first address the former. They are in good faith, and perhaps will one day become our most ardent advocates. Why should we cultivate tropical forests? They are eternal. Does not the logger who, among the larger trees, has felled those -and only those -of interest to those who use them, not leave behind small trees of every type that will spontaneously grow to replace their vanished forebears? Is this not how our forests in France are continuously felled and re-established? The answer is more complex and more subtle than this simple question. Among the species used, many are known to be light-demanding. Left in the undergrowth of the vast shadowy forest, their descendants can only vegetate and gradually die. This is why there are so few saplings of lightdemanding species and why, when they are found, they are often as sickly as deformed children, too puny for any care to transform them into healthy and vigorous individuals. This is the case with African mahogany, and to a lesser extent with limba, framire, other mahoganies, ilomba, azobé, etc. Thus, when large trees of these light-demanding species are removed, what remains is a feeble, stunted population of descendants with poor chances of survival. Furthermore, the clearings made by felling are soon colonised by seedlings of the species that remain standing, those that cannot be used. In short, as I will not go into all the details that would not change my overall conclusion, this is how a forest from which the best light-demanding trees are extracted will eventually become exhausted. But how, then, can we account for the fact that in a hectare of wild forest, one or two of the fine trees such as those that were felled will still be found? This is an average figure, because in some cases, five or six niangon trees may be found per hectare for example, and 10 to 20 okoumé. Here we must turn to the mysteries of forest regeneration. Not all have been elucidated, and a great deal of observation and patience are required. When large groups of okoumé and limba, for example, are found in a forest, this is a sign of early occupation by man. Okoumé in particular will only regenerate in open spaces, such as clearings made for crops. The relative abundance of okoumé in some forests in Gabon undoubtedly indicates that they were inhabited in the past by farming populations who later vanished. Two successive conditions had to be fulfilled to create this abundance of exploitable okoumé trees: first, a human community that created a clearing, then that population's disappearance. The same is true for framiré If we do not remedy this situation, logging, and the timber industry as a whole, will disappear in Africa. Thus, a paradox looms in the not too distant future: the disappearance of the timber industry in Africa, even as, given the reputation of Equatorial Africa's forests, we should expect it to expand. Large tracts of forest will always remain, of course, but far in the interior, beyond the reach of economically viable transport to export their timber. The vast timber reserves of equatorial forests will have become an illusion, their potential for production and revenue wasted and destroyed. It is therefore essential to create productive forest preserves in the most easily accessible coastal regions. The operating expenses will need to be offset through silvicultural work to reconstitute, at the very least, the initial composition of the forest in useful species. These objectives have not yet been achieved, however, despite the enrichment programmes conducted with FIDES funding. In Gabon, for example, 300,000 to 350,000 metric tons of okoumé are removed each year. At present, the plantations established by the Forestry Service can only guarantee, once they are mature, 75,000 metric tons of timber production, and only for as long as it receives the credits currently awarded by the FIDES. and ilomba, amongst others. These species only sporadically reproduce in primary forests, in clearings formed accidentally by high winds, for example. Today, such conditions still occur but rarely: cultivation is more intensive, population density is increasing, fallow periods are becoming shorter and fewer large trees are kept in cropfields: in short, the chances of natural repopulation by useful species are lessened. All these circumstances work against the reconstitution of a forest's initial value in terms of useful species. It is well known that as soon as a logging road is opened up, a patchwork of plantations quickly becomes established along it, while slashing and burning for crops begins to reach into the interior. The edges of untouched forest recede around economic centres and sawmills, so that supplies have to be transported over ever greater distances, with more difficulty and more expense. The sawmills create a vacuum around themselves; they remove the best timber and farmers destroy the rest, including the preexisting natural vegetation on which our hopes for the forest's regeneration might have been founded. In France, forests are permanent and managed to be exploited indefinitely. In Africa, sawmills will one day lack supplies for lack of elementary precautions to protect the forests around them.

Is this not a waste of resources? The better option is surely to fell the trees in today's wild forests, where future generations may find the species they need, rather than persist with ill-judged enrichment that may serve no useful purpose. In short, the enrichment policy is an illusion. 2° Mechanical and chemical timber processing industries are making tremendous strides and are increasingly using disorganised woody material with no distinction between different timber species. We are moving towards a time when these industries will be able to use every kind of tropical timber, but when today's foresters carry out enrichment planting, they partly, and sometimes completely, destroy the natural forest by replacing it with a different forest which is more useful to them. But this is surely also a waste of resources and raw materials! Silviculture could actually become uneconomic and the expenditures it requires would be made to no purpose. 3° Traditional uses of wood are losing ground every day to competing new materials, such as cement, plastics and metals, which are more convenient to use and more economic. So, why persist with silviculture? We could even let the forests disappear if such is to be their fate. At most, we should preserve it in those places where it is said to have a useful role in protecting soils and water and moderating the climate. We should certainly not be wasting budgets that are ready too limited on conserving exploitable forests, and especially not on silviculture. We need to take a hard look at the situation. For 50 years, we have been extracting forest capital on the West Coast of Africa whenever it has been economically viable to do so. This capital is being depleted year by year and is barely being replenished, if at all. The logging front is moving further into the interior and will soon reach the limit beyond which will no longer be economically viable to export the timber. Already, some of the best species are becoming scarce. Fortunately, there are still unexploited forests where logging will become possible as means of transport develop. These are our last reserves, after which only the preserves that foresters have enriched will remain. Today's purely extractive and exploratory logging will inevitably disappear. Loggers will no longer return to previously felled areas because they will have been cleared, or will contain so little usable timber that felling will no longer be viable. Have I convinced those who did not know and therefore could not see what may lie ahead? I hope so, and I will now turn to those who doubt. They already know, perhaps, but they are sophists and they will be more difficult to persuade. I shall try nevertheless. I believe I can summarise their arguments in three points: 1° Among all forest species, we have been able to select the most useful, but will these choices satisfy needs in a hundred years' time? Species we have no use for at present may become those most sought-after, and the future may treat our prized okoumé, mahogany or niangon with scorn. If we bear this possibility in mind, should we really be enriching Long before logging by the white man, Africans had already chosen mahogany, okoumé, iroko and others to meet their needs. These are the trees that produce the best timber today, but also for tomorrow, from every point of view. Some uses will disappear, but others will emerge for which the same timber will be used because they have the best physical and mechanical characteristics. Two hundred years ago, the magnificent old oak forests in western France were used to build ships. Their wood has now been replaced by steel for shipbuilding, but with the development of modern sawmills, it has taken on new value. Today, more than ever, the whole of Europe is buying the timber planted for Colbert's navy in the Forest of Tronçais. Okoumé is the best species for veneer. Because it is also abundant in the forests of Gabon, it has become a source of wealth for equatorial Africa. But okoumé also supplies an excellent material for fibreboard and paper pulp, although it is not used for these purposes because it is too expensive and already in great demand for veneer. It is also well suited to light carpentry. Okoumé timber is soft and resilient and will continue to be appreciated for a wide range of uses, and it is In short, let us not worry about the consequences for forests, even if we see they are declining or even dying off. For now, we should put aside our requests for credits from the FIDES and the local assemblies. 100 years is usually the time allotted for a forest plantation to become viable. In France, it takes two centuries to create a high oak stand. In equatorial Africa, we can expect less time. Half a century is probably enough for our softwood species such as okoumé, ilomba, limba or fraké, and 80 years for mahogany and similar timber. It is true that at this age, which is an average human lifespan, we will no longer find the giant trees we are felling today, with diameters of 1.50 to 3 m, but trees 70 to 80 cm in diameter and 30 to 40 m high are still fine commercial trees. But can we predict what the use value of different species is likely to be in 50 or 80 years' time? If we look back half a century, we will see that the choices made in the early 20th century are exactly the same as today. We were just beginning to discover the African mahogany and okoumé, which are still equally prized and whose depletion we are beginning to deplore. In fact, the choices made were founded on the intrinsic qualities of the timber.

Under good soil and maintenance conditions, okoumé plantations can be exploited after 50 years. Better then to accept the risk involved in silvicultural management than to have to take responsibility for refusing to create a source of wealth in Africa's forests, and to take advantage of the existing situation where logging can prosper. As long as wood continues to be used as a material, the preference will be for mahogany, niangon, cherry mahogany, etc., because of their quality. The only reason why they are not more widely used at present is simply that their rarity in our African forests makes the cost of production relatively high. They will never be surpassed by any other African species. The choice is a good one. New species may appear on the market but they are not better. They are accepted as substitutes because the older species are no longer abundant. Technical progress in the mechanical and chemical timber industries is indisputable, and brings new hope for the future of our tropical forests. The most encouraging recent demonstration is the example of the Colonial Cellulose Industrial Board (Régie industrielle de la cellulose coloniale), whose paper mill in Côte d'Ivoire is manufacturing paper commercially from a mixture of hard and soft wood from the surrounding heterogeneous forest. There is hope today that it will become possible to use a wide range of tropical timber to manufacture cellulose pulp, fibreboard and perhaps, in the future, crystallised glucose, yeasts for the food industry, furfural, fuel, fertilisers and so on. Possibilities for wood distilling and especially hydrolysis were the subject of an article Photo 5. Establishing forest plantations in sites initially cleared for subsistence crops can produce better results in terms of tree growth when softwood species are used.

These industries of tomorrow, therefore, are raising our hopes of using more tropical species, but not all, either for technical reasons or because yields are insufficient. Furthermore, it will always be preferable, for an industry, to exploit relatively homogeneous forests comprising selected species, rather than the wild multi-species forests we have at present. The reason why we use the latter, as they stand and despite the many disadvantages, is that they are all we have: we have to try to use the raw material that exists as long as we can calculate that the disadvantages will be compensated by its low cost. Even for the industries of tomorrow, it is likely that forests with an abundance of okoumé, limba, niangon, etc. will be more valuable than wild forests. Okoumé is an excellent species for paper pulp, niangon is also among the very best we have found in Côte d'Ivoire, and the same goes for limba in the Congo. Can it be coincidence that these fine species are the most sought-after for paper manufacture? We come now to the third type of argument. Will we still be using wood a hundred years from now? The same question could have been asked a century ago, yet the tropical species known at the time -mahogany, teak, rosewood, ebony -are still as prized as ever, despite changing fashions in furniture as tastes change from dark to light wood and back. It is true that some uses of wood are declining, as other materials compete for its many uses. But wood is holding its own. We are finding new ways of using wood that overcome some I published in the ""Revue des Eaux et Forêts"" [Water and Forestry Journal] in 1939, entitled ""L'utilisation totale des bois tropicaux dans l'Ouest africain"" [Total use of tropical timber in West Africa]. I still have great confidence in the possibilities for chemical treatment of wood materials, regardless of species, although my enthusiasm is now based on more solid ground thanks to the experience acquired with tropical timber in this area since before the war. As regards cellulose pulp for example, many kinds of tropical timber cannot be used in combination, for technological reasons (almost impossible to cut or badly deformed trunks), for chemical reasons (Ebenaceae) or because the paper produced is too poor in quality. As regards hydrolysis of tropical timber, the studies by Professor Savard have shown that certain hydrolysis fluids are not fermentable. Hydrolysing wood mixtures would be very difficult, as different types of wood do not react in the same way. But yields are perhaps, and especially, the main problem; they are high with certain types of wood and average, mediocre or decidedly poor with others. For all chemical timber industries, if only from the profitability angle, the question of selection and elimination therefore arises. A machine that could handle every kind of wood without previous sorting has not yet been invented. The Lacotte gasifier is perhaps the only existing type of apparatus capable of indiscriminately consuming any kind of wood, but using it in the tropics is still problematical. The synthetic fuel it would produce does not seem likely to become widely used at a Photo 8. View of an okoumé plantation established in 1947. After thinning, the young six-year-old trees are still numerous. Note the light ground cover provided by the stand. Cape Esterias listed forest,  Gabon. November 1953 . Photograph A. Aubréville, 1953  programmes provide for 20 years of reforestation and enrichment planting over a total of 16,044,915 hectares. Our programmes in Africa, and especially the credits that determine their implementation, are small indeed compared to others. The risk involved in undertaking semi-intensive silviculture over a few thousand hectares each year is non-existent. There is nothing forcing us to slow down the efforts we have begun, quite the contrary. The third group of detractors are of much greater concern than the other two because they deny nothing, neither the truth of our ideas, nor the usefulness of silvicultural programmes, but prefer to merely acknowledge the principle without putting it into practice. They maintain that the amount of investment capital available in African territories is unfortunately too low given the scale of the infrastructure to be developed in every economic and social field -which is all too true. But they add that under these conditions, any available capital should be reserved for the most urgent operations, which can be undertaken now for immediate gain -bridges, roads, railways, electrification, etc. -rather than spent, if only in part, on silvicultural operations that will only become profitable in the long term. This is a highly dangerous argument because it rests on the selfishness of one generation and because such appeals are readily heard. I have shown that logging practice today, like clearing dense forest for crops, is consuming the natural capital that is nature's legacy. If we do not apply policies for forest protection and reconstitution, this capital will soon be lost forever. Without forest protection and without silvi-culture, within a few decades there will be no more economically exploitable forests and no more forest industries to export their timber. It is not right that today's of its disadvantages: plywood, veneers and boards of every kind. Paper consumption is steadily increasing, and even traditional uses of wood are still in favour. Metal furniture is soon outmoded, easily damaged, disagreeable to the touch and hard to repair, and unlikely to dethrone its counterparts made from wood. Wooden houses are still widespread in industrialised countries, such as the United States, which have abundant materials of every type, while in Africa, those who live in concrete houses where every passing truck makes it impossible to hear oneself speak may well regret that in these poor countries, for lack resources and finance, we have given priority to cement over wood. But let us not take these considerations too far: if we continue to follow those who prophesy the demise of wood as a material in the next 50 or 100 years and who would abandon our wild forests to their fate as a result, we may well incur the reproaches of future generations who, very probably, will still need wood and will go to find it in those countries that have created reserves. No, the decline of wood is not upon us. If we refer to a very recent report from the second joint meeting of the EEC timber committee and the FAO's European forests commission, held in Rome from 8 to 12 October 1953, we will see that European consumption of high-quality and industrial timber is tending to rise, that we need to increase timber production, to augment national afforestation programmes and improve forest management to ensure that we are better able to satisfy increased demand in the long term, and that governments must ensure that their forests receive the benefit of intensive silviculture by maintaining forestry personnel and the necessary budgets. Such is the opinion expressed recently by European timber economics specialists, who have studied its trends and prospects. Current European Some doubts may yet remain over the possibilities for transforming wild forests through the inevitably rudimentary silviculture now applied from Côte d'Ivoire to the Congo. I have already published notes and figures in this Journal on how the first plantations in Côte d'Ivoire and the Congo have evolved, and do not think I need to return to this subject here. The photographs in these pages show more clearly than any report what has been achieved so far, and also what we can hope for based on observations of natural stands. Silvicultural techniques can still be improved and perseverance is essential. I will nevertheless report some significant figures obtained during my recent tour in Gabon. Felling had just taken place in one of the early okoumé plantations established in Cape Esterias forest near Libreville, in 1944. After thinning and removing badly formed, forked or suppressed trees, 82 trees remained on the 0.25 ha. surveyed, or 328 per hectare, which is a significant number. The dominant trees averaged 26 m in height and 22 centimetres in diameter; the best tree was 33 m high and 39 cm in diameter. This is surely more than encouraging for young nine-year-old okoumé trees. Our defence of the silvicultural methods applied by our forestry services in Africa also has another purpose. Reconstituting a forest to improve logging efficiency, thanks to the greater concentration of future usable timber, is essential on the African coast, but it is possible to take the matter further. As I have already had occasion to report, equatorial Africa's warm, humid climate is naturally favourable to the production of timber and all cellulose-based products. Its forests cover vast areas whose value will never be fully realised by permanent crops, given the sparse population and the limited market for agricultural exports from the tropics. However, in zones that are served by harbours, forests that can be usefully exploited can fall victim to clearing, while silviculture could transform the most accessible stands into improved forests that would become a significant source of wealth in just half a century. The same problems arise in all tropical countries across the world, in a similar context of indifference and incomprehension as regards forestry matters. Those who overcome this selfish indifference and who, alone or ahead of others, succeed in creating wealth from forests thanks to protection and silviculture, will become leaders in the international timber trade. There is no great risk in adopting policies to create future wealth from forests, only great chances of success. So why not apply such a policy, using the financial resources available to the limit! Enough wild forests will always remain, far in the interior from the Atlantic Ocean to the furthest reaches of the Congo basin, but we must look to silviculture to transform vast tracts in the middle and lower reaches of the forest basins that contain the fine species we ready know. Long life and honour to tropical silviculture! generation should squander all this capital for its own gain, thus ruining the prospects of generations to come. In all decency, we should at a minimum replant as many trees as we have felled. As I have already said, we are a long way from doing so. It is of course tempting to consider as a fact of life that today's forests will become exhausted and to reserve all our financial resources, including those produced by the selfsame forests, for operations that provide immediate gain. Fortunately, this egocentric idea is not generally accepted in our territories, or by the Ministry for Overseas France, or by the FIDES steering committee, but still lurks below the surface, as menacing as a conger eel. It was to protect our forestry programmes from possible cutbacks that we established a forestry fund for Overseas France that would be financed in part by current forest revenues. This fund is essential to ensure the continuity of forestry activities. The local assemblies must take part in their management to be sure that the money is spent in the interests of each territory. It is now a matter of urgency to protect the credits earmarked for forests from selfish appetites.

This activity has continued since then in many countries of Central Africa. In Cameroon, the requirement to maximize foreign currency income and to increase tax revenues, related to the implementation of the Structural Adjustment Plans from the late 1980s, prompted the State to expand this land-use  (Topa et al. 2009 ). In the northern region of Cameroon for instance, the area of formally leased hunting zones occupied 2.61 million ha in 2011, which was 3.6 times larger than the area in 1968 when hunting zones were first established  (Yasuda 2012) . In Cameroon, there are two main types of sport hunting areas. The hunting Zones (hZ) constitute the first category: according to article No. 92 of the forest Act, they are defined as permanent forest areas of the national domain that are designated as protected areas reserved for professional hunting. They can be exploited by the administration in charge of wildlife but, in most cases, the Cameroon State delegates management to the hunting guides through five-year leases, while (formally) retaining certain functions such as the antipoaching  (Robinson 2008) . Management is regulated by a simple management plan which specifies detailed rules for each leased hunting area  (Egbe 2001 , Mayaka et al. 2005 ). In addition, hunting guides must comply with specifications that include social clauses. The tenants are also required to provide local residents with social amenities (mostly employment) to the extent possible. The second category of sport hunting areas is the Community-Managed hunting Zone (CMhZ). Unlike hZs, which are located in the permanent forest estate, CMhZs extend into both the non-permanent forest estate and in certain categories of the permanent estate like logging concessions  (Vermeulen et al. 2009 ). This concept is not defined in the 1994 forest and Wildlife Law, but resulted from a review of the notion of hunting territories provided for in Decree No. 95/466/PM dated 20 July 1995  (Egbe 2001) . The CMhZ concept appeared during the establishment of the ""Mambele Convention"" in June 1999 and was formally endorsed by  the Ministerial Decree No. 1236 dated 20 September 2000 (Assembe Mvondo 2006 . It is an attempt at community-based conservation to ensure the long-term survival of animal species by involving local people in wildlife management and allowing communities to derive economic benefits from wildlife resources  (Baker 2007) . To that end, local wildlife management committees (Comités de Valorisation des Ressources Fauniques -CoVAREf) were established for the CMhZs. They are first supposed to co-manage CMhZs with the hunting guides selected by the wildlife administration. Secondly, CoVAREfs receive a portion of taxes paid by hunting guides to be used to support local development. Sport hunting is practiced in Cameroon over large contiguous areas that provide an adequate habitat for wildlife populations. In 2013, Cameroon had 71 hZs, CMhZs and co-managed hunting zones (i.e. hZs with greater involvement of the local population) covering some 5 700 000 ha, more than 12% of the national area (DfAP 2013). These different 
 INTRoDUCTIoN Wildlife conservation takes various forms, from exclusionary national parks to community-managed ecosystems. The national park is the oldest model in Central Africa for formally organizing the conservation of nature. The objective of protecting iconic species and landscapes justified the creation of the first national park -the Virunga national park -in 1925 and of most parks throughout the twentieth century in Central Africa  (Devers and Vande weghe 2007) . They were created by the States with little regard to the interests of local communities. Restrictions to customary uses of natural resources were expected to be offset by income from tourism and, more recently, by payments for environmental services. Classic applications of such top-down conservation strategies in Central Africa have been widely contested due to their impact on the social and economic condition of communities and their limited contribution to the protection of natural resources  (Cernea and Schmidt-Soltau 2006, Njiforti and Tchamba 1993) . In the 1980s, Integrated Conservation Development Programmes (ICDPs) were widely adopted to attempt to combine the conservation of biodiversity with community development in protected areas  (Pretty and Smith 2004, Western and Wright 1994) . While positions have varied tremendously, both conservationists and social scientists have criticized ICDPs  (Brandon and Wells 1992, Brechin et al. 2002) , contributing to their declining popularity  (Spiteri and Nepal 2006, Sunderland et al. 2008) . In Central Africa,  Binot and Joiris (2007)  highlighted the challenges faced by these programmes in valuing customary tenure and decisionmaking processes.  Wilkie et al. (2001)  and  Sandker et al. (2009)  emphasized the need for substantial, permanent and long-term funding to support this approach, which is still rare in Central Africa. Community-based natural resources management is also the basis for recent attempts to conserve nature by using traditional ecological knowledge and bring direct benefits to communities  (Balint 2006 , hayes 2006 , Sayer et al. 2005 , Spiteri and Nepal 2006 . Yet in Central Africa, apart from a few successes like the Tayna Nature Reserve in DRC  (Vagheni Kakule 2008) , formal community-based management of natural resources has often resulted in a deterioration of natural capital, as so far shown in the community forests of Cameroon  (Bruggeman et al. 2015 , Cuny et al. 2004 . The negative impacts of local use on forest environments on a local scale have led to disenchantment with communitybased approaches  (hackel 1999 (hackel , Sunderland et al. 2008 . As an alternative to these three strategies for nature conservation, trophy hunting -also known as sport or safari hunting -can also contribute to wildlife protection, but its performance is poorly known in Central Africa  (Lindsey et al. 2007 , Roulet 2004 , Wilkie and Carpenter 1999 . Trophy hunting is run by private operators who lease hunting areas and camps from the State, market and sell hunts to -usually wealthy foreign -clients, and employ local staff to organize safaris. In Central Africa, trophy hunting has been practised since the beginning of the 20 th century, first in association hunting areas are divided into savannah in the northern regions and dense forest areas in the southern provinces  (Table 1 and    figure 1 ). In savannah areas, the species most appreciated by trophy hunters are the bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) and the large antelopes such as the giant eland (Taurotragus derbianus), roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus) and hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus). In the rainforest zone, bongos (Tragelaphus euryceros), forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis), sitatungas (Tragelaphus spekei) or giant hogs (Hylochoerus meinertzhageni) are the major hunted species. Unlike to command-and-control approaches, trophy hunting is an incentive-based and private-led activity for conservation, like payment for environmental services or certification (ferraro and  Kiss 2002) . All these mechanisms are gaining importance in the international debate and, in Central Africa, trophy hunting appears to be the most experimented model of deriving regular income from sustainable use of natural resources. for instance, timber certification started in Cameroon in 2005 and only covers 850 000 hectares in 2015. Similarly, actual initiatives of payment for environmental services remain very limited in Central Africa  (Lescuyer et al. 2009 ). In addition, most national parks were created without direct economic justification and none of them in Central Africa is self-funded through ecotourism or other revenues. The creation of areas dedicated to trophy hunting and the introduction of hunting permits are equivalent to the agency privatizing a space and species that were previously open access resources  (Kiss 1990 , Swanson 1991 . The commodification of certain species and of public lands restricts most local uses, but it provides a financial value to these resources that should allow their sustainable exploitation  (Chardonnet 1995 , Roulet 2007 ). on the one hand, instead of being supported by the local population, the conservation effort is paid for by a small number of rich hunters. on the other hand, sport hunting generates income to remunerate the actors who contribute to the protection of the hunting areas  (Baker 2007 , Robinson 2008 , van der Wal and Djoh 2001  overall, the success of sport hunting for sustainable wildlife management depends on the level of financial benefits drawn by the main three stakeholders: the hunting guides must make an acceptable profit, the State must at least maintain the global tax amount and the local population must procure a significant share of the revenues. Several publications in the 1990s and 2000s  (Baker 2007 , Chardonnet 1995 , Lindsey et al. 2007 , Roulet 2004 , UICN/PACo 2009) reviewed the main benefits of trophy hunting in Central Africa. The purpose of this article is to update the financial assessment of trophy hunting in Cameroon in order to discuss the current and future performance of this incentive-based approach. After a brief presentation of the methods, three financial assessments are provided: (1) the financial costs and revenues of trophy hunting at national level; (2) the planned and current levels of tax revenues; (3) the distribution of revenues among stakeholders. The discussion sums up the financial performance of this model of wildlife management, concluding a few options for revitalizing this approach in Cameroon. 
 METhoDS Existing studies of trophy hunting are fragmented, due to the heterogeneity of practices and of ecological conditions. for instance, several hunting companies are effectively involved in managing wildlife and in anti-poaching activities to try to reduce the level of threat in their areas through adequate skills, staff and resources. other professional guides are mostly interested in leading such a way of life, with a secondary Despite a broad review of existing data on trophy hunting in Cameroon, much information was missing or only partially available to estimate the financial benefits of this activity on a national scale. Several assumptions were therefore made for the calculations. Instead of a long list of hypotheses presented in this section, they are made explicit with the presentation of the results showing how they influenced the estimations. Moreover, most data used for the assessments date from 2012 and 2013, before the negative impacts of the slaughter of elephants at the Bouba N'Djida national park and of the extension of Boko haram in this region are fully felt by professional hunting guides. The situation of the trophy hunting sector in 2015 is probably worse than the description done in the article. 
 RESULTS 
 Evolution of the importance of trophy hunting in the North region since the 1970s After an initial increase between 1968 and 1980 the number of sport hunters visiting the North savanna region has fluctuated between 150 and 250 a year (figure 2). The relatively high numbers in 2010-2014 may be attributed to a shift of hunters no longer able to visit the Central African Republic, because of security reasons. The latest  (2015)  decline suggests that also North Cameroon is increasingly perceived as 'insecure'. Taxes received (hunting zone leasing, hunting license tax and harvesting tax) in the North Region (in €, corrected for inflation) have increased three-fold from the 1970s to the late 2000s (figure 3). however, since the top year 2008, a clear decline has set in, with in 2015 taxes only half the amount of 2008. 
 Financial costs and revenues of trophy hunting areas Revenue from trophy hunting depends on the number of safaris organized in hZs and CMhZs that have been leased to professional guides. however, each year, several hunting zones are not allocated, as shown in  Table 2  for 2012, and remain inactive. There are several safari options that vary according to the length of stay, type of hunted animals, number of hunters, etc. In the absence of precise information on the number and types of safaris sold by professional guides in Cameroon in 2012, an average 12-day safari scenario was assumed, in which one hunter is allowed to shoot two animals of group I and four animals of group II. This ""bag of game"" package is offered by all hunting guides  (Mayaka et al. 2005 , UICN/PACo 2009  and is in the middle of their range of services. for such a safari, the official fee is around € 30 000 in rainforest and € 20 000 in savannah, but these prices are negotiated by the customers and usually decrease by 10%. These amounts are of the same order of magnitude as those proposed by Wilkie interest in running a profitable business, sometimes without the proper tools to correctly exploit their area. At the other end of the spectrum, some guides are more like speculators, not interested in properly managing their hunting zone and abandoning this activity after a few years of detrimental practices. Given the diversity, complexity and opaqueness of this sector, it was not possible to quantify the benefits of the various sport hunting practices. In this study, we conducted a financial analysis for an ""average"" sport hunting activity in Cameroon, which was elaborated with simplistic assumptions on the basis of current economic data. This article used secondary data from scientific publications and technical reports, i.e. Information from the scientific literature was preferred to data from technical reports. When data were different for the same variable, the smallest estimate was used in order to limit the risk of an overstatement of income or cost. A simplified cost-benefit analysis was used to evaluate the financial benefits of trophy hunting in Cameroon. By definition, the financial benefits relate to the revenue streams to the different actors  (Brent 2006) . Inflows are made from sales of safari and of the products associated with this activity. They are gross financial benefits, or turnover. outflows are the actual costs incurred by the actors to obtain financial benefits. The total financial cost aggregates investment, operating and transaction costs. The difference between the gross financial benefit and the financial cost is the net benefit, i.e. the profit that the actors derive from the activity. In contrast with a standard cost-benefit analysis, this assessment covered one year only, without planning the evolution of the sport hunting sector over the medium and long-term. The objective was to evaluate its financial and economic importance on a national scale for one year in order to compare this assessment to macroeconomic aggregates. To do this, the added value of the sector was calculated and Carpenter (1999) and  Roulet (2004) , once updated to 2012. These average prices of safari package are combined to the quantitative data collected for our sample of 10 hunting areas to assess the average turnover of trophy hunting per hectare. To organise hunting safaris, a professional guide who has leased a hunting area faces seven types of costs: · Initial investment to lay out the hunting area, to purchase equipment and to construct buildings, is estimated at $ 200 000 by  Mayaka (2005) . This investment is depreciated over a 10-year period. · The leasing rights vary between € 0.07-0.23/ha/yr with an average of € 0.15/ha/yr for the forest area  (Moaza and Gwet 2007) , and around € 0.1/ha/an in the northern regions (DfAP 2013, Yasuda 2012). · The harvesting tax varies from species to species. Its average value is € 0.1/ha/yr in forest area and € 0.2/ha/yr in savannah (DfAP 2013). In the southeast area, there is also a 10% surcharge paid to communities  (Defo et al. 2010  . · The lessee must also support many other operating expenses related to the reception of clients and to hunting: maintenance of access roads and camp, fuel, maintenance of vehicles, public relations, food, etc. It was not possible to have quantified information on these operational expenses. however, the standard estimate for managing a protected area amounted to € 1.5/ha/yr (UICN/PAPECo 2009). This figure was increased by 10% to update this data and to integrate hZ specific running costs. The figure of € 1.65/ha/yr was used as a proxy to assess the operating costs in hZs and CMhZs. There is no estimate of the informal cost of transactions supported by the professional guide to lease a hunting area, which was therefore not included in the calculation.  Table 3  for the three categories of hunting area. The results are presented initially in € per hectare per year, and then extrapolated to all active hunting areas in 2012 in Cameroon. 
 The assessment of revenues and costs is summarized in The aggregated amount of turnover for sport hunting was found to be around € 7.5 million in 2012. This estimate was 20% lower than those reported by  Roulet (2004)  and  Mayaka (2002) . Net annual profit for professional guides was found to be € -0.76 million, with negative profit rates except for the forest hZs, which differed much from the diagnosis made by  Mayaka et al. (2005)  and  Roulet (2004)  a decade ago. The added value of the sport hunting sector was estimated at € 2.5 million per year, or 0.0001% of Cameroon's GDP (non-oil) for 2013. fIGURE 2 Number of sport hunters in North  Region, Cameroon (1968 -2015  fIGURE 3 Sport hunting taxes (€ inflation corrected till 2012) in the North  Region, Cameroon (1970 -2015    Moreover, since 2012, several factors have tended to further reduce the profitability of trophy hunting in Cameroon. on the one hand, the declining numbers of lions and elephants in hunting areas as well as the recent European Union ban on imports of lion and hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibious) trophies have driven down the price of hunting packages. on the other hand, hunting areas are under increasing pressure from both the expansion of large-scale poaching  (Maisels et al. 2013) , encroachments by rural people to develop agriculture  (Mayaka et al. 2005 (Mayaka et al. , omondi et al. 2008 , and climate of insecurity in the northern part of Cameroon. These threats have probably increased the operational cost involved in managing hunting areas. 
 Actual versus potential tax revenues Two factors reduce the level of tax revenue derived from sport hunting in Cameroon: (1) many hunting areas are not claimed by professional guides; (2) in leased hunting areas, shooting plans are never fully carried out (DfAP 2013). figure 4 compares the maximum tax level, when all hZs and CMhZs are leased and subjected to the payment of the leasing fee and when all shooting programmes are fulfilled and subjected to the harvesting tax, with actual tax revenues. The full application of the sport hunting plan as programmed by the administration, albeit for some species such as lion with unsustainable high numbers till 2015, would lead to an increase in direct tax revenues of about € 1 million per year. 
 Distribution of trophy hunting revenues There are several taxes applicable to sport hunting, but two of them make up the bulk of the payments made by the hunting guides: (1) the right to lease, a fee based on the size of the hZ or CMhZ; (2) the harvesting tax depending on the number and type of animals killed. Part of these taxes and fees is redistributed to communities and councils  (Table 4 ). In addition to direct taxes, there are four other sources of revenue derived from trophy hunting: profit, payroll, indirect taxes and the cash contribution to build local infrastructure. All these revenues are shared among four categories of stakeholder: -The State recovers 50% of hZ leasing rights, of the harvesting tax and of various other taxes related to sport hunting, 20% of payroll in the form of social contributions, and 19.25% of other current expenditure through the value added tax. -Councils are entitled to 40% of the hZ leasing fee; -Local people -composed of communities neighbouring hZs, communities involved in CMhZs and employees of hunting guides -receive 10% of hZ leasing rights, 100% of CMhZ leasing rights, 100% of the harvesting tax surcharge in the forest area, 80% of the payroll, and all social works carried out in the villages; -The lessees of hZs and CMhZs make a profit from this activity. The distribution of revenues from sport hunting among these four stakeholders is shown in  figure 5 . Contrasting earlier publications  (Mayaka et al. 2005 , Wilkie and Carpenter 1999 , Yasuda 2012 ) which ranked hunting guides first, the State has become the main beneficiary of the trophy hunting activity with annual revenues reaching € 1.6 million. This difference is due, on the one hand, to the fact that this estimate integrates general taxation and not only the specific taxation related to sport hunting. on the other hand, the level of profit made by private guides has substantially decreased over the last decade. This distribution of revenues is more favourable to communities than in previous studies as our assessment included local wages and not only reassigned taxes. The wage paid to individual people amounts to 76% of the total amount that communities receive from trophy hunting. however, the total redistributed amount of 0.8 million to local population remains very small with regard to the number of inhabitants neighbouring the hunting areas of Cameroon. 
 DISCUSSIoN Trophy hunting has become a weak incentive-based conservation scheme, which is based on an inefficient business model and on a questionable governance. 
 A declining business model Despite its potential local importance in sparsely-inhabited areas, the trophy hunting industry remains a very minor economic sector on a national level, when judged by its contribution to GDP. Previous assessments by  Mayaka et al. (2005)  fIGURE 4 Planned and actual tax levels on a national scale (€/yr) fIGURE 5 Distribution of revenues accruing from trophy hunting among 4 stakeholders indicated that this activity was profitable for private operators, with a return rate of between 18% and 36%. Updated estimations of the turnover, costs and profit of trophy hunting in Cameroon show that this activity has become unprofitable for many professional guides. With a decreasing level of profit for private operators, the State of Cameroon has become the main beneficiary of sport hunting through the collection of direct and indirect taxes. Nevertheless, hunting tax revenues are far from what was planned by the administration, with a shortfall of € 1 million per year. Local communities have received around € 0.8 million from trophy hunting per year but this amount is not enough to generate local support for this land use, for two reasons. on the one hand, most of these benefits come through individual wages and not through collective institutions which might commit themselves to supporting trophy hunting. on the other hand, hunting-based land-use remains, at least at short term, 200 times less profitable than cotton planting in northern Cameroon  (Mayaka 2002)  and therefore generates substantial opportunity costs for local actors. The overall distribution of trophy hunting revenues is more beneficial to the State and local communities than fifteen years ago, but this condition is not sufficient to guarantee the acceptance of this activity by stakeholders. Today, the weak financial legitimacy of the sport hunting model comes not so much from an inequitable process of income distribution but from a smaller amount of distributed income. Except for the State which keeps collecting direct and indirect taxes, trophy hunting is no longer an incentive-based approach for professional guides nor for communities. The good overall number of hunters still visiting Cameroon (figure 2) should not be interpreted a sign that sport hunting is a healthy business. The declining sport hunting taxes  (2008-2015,    figure 3 ) and the recent abandoning of sport hunting zones are clear signs of the declining performance of the sector. The evolution of sport hunting seems to follow a rent-seeking model where the hunting areas are gradually over-exploited and then abandoned once large animal species have disappeared, as it has been seen in several logging concessions with valuable timber species  (Karsenty 1998 ). 
 An incentive-based approach flawed by the state's failures It is commonplace to compare the incentive-based schemes for biodiversity conservation whose success relies on the economic behaviours of private actors with the commandand-control approaches implemented by the administration. In fact, the success of incentive-based approaches also depends on an appropriate legal framework and governance in which the State plays a major role. Thus, the business model of sport hunting in Cameroon would be more efficient if the State fully assumed three of its prerogatives. firstly, the allocation of hZs and CMhZs to professional guides does not meet minimum conditions of transparency. Unlike the logging sector which underwent a governance reform in the 1990s  (Karsenty 2006 , Topa et al. 2009 ), sport hunting in Cameroon is still characterized by the establishment of accommodating relationships between private operators and representatives of the administration  (Lindsey et al. 2006 , Mayaka et al. 2005 , UICN/PACo 2009 . Secondly, the multiplication of procedures imposed on CoVAREfs since 2009 is contrary to an effective delegation of wildlife management by local populations in the CMhZs  (Defo et al. 2010) . Rather than being dedicated to improving local livelihoods or to managing CMhZ, a significant portion of these funds is spent in operating these CoVAREfs  (Bigombe 2010 , Assembe Mvondo 2006 . The improved performance of these local committees would require a significant simplification of procedures, especially as they apply to small amounts of money. Lastly, the State devotes very few resources to enforcing regulations and monitoring the practices of managers of hunting areas. for instance, management plans, social specifications, or monitoring protocols are almost never drawn up and even less so applied or controlled in the Cameroonian hZs  (Roulet 2004) , although these are legal requirements. In the south-east CMhZs for example, abundance indices for the main species of large mammals were estimated in the early 2000s by  Nzooh et al. (2002) , in 2007 and 2015. Those inventories showed a decline in the population of medium and large mammals in 80% of the south-east CMhZs  (Defo and Tchamba 2012) , although the 2015 survey suggests this decline has stabilized  (Nzooh, pers. comm., 2015) . The only overall wildlife monitoring for the savannah hZ was done by WWf ten years ago, indicating low animal densities  (omondi et al. 2008) . We are aware of only five hZ managers who have commissioned wildlife surveys of their respective zones, and not more than once since 2005. This lack of wildlife monitoring hides the decline in key animal populations (lion, elephant, buffalo, large antelopes) in many sport hunting zones  (Croes et al. 2011 , Scholte 2011 , with off-take quotas being based at best on guesswork, and at worst established to maximize tax revenue or to meet customers' requests  (Lindsey et al. 2007) . The difficulty for the State in enforcing its own rules is not specific to the sport hunting industry. The fight against climate change and the sustainable production of timber face similar obstacles. But in these two sectors, the control of compliance by operators is now exercised by private organizations, like the Verified Carbon Standard for the initiatives of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD) or bureau Veritas and SmartWood for the legality of timber. Several authors have argued for the establishment of a similar process of private certification for sport hunting to ensure the legality and sustainability of practices  (Lindsey et al. 2006 (Lindsey et al. , 2007 . But, unlike other incentive-based schemes for biodiversity conservation, the killing of emblematic animals, as ecologically sustainable as it may be, is little tolerated by a large share of American and European populations  (Brown and Williams 2003) , which would reduce the social acceptability of such a certification process. 
 CoNCLUSIoN -TWo PRoSPECTS foR TRoPhY hUNTING As locally dominant land-use option, sport hunting has shown a declining profitability in Cameroon over the last decade, mainly due to poor governance, external threats and recent insecurity of many hunting areas. With the entire trophy hunting sector internationally under pressure (UICN/PACo 2009) and with growing pressures on rural areas, a pragmatic two tier approach may regain the legitimacy and the performance of this option of sustainable wildlife management. firstly, nowadays several hZs are of limited value due to the scarcity of the species sought by trophy hunters. These hZs should therefore be downgraded and re-allocated to other more realistic land-uses. Trophy hunting would no longer be considered as the dominant purpose of a specialized area but as a secondary objective of a specialized land-use in agriculture, logging or ranching  (Lindsey et al. 2007) . Conversely, many sport hunting zones remain promising and justify the specialization of these areas. The purpose is to strengthen their socio-economic and environmental performance, as well as cater for the payment of other ecosystem services, to better compete with other land-use options. The major challenge is to re-establish the attractiveness of the Cameroonian hZ, notably through the restoration of security in the Northern region. Several technical improvements are also possible through a clarification and an improvement of the State's role in this incentive-based approach. firstly, the transparent, competitive and fair allocation of hZs would refine the relationships between private operators and the administration  (Baker 2007) . Secondly, rather than diluting responsibilities and multiplying procedures, it is for the State to operate a pragmatic devolution of wildlife management to actors. Lastly, the State representatives must be urged to enforce regulation and laws regarding hunting areas, notably for monitoring management and harvesting practices. Beyond merely increasing operational means, the main requirement is to establish incentive schemes in which law enforcement provides more benefits to administrative staff than the current lack of official control.

In addition to the contributions of urban agriculture to urban food security, nutrition, and local economies, farming also affects urban water management, sanitation, and health services  [2] . In that context, urban production of vegetables is increasing rapidly but, in both Africa and Asia, faces many constraints, especially land pressure, access to water, and low soil fertility  [3] [4] [5] . In Benin, West Africa, the same problems have been identified in periurban and urban gardening areas, where irrigated vegetable production developed rapidly after 1990, coinciding with the drastic drop in fish resources in the Atlantic Ocean and in the rivers. The main vegetable crops are leafy vegetables, eggplant (Solanum macrocarpon L.), carrots (Daucus carota L.), tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.), peppers (Capsicum frutescens), and onions (Allium cepa). To satisfy the increasing demand for vegetables, despite the poverty of coastal soils and land pressure, farmers tend to intensify production by using mineral and organic fertilizers and pesticides. Today, animal manure (60% poultry manure and 40% cattle manure) is frequently used as fertilizer in the study area, Grand-Popo in Benin. Animal manures have been used as effective fertilizers for centuries  [6, 7] . Brooks et al.  [8]  investigated potential microbial runoff associated with the application of poultry litter on the soil. Several other studies pointed to pollution and health risks caused by lack of knowledge and bad practices in the management of livestock manure and chemical fertilizers  [1, 3, 9] . Excessive use of fertilizer at each agricultural campaign has been reported in both Africa and Asia, particularly the 2 International Journal of Food Science use of poultry manure at rates of 20 to 50 t⋅ha −1 and the use of mineral fertilizers, such as urea and NPK  (10-20-20  nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizer), at rates of 1.2 to 2 t⋅ha −1  [6, 9] . Unfortunately, the intensive use of organic matter like cow dung and poultry manure and other animal feces are a significant environmental risk to soils, waters, and crops, including fecal contamination  [6] . Many infection outbreaks have been associated with water or food directly or indirectly contaminated by animal manure  [10, 11]  by identifying Escherichia coli and fecal coliforms, which are indicators of fecal pollution  [12, 13] . One such example was a major waterborne outbreak of Escherichia coli O157:H7 (ECO157) infections with bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps which lasted from 15 December 1989 to 20 January 1990 in Missouri  [14] . Griffin et al.  [15]  reported the occurrence of many outbreaks of Escherichia coli O157:H7 (ECO157) infections in communities, nursing homes, a day care center, and a kindergarten. They mainly took the form of gastrointestinal diseases, bloody diarrhea, hemolytic uremic syndrome, or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Contaminated manure can contact the product directly when used as a soil fertilizer or indirectly via infiltration of irrigation water or infiltration of water used to wash the product. Ibenyassine et al.  [16]  and Steele et al.  [17]  reported that contaminated irrigation water and surface runoff water may be major sources of pathogenic microorganisms that contaminate fruits and vegetables in fields. Animal feces including poultry manure which contain large numbers of bacteria can contaminate croplands and hence agricultural products. Fecal bacteria, including Escherichia coli, are responsible for serious outbreaks of diarrhea, particularly in children. Some of these microorganisms, including fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, and fecal streptococci, are lifethreatening. Gastrointestinal diseases are ranked as the second most important health problem after malaria for most communities in Accra, Ghana, especially in high-density, low-income areas. Elderly and immune-depressed patients are also exposed to the risk of gastrointestinal problems. Other infectious diseases including hepatitis, typhoid and paratyphoid fever, meningitis, and skin diseases can also be caused by fecal contamination  [18] [19] [20] . According to the literature, few studies have dealt with the link between the presence of pathogens in freshly harvested vegetables and the wide use of organic material such as poultry manure as fertilizer in market gardening in tropical developing countries  [1, 21] . One risk of the intensive use of such organic waste is fecal contamination of the vegetables  [3] . Today, poor practices used for the management of livestock manure and chemical fertilizers remain the same as those reported in 2009-2010, since the farmers in the study area have not adopted alternative practices. In the present study, this issue was addressed by assessing the microbiological quality of vegetables cultivated in market gardening areas in the coastal area of southern Benin. Lifethreatening pathogens (fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, and fecal streptococci) were counted both in the poultry manure and in the fresh vegetables after harvest. Both irrigation water and the cultivated soil were analyzed. The main reason why this study focuses on fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, and fecal streptococci is that Escherichia coli is an ideal indicator of hygiene in microbiological analyses of raw foods like fresh vegetables. The origin of these fecal pathogens was identified with the aim of recommending ways to reduce these risks. The climate is subequatorial characterized by little variation in temperature (annual average: 27.4 ∘ C) and a bimodal rainfall pattern (annual average rainfall: 882 mm). Marine sandy soils, very seeping and porous, make up the two first soils layers (0-18 cm and 18-40 cm) with slightly basic pH between 7.3 and 7.5  [6]  at the two sites. The land has been cultivated continuously for several decades without fallow. 
 Materials and Methods Farmers have easy access to groundwater for crop irrigation (through spraying water method) but are limited by the low fertility of the coastal sandy soils. To satisfy growing urban demand and to improve crop productivity, they have adopted intensive practices, such as application of chemical fertilizers combined with high rates of poultry manure, which is available locally. The length of the crop cycle of these vegetables varies from 1.5 to 3.5 months enabling farmers to successively cultivate four vegetable crops per year. 
 Experimental Design. At each site, the experiment was conducted in a split-plot design with two factors (4 fertilization treatments and 3 vegetable crops) and three replications during four successive vegetable growing periods. Each plot measured 2 m 2 (2 m × 1 m). The four growing periods were from 5 May 2009 to 2 September 2009 (period 1) during the long rainy season, from 10 September 2009 to 12 January 2010 (period 2) during the short rainy season and the long dry season, from 20 January 2010 to 13 May 2010 (period 3) during the dry season and the long rainy season, and from 21 May 2010 to 15 August 2010 (period 4) during the long rainy season and the short dry season. The main factor analyzed was fertilization including the chemical fertilizers and poultry manure applied during each growing period, using four different treatments (  Table 1 ). The poultry manure was composed of chicken feces and wood shavings and came from a local chicken farm. The second factor was the vegetable crop: tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum M.), traditional eggplant (Solanum macrocarpon L.), or carrot (Daucus carota L.). The vegetables were harvested the same day and only once. 
 Sampling and Analyses. A total of 164 samples from the two sites were analyzed during the study. At harvest time, for each plot and each crop, five individual samples collected from the four corners of the plot and one sample from the middle were pooled to make a composite 100 g sample of fresh One kg of poultry manure was collected using the procedure described above. All samples of poultry manure were immediately sealed in sterile bags at 25 ∘ C and transported to the laboratory. Analyses of the different samples (poultry manure and vegetables) were performed by the ""Water and Food Quality Control Laboratory of the Ministry of Health"" in Cotonou. At the time, this laboratory was the only one in Cotonou to perform microbiological analyses of both liquid and solid foods. During the study period, a second laboratory, which was only qualified for microbiology analyses in water, had problems with its specific equipment. But as soils and poultry manure are solid and the target of the present study was fecal pathogens, samples of soils and poultry manures were also sent to that qualified laboratory. In the absence of evidence from other organizations (FAO, CEE, and IRD) or other European recommendations that mention levels of fecal pathogens recorded in soils and manure, AFNOR food and water criteria are used in the paper. To our knowledge, the purpose of the AFNOR criteria is to identify the concentration of these pathogens in the substances like vegetables or water, consumed by human beings. For this reason, we compare our data concerning soils and poultry manure with AFNOR criteria and analytical techniques. The number of fecal microorganisms per gram of composite sample of fresh vegetables or of poultry manure or of soils was used as the unit of measure. 
 Data Analysis. Analysis of variance on repeated measures  [22]  was performed to test the effects of ""growing period,"" ""fertilization treatment,"" ""vegetable crop,"" and ""site"" on the populations of microorganisms of soils, while traditional analysis of variance (nonrepeated measures) was performed to test the effects of the above-cited factors (except ""growing period"") on the populations of fecal microorganisms on the vegetables. In the two models, site was considered as random factor, while the other factors were fixed. These statistical analyses were conducted using SAS software version 9.2. To stabilize the variances, each of the three variables (fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, and fecal streptococci) was logtransformed according to the following relation: = ln( +1), where is the number of bacteria observed for each variable and is the result of the transformation. The adjusted means of the three variables were compiled with the corresponding coefficients of variation. Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) tests distinguished means by highlighting the different groups of homogenous treatments. Factors able to explain the variability of the number of fecal bacteria in the study area were identified. of fecal coliforms by more than half (growing period 2 to growing period 3). A similar situation was observed for Escherichia coli in irrigation water and soils at both sites, but here we rather witnessed their disappearance from period 1 (harvest period) to period 3. However, concerning the poultry manure, the untimely actions of the driving rain during the trial could explain the variations that occurred in period 4 when the poultry manure was stored outside the henhouse for two months (from April 2010 to May 2010). Rainfall amounted to 147 mm in eight days from 1 April 2010 to 12 April 2010 versus 16 days for the same volume during the same period in 2009. Driving rains could thus also have been responsible for the reduction in (or the absence of) microorganisms at some dates, in particular Escherichia coli and fecal streptococci in the poultry manure taken from the henhouse on 10 April 2010 and analyzed on 13 May 2010. This observation is in accordance with the results of Hutchison et al.  [23] , who contrasted the effect of driving rain on the survival of fecal coliforms, causing their destruction and washing them out, with the effect of drizzle. Like Jamieson et al.  [24] , our results showed that bacterial survival was optimal in cold wet conditions. But it is possible that competition among microorganisms also affects the survival of fecal bacteria in the soil, in line with the influence of predation  [25] . In the study area, predation among bacteria could also be responsible for the disappearance of fecal pathogens. Based on the results observed through  Figure 1 , it is possible to conclude that, because there was no organic matter in the soil, as soon as the poultry manure was applied to the soil, the fecal microorganisms remained on the surface and moved directly towards the vegetables. Franz et al.  [26]  reported that survival of Escherichia coli was optimal in soils rich in organic matter and under flooding. According to these authors, water holding capacity, which depends on soil texture and organic matter content, is known to have an impact on fecal bacteria. Analyses of poultry manure in growing period 4 (the wettest period) revealed the influence of humidity. As soils with a high humus ratio have the highest water holding capacity, they provide a favorable environment for the survival of fecal pathogens. In conclusion, in this study area, a large proportion of the fecal bacteria supplied by the poultry manure did not survive due to unfavorable abiotic conditions (temperature, pH, and organic matter content). 
 Results and Discussion 
 Changes in Populations of Fecal Bacteria in the Poultry 
 High Level of Contamination of Harvested Vegetables. Individually, site, fertilization treatment, and type of vegetable had no significant effect on the number of fecal microorganisms  (Figures 2(a), 2(b), and 2(c) ). Log-transformed fecal coliform counts on vegetables were close to 10, that is, higher than those of Escherichia coli and fecal streptococci (each close to six)  (Figure 3 ). The number of populations of microorganisms varied considerably among the four growing periods and among the three vegetables crops  (Figures 2(a) , 2(b), and 2(c)). From 5 May 2009 to 13 May 2010 (three successive growing periods), fecal coliforms increased four times on carrot (2.8 to 10.7) and almost two times on eggplant (4.8 to 8.5). In the same periods, fecal coliforms on tomato increased almost four times (from 2.3 to 8.6) but decreased by half on both vegetables in period 4  (Figures 2(a), 2(b) , and 2(c)). On tomato  (Figure 2(c) ), fecal coliforms increased from two in period 1 to nine in period 3 before decreasing to four in period 4. The highest rate of contamination by fecal coliforms (<11) on carrot and by Escherichia coli on eggplant (7) occurred in period 3 and in period 2 on carrot (<9). The number of fecal coliforms on the vegetables reached its peak in periods 2 and 3, whereas the number of Escherichia coli  (7)  was highest in period 3 and that of fecal streptococci (>8) was highest in period 2. Fecal coliforms were lowest (around 2) in period 1. Escherichia coli were absent during some growing periods and fecal streptococci were absent in period 4  (Figure 2(b) ). In the vegetable samples, the mean number of fecal bacteria per gram was considerably higher than the levels recommended by the French Standards Association  [27]  for fresh vegetables (  Table 2 ): 8 to 10 times higher than the standard for fecal coliforms, 2 to 6 times higher than the standard for Escherichia coli, and 5 to 8 times higher than the standard for fecal streptococci. Although the original source of contamination of produce has seldom been identified, manure from farm animals has long been suspected of being a leading vehicle of pathogen transmission. Concerning the different results and the fact that the major source of contamination of fresh products is microbial pathogens, we agree with Ijabadeniyi et al.  [11]  who reported that, at the preharvest stage, the sources include feces, irrigation water, inadequately composted manure, soil, air, animals, and human handling. 
 Role of Poultry Manure in the Contamination of Vegetables. Considering all the treatments (T0, T1, T2, and T3) together, we found all three types of fecal bacteria in the three vegetable crops  (Figures 2(a), 2(b) , and 2(c)). As shown by the results of the analyses of variance  (Table 3)     the growing period had a significant effect (probability 0.1%) on the concentrations of the three fecal bacteria analyzed. The application of fertilizer had no significant impact on the high initial contamination of the environment. For instance, the control treatment (T0), that is, no poultry manure, resulted in as high level of fecal coliforms as treatments T1 (mineral fertilizer), T2 (mineral fertilizer + poultry manure), and T3 (manure only), on all three vegetables (  Figure 4) . We recorded log-transformed average counts of eight for fecal coliforms in the plots with the control treatment T0, six for Escherichia coli, and three for fecal streptococci. On the other hand, treatments T2 and T3 tended to result in more fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci in all the growing periods. This tendency was most marked in period 2 in the short rainy season and in period 3 during the long dry season  (Figures 1, 2(a), 2(b) , and 2(c)). The control treatment (T0), under which no poultry manure was applied, resulted in the same high concentration of fecal microorganisms in all three vegetables as treatments T1, T2, and T3. This is likely due to the untimely actions of the flow of irrigation water and rain on the plots under control treatment T0. The long traditional use of poultry manure which probably left fecal bacteria in the soil and water in  the study area before the beginning of the trials is another probable explanation. On the other hand, the lower number of Escherichia coli in all three vegetables with treatment T3 confirmed that contamination was recent. Even though three months passed between application of the fertilizer and harvest, it is highly probable that Escherichia coli we counted came from the applied poultry manure. So, in the case of Grand-Popo, both traditional organic fertilizers (poultry manure and cow dung) and the poultry manure supplied during the trial can be assumed to be responsible for the contamination. Our results are in agreement with those of Amponsah-Doku et al.  [9] , who reported that poultry manure, which is the main fertilizer used by 75% of lettuce growers in Accra and Kumasi (Ghana), was responsible for the contamination of the lettuce by numerous fecal coliforms. Urban areas can also be sources of fecal pollution: storm waters can transport fecal organisms in runoff originating from domestic waste, urban wildlife, or domestic animals. The many heaps of wastes observed in the villages of Ayi-Guinnou and Yodo-Condji and the liquid wastes deposited in the environment along with vegetable leftovers were possible sources of contamination. Moreover, for more than 70% of the local population, river banks and the beach are defecation areas with deleterious consequences for the microbiological quality of the irrigation water, which is also used as drinking water by the local population  [1, 28] . 
 Conclusion Application of contaminated poultry manure to the crops in gardening sites may result in contamination of vegetables by the following fecal bacteria: fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, and fecal streptococci. Our study has demonstrated that the use of poultry manure as fertilizer during the agronomic trials has influenced the fecal bacteria counts recorded on the vegetables. The long traditional use of poultry manure which probably left fecal bacteria in the soil and water in the study area before the beginning of the trials is another probable explanation. This statement of the environment constitutes a genuine danger for the public health: that of the farmers, local populations, and the consumers of the vegetables produced in the area. The combination of market gardening and livestock rising is widely considered to be a good way to increase plant yields. But our results show that it can also have negative impacts on human health. For this reason, to achieve sustainable urban agriculture in Africa, those designing innovative cropping systems need to be mindful of the environment and of public health concerns and such systems should be developed through multidisciplinary research that includes more medical, biological, environmental, and socioeconomic components. But, in the immediate future, the use of properly composted poultry manure should help reduce the number and range of pathogens and hence avoid the application of contaminated manure. 2. 1 . 1 Study Area.

 (i) Vegetables and Poultry Manure. Note the following:(a) Fecal coliforms per g were identified by colimetry using the V-08-60 Rapid'E. coli medium (24 h at 44 ∘ C). (b) Escherichia coli per g were identified by colimetry using the V-08-053 Rapid'E. coli medium (24 h at 44 ∘ C). (c) Fecal streptococci were identified by NFT 90416 and Bartley and Slanetz medium (24 h-48 h at 37 ∘ C). 
 Figure 1 : 1 Manure as a Function of the Growing Period. High temporal variability of the number of fecal bacteria in the poultry manure at the two sites was observed (Figure 1). Log-transformed fecal coliform counts increased from 5 May 2009 to 2 September 2009 (period 1) and from 10 September 2009 to 12 January 2010 (period 2). Conversely, log-transformed counts of Escherichia coli decreased from 4 in period 1 to slightly less than 4 in period 2 and were absent from 20 January 2010 to 13 May 2010 (period 3) and from 21 May 2010 to 15 August 2010 (period 4). The number of streptococci decreased from more than 6 in period 1 to slightly less than 6 in period 2 and then increased to 8 in period 3 before falling to slightly less than 4 in period 4.The high temperatures (30 ∘ C to 35 ∘ C) between December 2009 and January 2010 when the poultry manure was stored outside the henhouse probably helped reduce Changes in populations of the three fecal microorganisms in poultry manure over the four growing periods (coastal area of Benin, 2009-2010).

These improved properties result from the wood cell polymers' chemical modifications occurring during treatment  (Esteves et al. 2013) , which confer the new wood properties  (Tjeerdma and Militz 2005) . Previous studies have shown that the wood thermal degradation mass loss is a good indicator for the treatment intensity directly related to the temperature and the duration of the heat treatment  (Welzbacher et al. 2007 , Pétrissans et al. 2014 . Elemental wood composition has been reported as a good marker of treatment intensity and consequently of the mass loss level, allowing further prediction of the heat treated wood decay resistance  (Nguila et al. 2009 ). According to previous experiments, mass losses between 10 and 14% are generally required to reach a weight loss against fungal attacks lower than 3%. The decay resistance of the treated wood matches to a full durability  (Chaouch et al. 2010) , according to the European Standard EN 113/A1  (2004) . In parallel with improvement of wood durability, mechanical properties were generally significantly weakened  (Bengtsson et al. 2002) . The wood properties' modifications are directly correlated to the treatment intensity  (Chaouch et al. 2010 , Gunduz et al. 2009 ). Nowadays, the main concern is the difficulty to produce in an industrial scale heat treated wood with constant and controlled final wood product quality (durability, dimensional stability, color). Most of thermal treatment processes are performed by convection and don't record the wood mass loss during the process  (Abibois 2012) . Moreover, heat transfer by convection may give rise to an unsatisfactory treatment homogeneity on the set of treated samples  (Pétrissans et al. 2007) . So, it is necessary to elaborate some parameters to estimate the mass loss, resulting from treatment intensity, the new properties of heat treated wood, and which could be easily used for industrial process. In this study, heat treatment was performed by conduction to obtain a better thermal homogeneity. Wood mass loss was recorded during the thermal degradation. Curing was carried out under vacuum. The global treatment duration by comparison with a process using a nitrogen atmosphere  (Candelier et al. 2013a ) is reduced, because re-condensation and thermal reticulation of wood degradation products are avoided. The aim of this study is to investigate the relations between the heat treatment intensity and the thermal degradation kinetics, mass losses and the final properties conferred to the heat treated wood. The relative area of treatment temperature curves is proposed as an indicator of heat treatment. This area represents the amount of the heat absorbed by the treated wood samples. Heat treatments with various intensities (temperature-time) have been performed on four wood species in order to obtain thermal degradation mass loses of 8, 10 and 12%. For each treatment, relative areas, masse losses, decay resistance and mechanical properties have been determined and correlated. 
 MATERIAL AND METHODS 
 Wood sample and heat treatment protocol Each heat treatment was carried out simultaneously on two wood boards of 250 x 25 x 110 mm 3 (L x R x T). Four wood species have been studied, one hardwood; Zeen oak (Quercus canariensis) and three softwoods; Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), Radiata pine (Pinus radiata), Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster). Thermal treatment was performed in a 0,25 cubic meter laboratory autoclave by conduction between two electric heated metallic plates equipped to record dynamic mass loss and temperature (SEIR, Charmes France). Each board was initially dried at 103 °C for 48 h and placed in the oven. The oven was then closed and placed under vacuum (200 mbar). The plate temperature was slowly increased by 0,3 °C.min -1 from ambient to the drying temperature (103°C) until complete stabilization of the boards' mass. After this period, the plate's temperature was increased by 0,3 °C.min -1 from 103 °C to 170 °C and the temperature maintained for 2 h. The temperature was then increased by 0,2 °C.min -1 from 170 to 220 °C to perform wood thermal modification to different mass losses of 8, 10 and 12% (  Figure 1 ). The heating system was then stopped and wood samples cooled down to room temperature under an oxygen free atmosphere.  
 Relative area determination The heat treatment device allows dynamic recording of wood temperature and wood mass loss curves. Relative area was calculated between the end of the drying step at 105oC (m0) and the process of cooling down to 105°C (  Figure 2 ). The relative area was calculated during the effective thermal modification step for each heat treatment and each wood species. The temperature curves are obtained by averaging both simultaneously treated wood boards. The relative area represents the quantity of the effective heat power exchanged during the treatment process leading to a required wood mass loss. Relative area takes into account on one hand the capacitive thermal power transferred by conduction in the oven, and on the other hand to the reaction enthalpy due to the exothermic character of the thermodegradation reactions.

 Decay resistance Blocks of 25 x 10 x 5 mm 3 in longitudinal, radial and tangential directions were cut from heat treated and untreated wood and dried at 103 °C for 48 h (m 1 ). Petri dishes (90 mm diameter) were filled with sterile culture medium prepared by mixing 30 g malt and 40 g agar in one L of distilled water, inoculated with the different fungi and incubated at 22 °C and 70% relative humidity to allow full colonization of the surface by the mycelium. The decay resistance was tested on four different fungies: Coriolus versicolor (CV), Gloeophyllum trabeum (GT), Coniophora puteana (CP) and Poria placenta (PP). Three blocks (2 treated and one untreated as control) were placed in each Petri dish and incubated during 16 weeks to evaluate the effect of thermal modification. Each experiment was triplicated. After this period, mycelia were removed and the blocks were dried at 103 °C and weighed (m2) to determine the weight loss caused by the fungal attack. (1) 
 Mechanical properties In order to assess the effect of heat-treatment parameters on the mechanical properties, three point bending (MOE, MOR) and Brinell hardness were carried out for untreated and heat treated samples, results are compared. An INSTRON 4467 Universal Mechanical Test Machine was used for the measurements. Samples were conditioned in a room with 65% RH and 22 °C during the time necessary to stabilize the samples weights. Three point static bending tests were carried out according to the EN 408  (2003) . The sample size was 200 x 10 m x 10 mm 3 (L x R x T). The moving head speed and the span length were 1,8 mm.s -1 and 160 mm, respectively. The load deformation data obtained were analyzed to determine the modulus of elasticity (MOE) and the modulus of rupture (MOR). Tests were replicated twenty times for each treatment condition, 10 samples were used for each heat treated boards. Brinell hardness tests were performed according to the EN 408 (2003) standard. The force was applied by a sphere with a diameter of 10 mm. This force is applied in three steps. It was slowly increased by 0,2 kN.s -1 during 15 s. After this period, a force of 3 kN was maintained for 25 s and finally the applied force was decreased. Brinell hardness tests were replicated twenty times (10 tests for each wood boards). Every test was separated by at least 30 mm from the edge of the boards and 25 mm between each test. Accuracy of the measurement of the ball penetration depth was 0,01 mm and the applied force's one was 0,005 kN.  Figure 3  gives the relations between the relative area and wood samples mass losses issued from the thermal degradation obtained for a given treatment intensity. For all wood species, heat treatment was performed at 220°C. The difference between treatment intensities is determined by process duration. Treatment time will then determine the wood mass loss. Relative areas are representative to the treatment intensity. For a given mass loss, the relative area is determined as shown on figure 2. The relative area corresponding to the kinetics of Zeen oak wood thermal degradation was found less important compared to the three others softwood species. These results are in agreement with previous studies  (Candelier et al. 2011 ) that have showed the higher sensitivity to thermal degradation of hardwood than softwood. The thermal susceptibility differences between hardwood and softwood species are more pronounced for mass loss higher than 8%. Similar result have been found by  Chaouch et al. (2010)  in a study of the correlation between mass loss and treatment intensity (time and temperature) during the heat treatment of several wood species such as silver fir, pine, beech, poplar and ash. The main difference concerns the thermal degradation kinetics, which is directly influenced by the treatment temperature  (Candelier et al. 2011 ) and the quantity of acetic acid liberated during the heat treatment  (Stamm 1956 ). The acetic acid production strongly depends on the wood species nature: hardwoods lead to higher amounts of acid compared to softwoods. This may be related to the nature of hemicelluloses initially present in hardwood and softwood species  (Sjöström 1981, Fengel and Wegener 1989) . 
 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 Relative area and treatment intensity The observed in these work relations between the process heat energy characterized by the relative area and the occurring wood mass loss show a good agreement with a previous study based on a thermal-gravimetric device coupled with DSC analysis system  (Candelier et al. 2013b ). 
 Prediction of decay resistance Durability of untreated and heat wood were investigated with various brown rot and white rot fungi. Similar results are obtained for each fungus: Coriolus versicolor (CV), Gloeophyllum trabeum (GT), Coniophora puteana (CP) and Poria placenta (PP). Higher weight loss was caused by Poria placenta, results are presented on the figure 4. After a 16 weeks fungal exposure, all heat treated samples show an improved decay durability revealed by the measured reduced weight losses, while untreated samples were strongly degraded. Softwood species' weight losses are greater than 22% according to the used fungal species. Zeen oak wood exhibits a higher natural durability, however thermal treatment improves further its decay resistance. According to the determination coefficients (R 2 ) values comprised between 0,95 and 0,99, the relative area seems to be a good parameter to predict final durability of the studied wood species. Moreover, whatever is the studied wood species, when a mass loss of 12 % is reached, the decay resistance is improved to confer a durability class 3. Similar results have been found by  Chaouch et al. (2010)  indicating that treatment intensity represented by mass loss comprised between 10 and 12 % improves significantly the decay resistance of several hardwood and softwood species. 
 Evaluation of mechanical properties Whatever is the wood species nature, mechanical properties are modified by the thermal treatment. Results indicate that, modulus of elasticity (MOE) is less affected after heat treatment comparatively to the modulus of rupture (MOR), while Brinell hardness is only slightly affected. Similar results have been fund by  (Yildiz et al. 2006) . Moreover, the decrease of these three mechanical properties seems to be correlated to the relative areas introducing the treatment intensity (  Figures 5-7) .   Previous studies have indicated that MOE and MOR in Bending strength decrease as a function of the increased treatment severity  (Mburu et al. 2008 ). In addition, the influence of heat treatment on different strength properties is not proportional  (Boonstra et al. 2007) . These mechanical modifications depend on the wood species nature  (Arnold 2010)  but also on the natural defects, such as knots, resin pockets. Wood strength properties appeared to be affected by the heat treatment  (Boonstra et al. 2007 ). These observations may explain the scatter of results and consequently the lower value of the determination coefficients (0,60 < R 2 < 0,98,  Figures 5-6 ). Concerning Brinell hardness properties, Hardness decreases as a function of the increased treatment intensity  (Unsal et al. 2003)  and the influence of the wood nature on this hardness weakening is more pronounced  (Figure 7) . Results indicate that treatment severity causes higher hardness degradation on the zeen oak than the other softwood species. Indeed, although zeen oak wood had the highest hardness value for control samples, its hardness reduction was also larger than for any other species considered in this work. Similar results have been found through previous studies  (Priadia and Hiziroglub 2013) . They found also that, in the oak wood, hardness is more degraded by the heat treatment intensity than in other wood species as mindi, mahogany and pine woods. Extreme porous structure along with high extractive amount of oak would be considered for such findings. Additionally, SEM microscopic analyses  (Priadia and Hiziroglub 2013)  have shown that in the heat treated oak wood there are more cracks and distorted parts than in the heat treated pine. That observation can explain the higher oak wood hardness sensibility to thermal degradation compared to other species. Further studies on the relative areas could provide additional information for industrial applications giving recommendation about the heat treatment cycle consumptions, necessary for treat thermally a considered wood species to obtain desired quality of the final material. 
 CONCLUSION Relative area representative to heat treatment intensity seems to be a good indicator to predict wood mass loss due to the thermal degradation. This parameter can be used also to estimate the final product quality. Indeed, relative area appears to be a good means to predict the durability improvement after a thermal modification of wood using a conduction process. In spite of less important correlation coefficients, mechanical properties seem to be related to the relative areas. Heat treated woods presents lower MOR and MOE in bending and lower Brinell hardness comparatively to control wood samples. Between the three investigated mechanical properties, MOR was the most sensitive property to the heat treatment conditions. However, reduction of these properties seems to be correlated with the relative area. Finally, the utilization of the relative area, as indicator of decay resistance and mechanical properties of heat treated wood, could be investigated for other industrial wood thermal modification processes such as Thermowood ® . While similar correlations as these found in our study could be transposed to other industrial convection processes. The relative area could be a means to control and predict heat-treated wood quality.

The Fourth and Fifth Assessment Reports of the IPCC have dedicated sections on synergies and trade-offs between mitigation and adaptation,  6, 7  and the interest in the links between the two strategies (particularly evident in landscape management) has been growing since the Fourth Assessment. A landscape is a spatially heterogeneous land area that encompasses a mosaic of interacting ecosystems and includes cultural and institutional attributes.  8  Activities within the different land uses in the landscape (such as agricultural and forest management) affect and depend on the spatial and socioeconomic interactions among people and natural resources.  9  The management of agriculture and forests in a landscape can contribute to mitigation by storing carbon, reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, or reducing non-CO 2 emissions from agriculture. Landscape management can also help people adapt to climate variations: 10 e.g., adequate agricultural management enhances food security, forests regulate the microclimate locally (in cities) and water regionally (in watersheds), and mangroves buffer the impacts of extreme climate events in coastal areas. In addition, adaptation measures can be implemented to reduce the vulnerability of agriculture and forestry to climate change.  11  Landscape management can thus be an effective response to climate change and new approaches such as climate-smart landscapes, agriculture or forestry have been proposed  [12] [13] [14]    (Figure 1 ). However, trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation can occur (e.g., when gains in carbon sequestration lead to an increase in the vulnerability of people or ecosystems). Adaptation and mitigation policy instruments consider activities related to landscape management. The clean development mechanism includes agricultural projects and reforestation or afforestation for their contribution to mitigation, while the REDD+ instrument (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) aims to reduce carbon losses from forest degradation and deforestation (often caused by agriculture expansion), and to conserve or enhance carbon stocks through sustainable forest management. The Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions policies also include actions related to agriculture and deforestation in different countries.  15  Agriculture is a priority sector in many adaptation activities and the ecosystem-based approach to adaptation considers the role of ecosystem services in reducing vulnerability-an approach strongly connected to landscape management. Such projects can be found in the National Adaptation Programmes of Action in a number of African and Asian countries.  16  Early studies on the links between adaptation and mitigation have explored optimal mixes of adaptation and mitigation, which have been considered by some as substitutes at the global scale; for example a larger global effort on mitigation would require a smaller effort on adaptation because of reduced climate impacts.  17, 18  In this case, the best possible combination of adaptation and mitigation strategies comes from optimization analysis. Synergies is an alternative, more recent idea.  19  It is based on the assumption that adaptation and mitigation actions can interact 'so that their combined effect is greater than the sum of their effects if implemented separately' 7 (p. 749). Some authors have suggested that integrating adaptation and mitigation objectives limits unwanted negatives consequences, e.g., the potential negative consequences of REDD+ projects on the adaptation of people and ecosystems.  20  Following the framework proposed in  Figure 1 , we define the integration of adaptation and mitigation   C  li  m  a  te   Im  p  a  c  ts   Im  p  a  c  ts  c h a n g e FIGURE 1 | Conceptual framework of the integration of adaptation and mitigation into landscape management. Landscapes deliver services that in landscape management as the design and implementation of management practices that deliver the three outcomes of climate-smart landscapes (societal adaptation, ecological adaptation, and climate mitigation) and recognize and minimize the trade-offs between these outcomes. Landscape management presents many opportunities for integrating adaptation and mitigation simultaneously,  21, 22  but few initiatives have harnessed them.  7  One of the barriers for broader implementation of integrated adaptation and mitigation strategies is the lack of information on how adaptation can benefit mitigation (and vice versa) in landscape management, what added values integrated strategies bring, under what context they should be pursued, and whether mitigation and adaptation should be mainstreamed separately or jointly into land-use policies.  5  Here we present the results of a systematic review of scientific literature of climate change projects, measures and policies, where we explored the opportunities and trade-offs of managing landscapes for both climate change mitigation and adaptation. We first present the approach of the review and we then describe and illustrate the three different conceptualizations of the links between adaptation and mitigation that we found in the literature. We finally explore the policy implications of these conceptualizations. 
 REVIEW APPROACH We searched for journal articles in English in the databases ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, Science direct and JSTOR, with three groups of keywords linked with the AND operator. The groups referred to landscape management (e.g., keywords such as forest, agriculture, ecosystem, watershed), mitigation (e.g., keywords such as carbon sequestration, REDD, greenhouse gas), and adaptation (e.g., keywords such as vulnerability, resilience, risk reduction). We used the OR operator within each group to differentiate between keywords (see Appendix S1, Supplementary Information for the detailed protocol for searching papers, filtering results, and extracting data). The search we conducted in June 2013 resulted in 3486 references after removing duplicates and selecting only recent papers (published between 2000 and June 2013). We screened the references and kept only the 142 articles that dealt with all three themes: climate change mitigation, adaptation to climate variations, and landscape management (including management of different land uses and land-related activities such as forestry, agriculture, and livestock management). We identified 274 cases in the analyzed papers. (A case is defined here a statement about the links between adaptation and mitigation.) For each case, we recorded the type of intervention considered (e.g., ecological restoration), the main objective(s) of the intervention (i.e., mitigation, adaptation, or other objectives), its outcomes on different climate objectives and how these outcomes were justified. We examined the way the links between adaptation and mitigation were conceptualized in each case and we developed a typology of conceptualizations. 
 DIFFERENT CONCEPTUALIZATIONS OF THE LINKS BETWEEN ADAPTATION AND MITIGATION In the reviewed literature, we found that the links between adaptation and mitigation were viewed in three different ways, which we named joint outcomes, unintended side effects, and joint objectives (  Figure 2 ). Some articles analyzed the delivery of joint adaptation and mitigation outcomes by activities that had no primary climatic objectives. Other articles showed that, even when activities aimed at only one climate objective (either adaptation or mitigation), they could produce an outcome for the other objective (unintended side effects): a 'service' in the case of positive outcome or a 'disservice' in the opposite case. Some articles described the possible effects of considering adaptation and mitigation objectives jointly. For example, adding adaptation objectives to a mitigation project could strengthen its mitigation outcomes or weaken it. In some cases, associating adaptation and mitigation Outcomes FIGURE 2 | Three main conceptualizations of the relationships between adaptation and mitigation. (a) Joint outcomes (activities with nonclimatic primary objectives deliver joint adaptation and mitigation outcomes); (b) Unintended side effects (activities aimed at only one climate objective-either adaptation or mitigation-also deliver outcomes for the other objective); (c) Joint objectives (associating both adaptation and mitigation objectives leads to interactions that strengthen or weaken outcomes). could lead to worse outcomes for both objectives (competition) or better ones (synergy) (  Table 1) . The three conceptualizations were used in 43, 33, and 24% of the reviewed cases, respectively. In the second conceptualization ('unintended side effects'), there were more cases on services (20%) than disservices (13%) and more on effect of mitigation on adaptation (22%) than the opposite (11%). In the third conceptualization ('joint objectives'), there were more cases about strengthening (16%) than weakening (2%), competition (1%) or synergy (5%) (  Table 1 ). 
 JOINT OUTCOMES: LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO BOTH ADAPTATION AND MITIGATION Even in the analyzed cases where landscape management was not motived by climate-related objectives, it delivered both adaptation and mitigation benefits as joint outcomes. For example, conservation agriculture practices in the Mediterranean region reduced greenhouse gas emissions from soils or fertilizers as well as the vulnerability of crops to rainfall variability, thus contributing to both mitigation and adaptation.  23  Another case from this region showed how soil management increased soil organic carbon, which in turn built crop resilience to climate while also sequestering carbon.  24  Planting multipurpose trees in New Zealand provided both adaptation and mitigation outcomes  25  ; in Australia, woody biomass production for renewable energy reduced emissions and was less vulnerable than agricultural practices in a drought context.  26  Some cases highlighted how adaptation and mitigation outcomes could be unintendedly produced while pursuing nonclimatic objectives, such as soil conservation or sustainable food production. In other cases, the analysis of climate-related outcomes was done for prioritizing activities: in this case, the adaptation and mitigation outcomes were analyzed as secondary objectives and the joint outcomes were considered intended. In an example of agriculture in Australia, several measures were selected for their contribution to both adaptation and mitigation, such as tree planting that increased shade and shelter for a more resilient livestock and sequestered carbon for climate  mitigation.  27  Similarly, agroforestry and the restoration and sustainable management of ecosystems were highlighted for their joint adaptation and mitigation outcomes.  28  But these cases did not analyze how adaptation outcomes affected mitigation outcomes (or vice versa), as in the two other conceptualizations. The analyzed cases showed a diversity of landscape management activities contributing to adaptation and mitigation. The most frequent cases were related to agriculture, soil management, ecosystem conservation, and forestry (  Figure 3 ). Ecosystem conservation and management in landscapes were often presented as a way of contributing to both adaptation and mitigation, through improving carbon storage in ecosystems and conserving watersheds for the protection of downstream populations against climatic variations.  29  These ecosystem-based strategies included soil management, with benefits for soil carbon storage and soil fertility (increasing the resilience of agriculture), and water infiltration (improving aquifer recharge and buffering the effect of climate variations on water availability). In these cases, the links between adaptation and mitigation resulted from the synergies and trade-offs between ecosystem services: 30 carbon sequestration for mitigation and a series of ecosystem services for adaptation, such as water regulation or coastal protection. 10 
 UNINTENDED SIDE EFFECTS: ADAPTATION AFFECTS MITIGATION, MITIGATION AFFECTS ADAPTATION Many analyzed cases highlighted that adaptation activities could affect emissions by increasing or decreasing  them and mitigation activities could affect vulnerability likewise, even when these effects were not planned. Adaptation measures in landscape management were shown to produce mitigation services in several ways  (Table 2 ). In agriculture, such adaptation measures included soil conservation, which protected soil carbon,  31  water saving and the reduction of fertilizer use, which reduced energy-related emissions.  32  For livestock, adaptation measures included feed supplements and reduction in stocking densities, which also reduced methane emissions.  39  In conservation and forest management, measures that increased ecosystem resilience to climate also increased the permanence of carbon.  36  In ecosystem-based adaptation, protecting vegetation for reducing flood risk in watersheds or heat stress in cities affected multiple ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration for mitigation.  40  Finally, an indirect impact of adaptation on mitigation occurred when adapting agriculture to climate change reduced the need to convert new lands for farming, which influenced land-use change emissions.  41  But adaptation measures in landscapes can also affect mitigation negatively. For example specific adaptation measures for reducing agricultural vulnerability to climate variations were showed to increase emissions through nitrogen fertilization or energy-intensive irrigation technology.  31  In plantation forestry, shortening plantation rotation can be an adaptation measure but it decreases carbon stocks.  43  Fire suppression can be also an adaptation measure in some places but, if it is poorly planned, it can jeopardize the permanence of carbon stocks in the long term.  44  Similarly, mitigation measures in landscape management were shown to deliver adaptation services by reducing the vulnerability of ecosystems, agriculture, or the broader landscape. Conserving ecosystems for their carbon also conserved the ecosystem services relevant to adaptation-such as microclimatic regulation for people and crops, wood and fodder for livelihoods, soil erosion protection and soil fertility enhancement for agricultural resilience, coastal area protection, and water regulation.  45, 46  Mechanisms for forest carbon conservation (such as REDD+) could also improve forest resilience to climate change by conserving biodiversity, increasing landscape connectivity and reducing fire risks.  53  Initiatives that aim to achieve carbon sequestration in forests or emission reduction in energy could diversify local livelihoods, enhance incomes or health, and strengthen local institutions, which can sometimes facilitate adaptation to climate change.  54, 60  Finally, carbon payments were seen as an alternative livelihood that could improve economic resilience to climate shocks.  21  Negative impacts of mitigation actions on adaptation included cases where forest and biofuel plantations impeded community adaptation as they decreased food security, competed for land, and provided only short-term benefits for a few stakeholders.  20, 61  Plantations could also reduce water availability, particularly in arid regions.  64  In addition, maximizing carbon sometimes led to management that reduced ecological resilience through fast-growing tree monocultures.  68  Finally, hydropower projects for mitigation could lead to population displacement and increase social vulnerability to several exposures, including climate variations. 47 
 JOINT OBJECTIVES: THE WHOLE IS GREATER (OR SMALLER) THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS The cases examined analyzed landscape management activities that integrated both adaptation and mitigation objectives, one being sometimes prioritized over the other. Several analyzed cases showed that the addition of adaptation objectives to a mitigation project strengthened the mitigation outcomes (and vice versa) (  Table 3 ). The addition of adaptation objectives could strengthen mitigation projects for several reasons. Some were similar to the unintended side effects of adaptation on mitigation, such as carbon permanence (enhancing ecosystem adaptation improves the permanence of carbon storage in mitigation projects and reduces climate risks for projects) or avoided activity displacement (adapting agriculture or other livelihood activities to climate change may improve the sustainability of REDD projects by reducing pressures on forests).  [70] [71] [72]  Another example was related to ecosystem services for clean energy: adaptation programs in watershed conservation and in feedstock production could make clean hydropower and bioenergy production more sustainable.  73, 80, 82    Policy support Building a low emission economy may have more political support than adaptation, which is less understood 80,81 Project appeal Additional mitigation outcomes may improve adaptation project image, solvency and profitability, thus increase its appeal  29  Considering mitigation in adaptation initiatives reduces adaptation outcomes (weakening) Path dependency Mitigation objectives may restrict opportunities for livelihood adaptation in the long term (e.g., by restricting the conversion of forests to more productive activities)  47  Target groups Additional mitigation objectives may change the target groups of an adaptation project, from the most vulnerable to the most responsible for emissions  55  Integrating mitigation and adaptation increases outcomes (synergy) Minimized trade-offs Integrated initiatives will assess and minimize trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation, resulting in increased outcomes 28,48 
 Ecological reciprocal interactions Adaptation and mitigation outcome can reinforce each other, e.g., increased soil carbon (mitigation) can increase crop resilience (adaptation), which in turn protects soil carbon An additional perspective was described in the cases in which the proactive inclusion of adaptation into a mitigation initiative benefited the stakeholders of an initiative or facilitated its implementation. Arguments related to local acceptance (integrating adaptation into mitigation could encourage the engagement of local stakeholders or increase project sustainability from a socioeconomic perspective) and the political economy at the national scale (integrating adaptation into mitigation could encourage the engagement of national policy makers when adaptation responds to national priorities). However, the integration of adaptation into mitigation can also have negative effects on mitigation outcomes by increasing project costs and diverting efforts from the primary objective.  65  Several cases discussed how additional mitigation objectives could facilitate the implementation of adaptation projects. The most frequent argument was that by adding mitigation, adaptation initiatives could benefit from mitigation funding and carbon markets; REDD+ money could be used to pursue adaptation objectives.  55, 83  In some cases, building a low-emissions economy was perceived to have more political support than adaptation, which was less well understood by policy makers. Finally, additional mitigation outcomes were seen as a way of improving adaptation project image, solvency and profitability, thus increasing its appeal.  80, 81  But negative effects were also reported in the analyzed cases: adding a mitigation objective could restrict opportunities for livelihood adaptation in the long term by restricting the conversion of forests to more productive activities.  47  Furthermore, additional mitigation objectives could change the target groups of an adaptation project, from the most vulnerable to the most responsible for emissions.  55  Several analyzed cases described potential benefits of integrating adaptation and mitigation in landscape management and related policies. Integrated initiatives at the national level contributed to sustainable development, were more strongly linked to national policies, and reconciled national and global interests, increasing their likelihood of success.  87  As the factors enabling societies to adapt and mitigate are often similar, integrated policies should act together on these factors and increase overall effectiveness.  18  More integration of adaptation and mitigation at the international level was reported to be a way of giving developing countries a more active role in international climate policies.  17  At various scales, the new language of low emissions and resilient development, and related terms such as climate compatible development, was perceived as a way of making mitigation and adaptation more attractive.  18  At the local scale, examples were given of adaptation and mitigation reinforcing each other in both directions, such as when soil carbon is increased (mitigation) crop resilience is increased (adaptation) that in turn protected soil carbon (mitigation).  31  One proposed reason for adaptation-mitigation integration was that it would create new opportunities of doing adaptation (or mitigation) where one of the two would not have happened otherwise,  29  with a cost efficiency that would facilitate their implementation.  22  However, considering both adaptation and mitigation objectives in a project or a policy can have drawbacks. For example, it was suggested that a strong emphasis on integration may create perverse incentives-and activities that are good at delivering only Integration will lead to greater institutional complexity, which could reduce efficacy, make project difficult to implement and cost-ineffective and weaken adaptation and mitigation outcomes 89 one outcome would be neglected.  18  Another proposed drawback was that integration would lead to greater institutional complexity, which could reduce efficacy, make projects difficult to implement, increase costs, and weaken adaptation and mitigation outcomes. 89 
 DISCUSSION AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS The review showed a diversity of links between adaptation and mitigation in landscape management, including: (1) the joint delivery of adaptation and mitigation outcomes by activities that are not primarily motivated by climate objectives; (2) the positive or negative side effects of activities aimed at either mitigation or adaptation objectives on the other objective; and (3) the benefits or drawbacks of the integration of adaptation and mitigation objectives, which can lead to improved or weakened outcomes. However, empirical knowledge is missing: many links between adaptation and mitigation were described in conceptual or opinion papers or were illustrated with examples from other papers or with hypothetical examples. Only 40% of the papers were empirical (i.e., included field measurement, modeling, perception analysis) and 11% assessed adaptation or mitigation projects and activities on the ground. We used these papers in most of the examples in this review. In addition, most reviewed cases (84%) reported positive interactions between adaptation and mitigation: unintended side effects were often positive (more 'service' cases than 'disservice' in  Table 1 ) and managing for joint objectives generally improved outcomes (more 'strengthening' and 'synergy' than 'weakening' and 'competition' in  Table 1 ).This result may suggest that win-win situations are more frequent than win-lose or lose-lose ones but it can also come from a bias in the research on this topic. Because of the limited number of empirical papers and trade-off analyses, the analyzed literature informs on what is possible (e.g., soil management can lead to mitigation and adaptation outcomes), but does not allow a deeper analysis of either the management issues associated with joint adaptation and mitigation or the patterns in the practices needed to secure these outcomes. The three broad conceptualizations of the links between adaptation and mitigation suggest a number of policy implications which are important for framing political debates and negotiations on this topic, one example being the joint mitigation and adaptation approach proposed by Bolivia to the UNFCCC.  90  The first conceptualization (joint outcomes) highlights that many landscape management activities can lead to adaptation and mitigation outcomes (either positive or negative) even if these outcomes are not intentional. A more conscious approach to these interactions between nonclimate specific landscape approaches and climate change objectives would suggest that adaptation and/or mitigation should be mainstreamed in agricultural or forestry policies. This mainstreaming is needed to manage trade-offs between nonclimate and climate policy objectives, and to be able to exploit positive interactions.  7  But should mitigation and adaptation be mainstreamed separately into land-use policies or jointly? There are a number of advantages in mainstreaming adaptation and mitigation separately within sectoral policies. These relate primarily to the difference in terms of temporal and spatial scale at which mitigation and adaptation actions are effective, the difficulty of aggregating costs and benefits, and the fact that some sectors are more relevant for either mitigation (industry and transport)-or adaptation (health, disaster management, and coastal areas).  4, 7  In landscape management, adaptation and mitigation could be also mainstreamed separately, with adaptation and mitigation outcomes being delivered side-by-side rather than by the same activities. The high number of cases of unintended side effects shows that within the land-use sector, adaptation actions and policies often have positive or negative outcomes on mitigation and vice versa. This suggests that it might be beneficial to mainstream mitigation and adaptation jointly into land-use policies and planning processes: as the same activities can deliver both outcomes, it would be redundant to have separate processes.  5  This is particularly true in the forestry and agricultural sectors which are often considered priority sectors for both mitigation and adaptation policies.  6  Such an approach would require that the positive and negative interactions between the two climate change objectives and land-use planning and policy objectives are considered from the outset. An explicit approach that considers such interactions has not been extensively pursued to date. The instances related to 'joint objectives' appear only sporadically in the literature, suggesting that few current approaches consider the dual objectives of achieving both adaptation and mitigation outcomes simultaneously. The reviewed cases show that addressing adaptation and mitigation together in policies related to landscape management provides benefits, but can also have drawbacks. There is a knowledge gap on the implications of intentionally managing for one versus two climate outcomes. Adapting the definition of environmental policy integration given by Lafferty and Hovden 91 to the case of adaptation and mitigation, climate policy integration could be defined as the incorporation of adaptation and mitigation objectives into policymaking of sectoral policies (e.g., agriculture), the aggregation of adaptation and mitigation outcomes into policy evaluation, and the minimization of contradictions between both adaptation, mitigation and sectoral policy objectives. Policy integration also requires the removal of internal contradictions among climate change policies: these contradictions are clear in some analyzed cases where integrated approaches led to lose-lose rather than win-win situations. The best way to achieve this aim is through a type of climate policy integration that considers both potential trade-offs and mutual benefits between adaptation and mitigation when mainstreaming climate change into land-use planning and policies.  [92] [93] [94]  Climate change policy integration is both a 'process of governing' and a 'policy outcome.'  95  To ensure climate policy integration, we need to move from the traditional 'endof-pipe' approach to a preventative approach that considers both adaptation and mitigation from the stage of policy formulation and includes consideration of specific institutional structures and procedures that can facilitate such integration.  * a, adaptation objective; m, mitigation objective; x, nonclimate-related objective; [ ], secondary objective; !, results in; +, positive outcome; −, negative outcome; A, adaptation outcome; M, mitigation outcome; +AA or +MM, increased outcome as a result of an interaction between A and M; −AA or −MM, decreased outcome as a result of an interaction between A and M; frequency or percentage of cases found in the review; *,less than 5% of the 274 cases; **, 5-10%; ***, 10-25%; ****, more than 25%.

As of 19 June 2015, 1338 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) leading to at least 475 deaths  (WHO, 2015) . Saudi Arabia is the most affected country with 1030 laboratory confirmed patients. Middle East respiratory syndrome patients have also been reported from Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, United Arab of Emirates (UAE), Iran and Yemen. MERS has been reported from travellers arriving from these countries into Europe (Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Turkey, UK), Africa (Algeria, Egypt, Tunisia), Asia (China, Malaysia, Philippines; Republic of Korea, Thailand) and North America (USA). Some limited secondary transmission has been associated with some travel-associated patients with MERS but one large outbreak in the Republic of Korea led to over 160 human MERS infections  (WHO, 2015) . Large clusters of human cases have been identified in Saudi Arabia, Jordan and UAE, most of these being associated with human-to-human transmission within healthcare facilities  (Assiri et al., 2013; Oboho et al., 2015; WHO, 2015) . While some of these case clusters are large, humanto-human transmission remains inefficient and sustained community transmission has not being documented so far  (Majumder et al., 2014; WHO, 2015) . However, it is relevant to note that the emergence of SARS in 2002 was heralded by repeated self-limited outbreaks of human disease, but that virus finally adapted to transmission in humans, spreading to 25 countries across five continents, infecting approximately 8000 individuals and leading to almost 800 deaths  (Peiris et al., 2004) . Thus, it is important to understand the ecology and epidemiology of MERS so that zoonotic disease can be prevented and epidemic or pandemic threats mitigated. 
 Source of Zoonotic Infection Zoonotic infections may arise from domestic animals as well as wild life. Seroepidemiological studies have been carried out in domestic livestock (cattle, sheep, goats, horses and poultry) in the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East, but dromedary camels were the only species from which antibodies specific to MERS-CoV have been detected  (Hemida et al., 2013; Perera et al., 2013; Reusken et al., 2013a,b; Meyer et al., 2014) . Serological evidence of MERS-CoV infection of dromedaries has been reported from the Arabian Peninsula including Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, Qatar and Jordan with seroprevalence in adult animals generally being >90%  (Hemida et al., 2013 Reusken et al., 2013a,b; Alexandersen et al., 2014; Nowotny and Kolodziejek, 2014b) . Serological evidence of MERS-CoV infection has also been demonstrated in dromedaries from Africa, including Egypt, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Tunisia, Sudan and the Canary Islands, with similarly high seroprevalence except Tunisia and Canary Islands, where adult seroprevalence was 54% and 14%, respectively  Reusken et al., 2013a Reusken et al., , 2014 Corman et al., 2014b) . In general, seroprevalence in adult animals was higher than in juveniles. Testing of archived dromedary sera has revealed that MERS-CoV has been circulating in camels in the Arabian Peninsula for at least three decades and is not a newly emerged virus from camels  (Alagaili et al., 2014; Hemida et al., 2014; Meyer et al., 2014) . The only region where dromedaries have been seronegative so far is Australia . Data from dromedaries in Central Asia are lacking. Bactrian camels in Mongolia appear seronegative  (Chan et al., 2015) . MERS-CoV viral RNA has been detected in nasal swabs of dromedaries in Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and UAE. In camel abattoirs where animals from multiple sources are mixed together prior to slaughter, positive rates range from 1.9% to 34.6%  (Alagaili et al., 2014; Chu et al., 2014; Haagmans and Osterhaus, 2014; Hemida et al., 2014; Nowotny and Kolodziejek, 2014a; Raj et al., 2014; Wernery et al., 2015) . In a dromedary camel herd where virus transmission was tracked for over 1 month, the virus remained genetically unchanged, suggesting that MERS-CoV is well adapted to this species . Full-genome sequences of dromedary camel MERS-CoV from Saudi Arabia and Qatar revealed that the camel virus is very simi-lar to viruses detected in humans, including in the virus spike protein, suggesting that the virus in dromedaries can potentially infect humans  Raj et al., 2014) . Virus isolation of dromedary MERS-CoV has been reported in Vero cells  Raj et al., 2014) . Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus from humans and dromedaries have comparable capacity to infect and replicate in ex vivo cultures of the human respiratory tract, providing phenotypic evidence for the competence of dromedary viruses to infect humans . Temporal relationship between camel infection and development of human disease has been reported  (Memish et al., 2014a) . Virus genetic sequences from a person with MERS-CoV disease and from a camel with whom this person had recently been in close contact were very similar suggesting camel-to-human transmission does occur . Data from experimental camel infections suggest that MERS-CoV is a mild respiratory infection in camels  (Adney et al., 2014) , although this study was carried out with a cell culture adapted human MERS-CoV isolate rather than with the camel isolate. However, camel calves found shedding MERS-CoV in natural field settings also do not have overt clinical symptoms  Wernery, 2014) . Furthermore, camels sampled at abattoirs later shown to be shedding MERS-CoV did not have overt clinical symptoms . With the ubiquitous nature of MERS-CoV infection of dromedaries the lack of antibodies in Bacterin camels in Mongolia, as assessed by seroprevalence studies  (Chan et al., 2015) , it is likely that dromedaries are a natural host for this virus, but whether they are natural reservoir remains to be established. As an analogy, swine have high seroprevalence to Japanese encephalitis and are an amplifier host for transmission to humans, but wild birds are the natural reservoir for this virus. Similarly, dromedary camels are a natural host and source of human infection but they may or may not be the natural reservoir for the virus. While travel-associated MERS-CoV infections have been recognized in Egypt and Tunisia, no zoonotic transmission has been reported in East or North Africa in spite of virus being ubiquitous in camels. One possible explanation may be the lack of awareness that MERS may occur outside the Arabian Peninsula without a history of travel. A second possibility is that the MERS-CoV strains circulating in Africa are different in zoonotic potential. There is limited information on the genetic diversity or biological phenotype of MERS-CoV from Africa. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus from Egypt has been fully genetically sequenced and biologically characterized. While this virus was genetically diverse from viruses causing zoonotic infections in the Arabian Peninsula, the receptor binding domain of the Egyptian viruses is conserved, indicating that these viruses would be able to infect the human respiratory tract . This contention is supported by the finding that tropism and virus replication competence of MERS-CoV from Egypt in ex vivo cultures of the human bronchial and lung is comparable to that of camel of human virus isolates in the Arabian Peninsula . 
 Seroepidemiology of humans in contact with camels In a large countrywide seroepidemiological study of over 10 000 people older than 15 years carried out during 2012-2013 in KSA, an overall seroprevalence of 0.15% was detected while 5 of 140 (3.6%) of slaughterhouse workers were seropositive . The populationbased seroprevalence suggests that tens of thousands of MERS-CoV infections have gone unrecognized in Saudi Arabia  (Figs 1 and 2 ). This suggests that some patients with clinically overt MERS who have no obvious exposure to animals may well have acquired infection from such asymptomatic or mild infections, making the identification of true zoonotic infections a challenge. In a study in Qatar, 2% of camel farm workers, 14% of camel barn workers at an international racing track and 2 of 5 camel slaughterhouse workers were seropositive while none of 204 people with no camel contact were seropositive. In this slaughterhouse, virus RNA-positive rate in camels was as high as 60% on some sampling occasions indicating massive levels of human exposure  (Reusken et al., 2013b (Reusken et al., , 2015 . In other studies of some human with exposure to camels, there has been no evidence of seropositive to MERS-CoV  Memish et al., 2014b) . Humans regularly exposed to a dromedary herd known to be infected for at least a month had no clinical or serological evidence of infection  (Hemida et al., 2015) . In summary, humans with regular and heavy exposure to infected camels do become seropositive but casual exposure to infected camels does not lead to efficient human infection. Even camel abattoir workers who are exposed daily to animals who are regularly shedding MERS-CoV are not uniformly infected and rarely get overt disease. Hardly any of the patients diagnosed with MERS so far are workers in these high-risk occupations. In many respects, the epidemiology of human MERS shares similarities with that of avian influenza A H5N1 where the virus can be ubiquitous in poultry but human disease is stochastic and rare. This highlights the many questions that remain to be understood about the susceptibility and epidemiology of human MERS  (Fig. 3) . It is possible that unusual routes of exposure or heterogeneity of host susceptibility to MERS-CoV are important determinants of human disease. The possibility of a hitherto unidentified animal host or vector also remains to be more intensively investigated. Nevertheless, given the key role that dromedaries play as a natural host in the ecology of MERS-CoV and the potentially important role that dromedaries may play in zoonotic MERS infection, it is important to review the ecology and animal husbandry of dromedary camels in the Arabian Peninsula. 
 Distribution of Dromedary Camels in the Arabian Peninsula The global population of camels is estimated to be approximately 30 million, 95% of these being dromedary camels (reviewed in  Gossner et al., 2014) . Dromedary camels inhabit the Middle East region, North and East Africa and north-western parts of Asia  (Farah, 2001) . Bactrian camels (Camelus bactrianus), on the other hand, are native to the  Monthly human patients with MERS-CoV distributed by history of animal exposure (dark grey = not exposed, light grey = exposed) after exclusion of patients with hospital, community or healthcare personnel contact. Animal exposure (camels and other species) data were available from (September 2014 to January 2015), Saudi Ministry of Health. steppes of Central Asia and more adapted to regions with cooler climates. The dromedary and Bactrian camels share a common evolutionary origin with llamas, which originate from South America. Of the total of 28.5 million dromedary camels worldwide, 77% are in Africa, the largest camel populations being found in Somalia (6.2 million), Sudan (4.8 million), Kenya (3 million) and Ethiopia (2.3 million). Only approximately 4% are in the Arabian Peninsula. The highest density of camels by land area or by human population in the Arabian Peninsula is found in Qatar and UAE  (Gossner et al., 2014) .  Table 1  shows the numbers of camels in countries in the Arabian Peninsula. There is a strong positive correlation (r = 0.95, P < 0.001) between the total number of camels and the reported MERS-CoV cases across the Arabian Peninsula. Saudi Arabia and UAE which have the largest populations of camels are also the ones with the highest number of confirmed cases of MERS. Although there are differences between the camel census data proposed by FAO and the data from the different Ministries of Agriculture, especially in Saudi Arabia  (Table 1) , the overall correlation of camel numbers and human MERS remains high. In the Middle East, dromedary camels are indispensable to the traditional nomadic lifestyle, providing milk, meat, wool, leather, medicinal purposes as well as for transport, trade and racing. Thus, they are an important source of income and social prestige. More recently, camel husbandry in the Middle East has undergone significant changes. For example, the human population in Saudi Arabia has changed from being predominantly (80%) rural in the 1960s to currently being predominantly urbanized (87%) leading to associated changes in patterns of camel husbandry. In Saudi Arabia, six types of camel farms and husbandry have been described; commercial farms, racing farms, use of camels for leisure for urban dwellers (weekend farms), traditional camel farms, camels for renting and camels for prestige  (Abdallah and Faye, 2013) . More recently, a more detailed typology study of camel husbandry in Saudi Arabia identified the following categories: (i) those who are purely camel farmers, some grazing in the desert with more or less integration into the market systems and with variable levels of application of modern animal management methods; (ii) retired people keeping camels for recreational and other purposes; (iii) camel farmers with good integration to the market and with good health management systems; and (iv) multi-active owners practicing camel rearing as a hobby. There was a distinction between farmers living in the desert together with moving animals as a primary source of livelihood and those living in cities, having camels in peri-urban or sometimes in desert locations but for mainly social satisfaction rather than for economic reasons. Integration to the market for milk and meat drives owners to an increasingly peri-urban setting with improved supplemental diet and better health management  (Faye, 2013) . Some highly intensive farms are also emerging all over the Arabian Peninsula both for milk production (including milk processing with forms of pasteurized milk) and meat production (feed-lot farms of young male camels (hachi) often imported from the Horn of Africa). 
 Camel Movement Across the Arabian Peninsula and its Implications for the Transmission of MERS-CoV Camel herds frequently move across the Arabian Peninsula for many reasons such as grazing, participation in camel  Fig. 3 . Hypothesis of MERS-CoV transmission to humans. Green arrows represent confirmed transmission pathways. Red arrows represent potential transmission pathways, which may be confirmed in a few instances (for example, camel-to-human transmission in specific case reports) but not confirmed as main transmission pathways as yet. Recently, camel shows called Mazayin al-Ibl (meaning 'best of camels') have been annually held in many Gulf countries. One of the largest camel shows is usually held in November in Um al-Rughaiba in the Eastern Saudi Arabia, a region about 329 km from Riyadh and 160 km from Hafr al Batin city. More than 100 camel herds representing over 160 000 camels from all over the Arabian Peninsula travel every year to participate in this international festival and over than 160 000 people attend this event every year (Harrigan, 2008). Camel movement usually runs parallel to the common highways during their journey from each country or within Saudi Arabia to their destination Um al-Rughaiba, passing cities such as Dhahran and Buraydah  (Fig. 4) . A major racing and show competition is held annually in February in an area at the suburb of Riyadh called Janadriyah. Other festivals are held in other Gulf countries such as in UAE, the Abu Dhabi Authority of Culture and Heritage (ADACH) international festival in April  (Harrigan, 2008) . Similar festivals are held annually in other Gulf countries including Oman, Qatar and Kuwait. This is in addition to the local festivals held in each county throughout the year. This regular movement of camels crossing borders of many countries may contribute to the transfer, amplification and evolution of MERS-CoV. For example, previous studies documented high degree of relatedness between MERS-CoV sequences obtained from camel herds in Al-Ahsa and MERS-CoV from humans in UAE and Burydah . We speculated that the movement of camels between these locations may spread the virus during their journey. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus has been detected in camels crossing borders from Saudi Arabia into the UAE  (Yusof et al., 2015) . These journeys are bidirectional as camel herds actively move between places indicated on the map. One of the main aspects regarding the camel economy worldwide is the importance of camel regional markets, mainly for providing animals to the meat market. In this context, important flows of live camels are reported from the Horn of Africa (exporting countries are Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan, Kenya and Djibouti) to the North of the continent (Egypt, Libya) and to the countries of the Arabia Peninsula  (Faye, 2013) . These movements could be important in understanding the epidemiology and viral evolution of MERS-CoV. For example in Saudi Arabia, 131 932 camels were officially imported in 2013 representing more than 70% of the animals slaughtered in the Kingdom  (Mackay, 2014) . This camel trade through importation and exportation may affect the epidemiology of MERS-CoV and the introduction of viruses. The mixing of camels of different origins and immune status to MERS-CoV potentially provides opportunities for amplification and dissemination of MERS-CoV, analogous to what has been described for bovine coronaviruses in cattle where a high percentage of cattle, some of whom are already seropositive, actively shed bovine coronavirus nasally and in faeces shortly after mixing of animals or like in feed-lot cattle infected with BCoV  (Saif, 2010) . A similar situation also occurs with avian influenza in live poultry markets  (Sims and Peiris, 2013) . There is anecdotal evidence in camels that prior MERS-CoV seropositivity does not preclude re-infection . Importation of livestock, including camels, from the Horn of Africa led to the outbreak of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) that started in Saudi Arabia in 2000-2001 associated with zoonotic infections and death of several dozen humans. Indeed, some of these camels imported for meat production are fattened within the country of importation for several months before slaughter, providing ample opportunity for interaction with local camel herds and exchange of viruses. Animals imported from some of these countries imported camels proved to be seropositive to MERS-CoV . Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus isolated from dromedaries in the abattoirs in Egypt, animals potentially sourced from Sudan or Ethiopia, were phylogenetically diverse , providing a glimpse of the potential overall diversity of MERS-CoV. Some countries also import animals and then export them to the other neighbouring countries. Camel movements across the Arabian Peninsula and from the Horn of Africa to the Arabian Peninsula could contribute to or predispose to the introduction and amplification of MERS-CoV and be associated with an increase of human MERS cases. Further studies are required to confirm this hypothesis. A detailed, spatiotemporal understanding of camel movement patterns may explain the spread of disease and highlight high-risk areas. Furthermore, studies to genetically and phenotypically characterize the diversity of MERS-CoV in Africa are urgently needed. 
 Camel Calving Seasons and the Epidemiology of MERS-CoV Infections in Humans and Camels In the past few years, seasonal increase of human MERS cases in the Middle East, especially in Saudi Arabia and UAE during winter and early spring has been noted. Camels are seasonal breeders with the male rutting only during the winter months. The gestation period is 12-13 months, and thus, calving season is also limited to the winter period and early spring. By providing new na€ ıve hosts into the population in a seasonal manner, this reproductive cycle of dromedary camels could be associated with seasonal patterns of human MERS. The duration of passive maternal antibody and its role in suppressing infection by MERS-CoV remains to be fully defined. In addition, camel movement across the Arabian Peninsula during these times may also contribute to increased human disease. Several viral infections are common during the early life of different animal species such as coronaviruses and rotaviruses. Coronaviruses other than MERS affect newborn animals such as calves, lambs, foals and piglets  (Torres-Medina et al., 1985; Dea et al., 1995; Munoz et al., 1996; Davis et al., 2000) . The camel calving season usually occurs during the period late October to late February. Our studies and those of others have noted the association of dromedary MERS-CoV infection in camels and the calving season  Wernery, 2014) . In a follow-up of one camel herd, we detected the initial MERS-CoV infection by RT-PCR as early as late November with the peak of infection at late December, predominantly in calves . By the end of February, the infection has been cleared from the herd. A study of a camel herd in Dubai found that virus shedding was more common in calves and that virus shedding in calves was of relatively short duration  (Wernery et al., 2015) . As calves appear to have the highest risk of MERS-CoV infection, it has been suggested that delayed weaning of calves may reduce the opportunity for humans being exposed to calves. There was a large increase in human MERS occurring in Saudi Arabia during the period March-May 2014  (Majumder et al., 2014; Oboho et al., 2015) . This was largely related to amplification of transmission within healthcare facilities. However, it is possible that the calving patterns of camels may seed these large human outbreaks. 
 Potential Roles of Raw Milk, Improperly Cooked Meat and Raw Internal Organs of Camels in the Transmission of MERS-CoV Consumption of raw non-pasteurized milk has been proposed as a source of infection in one human MERS case  (Memish et al., 2014a,b) . The transmission of Hepatitis A virus, rabies virus and foot-and-mouth disease virus to humans through consumption of contaminated cow milk has been reported (Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention, USA 1999; Headrick et al., 1998) . Some other viruses such as tick-born encephalitis virus can be shed in milk during the active infection  (Caini et al., 2012) . Despite the potential risk of infection associated with drinking raw camel milk  (Mousa et al., 1988) , desert nomads in Arabian Peninsula often use raw camel milk as a whole meal for long periods which may last from days to months. They also drink raw milk because of the widespread belief that camel milk has prophylactic and therapeutic properties against many diseases and that boiling the milk destroys its nourishment and medicinal value  (Shamsia, 2009 ). Stability of MERS-CoV (strain Jordan-N3/2012) at different temperatures in camel, cow and goat milk was investigated. The infectivity of MERS-CoV in camel milk was greatly reduced at 22°C compared to that stored at 4°C . It should be noted, however, that this milk was sourced from seronegative camels for MERS-CoV. It is known that MERS-CoV-neutralizing antibody is secreted to camel milk and this may neutralize infectivity of any virus that may be present . This study also found evidence of MERS-CoV RNA in samples of camel milk collected by traditional milking practices where the flow of milk ('letting') is initiated by allowing a calf to suckle the dam. Once the flow of milk is initiated, the herdsman will continue manual milking. As calves are at high risk of acquiring MERS-CoV infection, it is possible that the milk may get contaminated with virus in the nasal secretions or saliva of calves. In the study which reported detection of MERS-CoV RNA in camel milk, it is unknown whether the virus entered milk through contamination from an infected calf or whether the udder was infected via systemic dissemination of the virus through the blood stream. Irrespective of the routes by which the virus can enter the camel milk, the facts support the possibility that raw camel milk could be a source of MERS-CoV infection. Heat treatment or pasteurization may reduce the risk of infection from milk to a minimum . Further epidemiological studies are needed to investigate the possibility of MERS-CoV shedding in camel milk. Camel meat is the most popular type of meat in the Arabian Peninsula and is widely consumed. In addition, some consume raw internal organs of camels, particularly liver and spleen and sometimes the lung. Both the Saudi Ministry of health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA had reported that eating the raw camel liver caused human bubonic plague in Saudi Arabia in  (Bin Saeed et al., 2005 . From the limited data from experimentally infected animals  (Adney et al., 2014) , it appears unlikely that camel meat and internal organs will have MERS-CoV through virus dissemination through a virema. However, contamination of such organs with respiratory tissues may occur during the process of slaughter, potentially leading to infection via this route. Further studies are needed to investigate the potential roles of these types of meat in MERS-CoV transmission. Camel urine is also used for medicinal purposes and is consumed alone or mixed with camel milk. However, experimental infections of dromedaries with MERS-CoV did not reveal evidence of viremia or evidence of virus in the urine  (Adney et al., 2014) . Thus, camel urine is an unlikely source of virus transmission to humans. MERS-CoV is relatively more stable in the environment than other enveloped viruses such as influenza (van . Thus, fomites and dust may also be a route of transmission to humans. 
 Role of Other Animal Sources of MERS-CoV Bats are incriminated in the origins of many known mammalian coronaviruses  (Lau et al., 2013) . SARS and the human coronavirus 229E appear to have arisen from precursor viruses in bats  (Pfefferle et al., 2009; Drexler et al., 2014) . There was one report that a short fragment (around 200 nucleotides) of viral RNA identical to that of MERS-CoV was detected in a Taphozous perforates bat in Saudi Arabia . However, this finding remains unconfirmed and this report needs to be regarded with caution. Coronavirus closely related to but not identical with MERS-CoV has been detected in Neoromicia capensis bats, but the spike protein in particular is very divergent, and this virus is unlikely to be the precursor of MERS-CoV  (Corman et al., 2014a,b) . However, these findings highlight the possibility that the MERS-CoV precursor may indeed be found in bats. In a recent study, we documented introduction of MERS-CoV into a camel farm which was in a closed compound without much intermingling with other animals. The source of introduction of this virus was unclear . Whether another animal host (bats, or other) was responsible for the introduction of the virus remains to be ascertained. Mechanical transmission by feed and manure removal trucks is another possibility. 
 Concluding Remarks Dromedary camels are likely to be a natural host of MERS, and transmission between camels is clearly documented. However, it is still unclear whether camels are the natural reservoir of the virus and the only source of human infection. Clearly, transmission from camels to humans does take place, and camel exposure is a risk factor for human infection but such transmission is not efficient and infection is not directly proportional to exposure. Heterogeneity of human susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection may be one possible explanation, as also proposed for avian influenza H5N1. Many thousands of people in the Arabian Peninsula appear to have evidence of unrecognized past MERS-CoV infection. On the other hand, many patients with clinically diagnosed MERS do not have an obvious history of direct exposure to camels or their products. This may be because such individuals are being infected from other humans who are infected with MERS unrecognized (asymptomatically or with mild illness). Thus, the true primary zoonotic infections may be difficult to identify. Alternate possibilities of other intermediate or reservoir hosts in the transmission of infection to humans also remains possible, and  Fig. 3  illustrates the many 'known unknowns' that remain to be elucidated.

Outbreaks of BT have a major impact on sheep rearing in southern India due to the high proportion of subsistence level sheep farmers in the region, who have limited access to vaccines and palliative care for their livestock  [2] . The aetiological agent of BT, bluetongue virus (BTV), is biologically transmitted between ruminant hosts by competent vectors of the genus Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae)  [3] . In India, the epidemiology of BTV is highly complex, potentially involving multiple vector species and with at least 21 BTV serotypes identified by serology  [1] , some of which may have been introduced during efforts to improve ruminant production  [4] . Seven putative BTV vector species are known to occur in India (Culicoides actoni Smith, 1929; C. brevitarsis Kieffer, 1917; C. dumdumi Sen & Das  Gupta, 1959 ; C. fulvus Sen & Das  Gupta, 1959 ; C. imicola Kieffer, 1913; C. oxystoma Kieffer 1910 and C. peregrinus Kieffer, 1910)  [1, [5] [6] [7] , although this implication is derived primarily from vector competence data collected in other countries. Culicoides imicola and C. oxystoma have been reported to extend across the Afrotropical, Saharo-Arabian and Oriental regions  [8, 9]  (geographic regions defined as per Holt et al.  [10] ). In contrast, C. actoni, C. brevitarsis, C. dumdumi, C. fulvus and C. peregrinus have been recorded in the Australian, Oceanian and Oriental region  [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , but not in the Saharo-Arabian and Afrotropical regions. The combination of multiple potential vector species and a huge diversity of BTV strains  [16, 17]  makes India one of the most challenging areas in which to dissect transmission cycles and highlights the importance of this region due to it sharing features of the Afrotropical, Saharo-Arabian, Oriental and Australasian ecozones  [6] . While broad relationships between Culicoides spp. abundance and transmission have been suggested  [1] , these remain very poorly defined and hence unpredictable. The Culicoides fauna of the Oriental region has been the focus of an authoritative taxonomic review based on morphology  [18] . Wirth & Hubert's review  [18] , however, did not extend to a comprehensive review of the Culicoides fauna of the Indian subcontinent and the Culicoides fauna of India has only been subject to sporadic morphological studies, e.g. Das Gupta  [19, 20] . Checklists of Indian species of Culicoides have been produced  [21] [22] [23] ; however, many contain misidentifications and synonymous species  [22, 23]  and/or propose new species with no supporting taxonomic data  [23] , rendering them of limited use with regard to compiling biodiversity inventories or investigating Culicoides-borne arbovirus epidemiology. In addition, molecular DNA analyses of the Indian Culicoides fauna are limited to a single DNA barcode  [24]  report focussed on five species sampled from a single location, with little comment regarding the specificity of the DNA barcodes relative to other Culicoides species or populations  [25] . Further DNA barcode and molecular studies are required to underpin morphological studies of the Culicoides fauna of India, as has been accomplished elsewhere to clarify species-level taxonomic descriptions  [26, 27] . Creating a fundamental base for Culicoides species diagnostics in India is a prerequisite for dissecting BTV epidemiology accurately in this country. Wider questions also exist regarding the phylogenetic and taxonomic relationships of Culicoides populations in southern India with those from other regions including the degree of haplotype connectivity between global populations of vector species. Attempts to resolve these questions may be achieved through the development of morphological and genetic datasets of Culicoides spp. from India that are comparable with those being produced elsewhere (for review, see Harrup et al.  [28] ). In addition to accurate species identification, a second fundamental requirement for accurate surveillance of Culicoides populations in southern India is the selection of appropriate monitoring tools. Systematic sampling of Culicoides populations using light-suction trapping next to livestock has been used to demarcate geographic and temporal risk of BTV transmission in Europe, Africa and Australia  [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . In both Europe and Africa, Culicoides spp. surveillance programmes are reliant upon the use of ultraviolet (UV) (~390 nm peak wavelength) light-suction traps, which have previously been shown to be highly effective at collecting C. imicola  [33] , the principle vector of BTV in Africa and the Mediterranean Basin. In Australia, however, green light emitting diode (LED) (~520 nm peak wavelength) light-suction traps are used to collect Culicoides spp. as part of the National Arbovirus Monitoring Program  [34] . The preference for using green light for the collection of Culicoides spp. in Australia is the result of field studies demonstrating that the primary BTV vector species in this region, C. brevitarsis, has a greater sensitivity to this wavelength than to other colours including UV  [31] . As both C. imicola and C. brevitarsis occur in India  [18] , it is important to define prior to the initiation of wide-scale surveillance project which light wavelength is most effective for surveillance of these and other Culicoides spp. in southern India. In addition, the logistical challenge of establishing field surveys and specifically the limited access to reliable mains electricity for recharging of batteries used to power light-suction trap surveys has limited adult Culicoides surveillance in India to single state studies involving one or a few sites. These challenges must be assessed prior to the deployment of large-scale surveillance programmes in order to confirm the selected equipment is both effective at the collection of Culicoides spp. and robust enough to withstand local conditions. In this study we DNA barcoded Culicoides spp. collected across southern India and assessed the phylogenetic utility of these DNA barcodes to provide species identifications in agreement with morphology-based taxonomic identifications. We included publically available DNA barcodes from global replicates of targeted species in our analyses to determine if the populations in India contained unique and/or cosmopolitan genetic diversity. In addition, we also assess the use of two commercially available LED Center for Disease Control (CDC) light-suction traps  [35, 36]  as a precursor to wide-scale surveillance of Culicoides spp. in southern India. In the absence of logistically feasible trapping methods that are reflective of biting rates on ruminants, the key considerations for such a surveillance scheme are that the selected light-suction traps collect a widediversity of Culicoides spp. and at a sufficient abundance to consistently discern seasonal patterns in abundance. 
 Methods 
 Specimen selection and morphological identification Seventy-three Culicoides specimens from seven sites and representing 12 morphologically identified species (Additional file 1:  Table S1 ) and one currently unknown species were selected for genetic characterisation  (Fig. 1)  [TN01 (n = 16); TN02 (n = 16); TN08 (n = 10); TN10 (n = 14); TN11 (n = 9); TN12 (n = 3); KA01 (n = 5)]. Sites TN01 and TN12 were located near Chennai, Tamil Nadu, TN02 near Kattupakkam, Tamil Nadu and TN11 near Erode, Tamil Nadu  (Fig. 1) , and are all located in areas characterised as having tropical wet and dry climates  [37] , being particularly effected by the north east monsoon. Site TN08 is located near Pudukottai, Tamil Nadu, a semi-arid area with high temperatures throughout the year and relatively low rainfall. Site TN10 is near Ooty in Tamil Nadu, an area with a subtropical highland climate  [37] . Site KA01 is located near Bangalore, Karnataka in an area with a tropical savannah climate  [37]  where the southwest monsoon has a greater influence than the northeast monsoon on climate conditions. Sites TN01, TN02, TN08, TN10, TN11 and KA01 were all located in areas principally utilised for subsistence and/or semi-intensive sheep, goat, cattle and buffalo rearing  (Fig. 2) . Site TN12 is located in an area of coastal inter-tidal marsh with lowlevel subsistence sheep, goat, cattle and buffalo farming present in the area  (Fig. 3) . Specimens selected for genetic analysis were collected either using an UV LED CDC light-suction trap (Model 2770, 390 nm peak wavelength: BioQuip Products, Rancho Dominguez, CA, USA) or a sweep net and stored in 70 % ethanol prior to identification. Culicoides  Fig. 1  Geographical location of sites from which Culicoides spp. specimens selected for genetic analysis were collected: TN01 (n = 16); TN02 (n = 16); TN08 (n = 10); TN10 (n = 14); TN11 (n = 9); TN12 (n = 3); KA01 (n = 5) specimens were selected for genetic characterisation following preliminary identification using an SMZ-140 stereomicroscope (Motic, Barcelona, Spain) and the keys of Boorman  [38] , Gangopadhyay & Das Gupta  [22]  and Wirth & Hubert  [18] , and the descriptions of Majumdar et al.  [39]  and Nandi & Mazumdah  [40, 41] . 
 Molecular identification DNA extraction Total DNA was extracted from individual Culicoides specimens using a non-destructive technique  [42] . Specimens were individually incubated in 200 μl of DXT Tissue Digest Reagent (QIAGEN, Crawley, UK) with 1 % Proteinase K (QIAGEN) for 16 h at 40°C. Culicoides were then stored at 4°C in 70 % ethanol prior to slide mounting. The remaining tissue digest solution was incubated at 70°C for 15 min to inactivate the proteinase K, and then ethanol-precipitated to remove PCR inhibitors using Pellet Paint® Co-Precipitant (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) to improve DNA yield. The purified DNA extractions were re-suspended in 100 μl of 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0 (Buffer EB: QIAGEN) and stored at 4°C. 
 COI DNA barcode assay Amplification of a 658 bp fragment of the mitochondrial COI gene barcoding region  [24]  was achieved by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using an Eppendorf® Mas-tercycler® Pro (Eppendorf®, Chennai, India) thermal cycler. Reactions were performed in a total volume of 25 μl consisting of 2.5 μl nuclease-free water (QIAGEN), 12.   [43] ) and 5.0 μl of template DNA (approximately 5-25 ng DNA) for each reaction. Positive and negative controls for the amplification reactions were carried out at every PCR round. The PCR cycling conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation step at 94°C for 3 min followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 46°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension step at 72°C for 10 min. Reactions were stored at 4°C until further processing. PCR products were visualised through electrophoresis on 2 % (w/v) pre-cast agarose gels containing ethidium bromide (E-Gel™ 48 gels: ThermoFisher Scientific,  
 PCR purification and COI sequencing Dimer formation from the primers was not observed and purification of the remaining PCR product was performed using the MinElute® PCR purification kit (QIAGEN) following manufacturers recommended guidelines (v. 03/2008). The resulting products were sent for bi-directional sequencing using primers HCO2198 (reverse) and LCO1490 (forward) at a commercial facility (Eurofins, Bangalore, India). The resulting electropherograms were edited and forward and reverse sequences assembled and trimmed to remove primer sequence using CodonCode Aligner v. 5.1.5 (CodonCode Aligner, Centerville, MA, USA). Corresponding specimen collection data and DNA sequences including electropherograms have been made publically available via the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD)  [44]  as dataset DS-CULIN (dx.doi.org/10.5883/ DS-CULIN) and DNA sequences are also available in the GenBank database under accession numbers KT307786-KT307856. 
 Phylogenetic analysis Consensus sequences were compared to previously published sequences in the GenBank database using the standard nucleotide BLAST tool  [45] , in addition to comparison to as yet unreleased sequence data in the BOLD database  [44]  using the Barcode Identification Engine in BOLD v3. Sequences from GenBank included in the phylogenetic analysis (n = 196) are listed in Additional file 1:  Table S1 . GenBank sequences were included in the analysis to assess if the morphological identifications made within this study were conspecific with those made from other geographical regions and were not confounded with species morphologically similar enough to result in misidentification, e.g. C. brevitarsis and C. bolitinos Meiswinkel, 1989  [26] . All sequences were aligned using MUSCLE  [46]  and quality checked using GUIDANCE  [47]  (100 bootstraps). All included sequences were aligned with a high degree of confidence (GUIDANCE alignment score > 0.999). The general time reversible model with gamma-distribution rates plus invariant Sites (GTR + Γ + I) was identified using ModelTest2  [48, 49]   The phylogenetic relationships among taxa were resolved using a Bayesian Inference (BI) approach  [50, 51] , with the topology rooted on the partial COI sequence of Anopheles gambiae Giles, 1902 (NC002084  [52] ). The BI tree was constructed using MrBayes v.3.2.2  [50, 51]  and twenty million tree generations in four chains were run, sampling every 1000th and discarding the first 25 %, before constructing a 50 % majority rule consensus tree reporting Bayesian posterior probabilities. The absence of indicators of a lack of convergence in the final consensus BI topology was confirmed via the examination of the sampled Markov chain Monte Carlo tree topologies using AWTY  [53] . Relationships between the observed haplotypes within the C. brevitarsis -C. asiana Bellis, 2014 (nomen novum for C. asiatica Bellis  [54]  preoccupied by C. asiaticus Gutsevich & Smatov 1966; specimens redescribed by Bellis et al.  [26] ), C. imicola and C. oxystoma clades were assessed by constructing Median-Joining networks. Roehl haplotype data files (RDF) were created with DnaSP v.5.10  [55]  and imported into Network v.4.6.1.2  [56]  and networks were calculated with the Median-Joining algorithm  [57]  with equal weights for all characters, using maximum parsimony  [58]  post-processing. Uncorrected intra-and inter-specific percentage sequence distances were generated using the packages Spider v 1.3-0  [59]  and Ape v.3.2  [60] , implemented in R v.3.1.2  [61] . Missing nucleotides were treated in all sequence comparisons using a pairwise deletion option. 
 Morphological voucher specimens Following DNA extraction specimens were then individually dissected and slide mounted in Euparal following the techniques of Nevill & Dyce  [62] . Mounted specimens were re-examined following mounting and identifications confirmed using the keys of Boorman  [38] , Gangopadhyay & Das Gupta  [22]  and Wirth & Hubert  [18] , and the descriptions of Majumdar et al.  [39]  and Nandi & Mazumdah  [40, 41] . 
 Light-suction trap comparison Commercially produced, modified CDC design lightsuction traps fitted with LEDs were compared (Model 2770: BioQuip Products, Rancho Dominguez, CA, USA). The LED platforms emitted peak light wavelengths of either 390 nm (UV) or 570 nm (Green) and were powered by 6 V batteries. An inline photo-switch (BioQuip) was also used on each trap to standardise collection periods, reduce battery consumption during the trial and replicate their planned use in the surveillance programme. Two locations over 50 m apart at site TN01 (  Fig. 1 ) were chosen for this study (trap height approximately 1.5 m), both of which were in close proximity to ruminant livestock (1-5 m from cattle; 40-50 m from sheep). Trapping was conducted during November 2013, during the predicted peak BTV transmission period, for 20 nights, with the positions of the green and UV LED CDC traps rotated between the two sites on alternate nights. Overnight collections (approximately three hours before sunset to three hours after sunrise) were made into water containing a drop of detergent and then transferred the following morning to 70 % ethanol for storage prior to identification. Following collection, specimens of Culicoides were identified morphologically under a stereomicroscope using keys  [18, 63]  and comparison to reference specimens from the local area produced as part of the phylogenetic analysis conducted within this study. Specimens were sexed and females were further separated based on their abdominal pigmentation status (unpigmented/ nulliparous, blood-fed, gravid, or pigmented/ parous)  [64, 65] . In large collections (estimated by the investigator to contain more than 1,000 Culicoides spp. specimens), a standardised process of subsampling was used to estimate the abundance and diversity of Culicoides spp. present  [66] . In summary, for samples which were subsampled, insect collections were washed with water through a series of stainless steel test sieves (3.35 mm, 2.00 mm, 1.00 mm and 300 μm mesh diameter). The contents of the 300 μm sieve were then transferred to a weigh boat and weighed. Successive 1 g portions of the sample in the weigh boat were then sorted and identified. Successive 1 g portions were taken and completely sorted and identified until at least 650 individuals of Culicoides (any species) had been identified. The total number of specimens of a particular species of Culicoides in the original sample was then estimated as equal to the [(Total weight of the sieved sample/ number of grams of sample identified) × number of Culicoides of the species of interest identified in the subsample]. 
 Statistical analysis Relationships between female Culicoides abundance and five fixed effects were examined using generalised linear mixed models with a negative binomial error distribution (fitted using the glmmadmb package v 0.7.5  [67, 68]  in R  [61] ), three main effects of light type, position and species (including the five most abundant species) and two possible interactions (species × light type, to reflect that light types may be more attractive to some species than others and species × position, to reflect that a trap position may have been closer or further from a larval development site which may vary by Culicoides species). In all models, a random effect of trapping day was used. All possible combinations of the fixed effects were examined (including an intercept only model) and the model with the lowest AIC  [69]  was selected. The same procedure was followed for males, with the exception that a zero-inflated negative binomial error distribution was used to account for the higher proportion of zero catches for males which resulted in significantly overdispersed residuals in ordinary negative binomial models. The diversity of Culicoides species collected by the two trap types, i.e. the species richness, was further compared using the Margalef's index, such that Margalef's index = (S -1)/ln N, where S is the total number of species collected in a sample, i.e. one trap collection, N is the total number of individuals in the sample and ln is the natural logarithm  [70] . 
 Results 
 Phylogenetic analysis Full length primer truncated DNA barcode sequences of 658 bp were recovered from 71 of the 73 specimens sampled from India, representing 12 morphologically identified species: C. actoni; C. anophelis Edwards, 1922; C. brevitarsis; C. huffi  Causey, 1938    Table S2) , and one currently unidentified species. Amino acid frame shifts and stop codons were not evident among sequence translations, indicating pseudogenes were not likely to be included in the alignments. The COI sequences obtained from the GenBank (Additional file 1:  Table S1 ) overlapped the alignment of the sequences generated in this study by between 434 and 658 bp. Thirteen species from the collections in this study and a further six potentially morphologically confounding species (19 in total) were represented within the phylogenetic study  (Figs. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9) . Species clades represented in the Bayesian Inference (BI) phylogeny were concordant with morphological identifications with the exception of one specimen, TPI:ENT:IBVNET-CULI-TN-65, which could not be assigned to a species based on the morphological descriptions currently available in the literature, and is therefore recorded as 'Unknown Species (I)'  (Fig. 4 , Additional file 1:  Table S2  and Additional file 2:  Table S3 ). No discordant Barcode Index Numbers (BINs)  [71]  were observed for the species identifications of specimens collected within this study, with the exception of C. huffi, which resulted in two BINs being assigned thereby indicating the potential presence of two distinct taxa (see Additional file 1:  Table S2 ). In addition, C. actoni, C. brevitarsis, C. imicola and C. peregrinus currently all have multiple BINs per species name currently assigned within BOLD  [44] , indicating the presence of either misidentified specimens or unresolved cryptic diversity within the publically avaliable data. Deep interspecific differences within the COI DNA barcode region were present between the majority of Culicoides assessed within this study; however, there was no clear barcoding gap  [72, 73]  across all current species assignments  (Fig. 10) . The greatest intraspecific sequence differences were reported from within specimens morphologically identified as C. actoni (mean: 5.8 %; range: 1.5-8.1 %), followed by C. brevitarsis (mean: 3.2 %; range: 0- 5.6 %), C. huffi (mean: 2.5 %; range: 0-4.9 %), C. imicola (mean: 1.2 %; range: 0-9.0 %) and C. oxystoma (mean: 2.9 %; range: 0-5.8 %) (Additional file 2:  Table S3 ;  Fig. 11 ). These levels of sequence variation is more akin to interspecific values (Additional file 2,  Table S3 ), indicating cryptic taxa in the samples sequenced within these taxa, or morphological misidentifications in our dataset. All other pairwise intraspecific sequence differences were less than or equal to 2.0 %, i.e. within published ranges of intraspecific variation  [74]  (Additional file 2:  Table S3 ;  Fig. 11 ). The least mean sequence difference was between C. dubius Arnaud, 1956 and C. peliliouensis   Table S3 ). All other pairwise interspecific sequence difference were greater than 10.0 % (Additional file 2:  Table S3 ). No misidentifications occurred between species identified within the study and those considered isomorphic or morphologically similar for which COI DNA barcode sequence data was available. No geographic clustering was observed in the C. imicola haplotypes  (Figs. 5 and 7) . Three specimens collected in previous studies from Spain (GenBank: AF080528, AF080529 and AF080536) were, however, found to have between 2.7 and 4.6 %, 3.5-5.4 % and 6.0-9.0 % sequence difference, respectively, to other specimens identified as C. imicola. The range of intraspecific sequence differences within C. imicola when these three sequences were excluded was significantly reduced from mean of 1.2 % (range: 0-9.0 %) to mean of 1.0 % (range: 0-3.9 %). Sequences AF080528, AF080529 and AF080536 are likely to be either misidentifications or poor quality sequences and were excluded from subsequent investigations of haplotype relationships within C. imicola. A significant degree of geographic clustering was observed in the C. oxystoma haplotypes  (Figs. 6 and 8) , with haplotypes previously recorded from Senegal  [9]  clustering separately from specimens collected in the current study and from those in Australia, China, India, Israel and Japan  [75, 76]  which formed an Oriental-Australasian clade with between 3.7 and 5.8 % (mean: 4.3 %) sequence difference between the Oriental-Australasian and Senegalese clades  (Fig. 8) . Specimens morphologically identified as C. brevitarsis collected in southern India were strongly supported by BI as a monophyletic clade (100 % posterior probability) with sequence difference between 5.0-5.6 % (mean: 5.3 %)  (Fig. 9 ) to specimens collected from Australia, China, the Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste  [26] . They also differed from C. asiana specimens from Japan (= C. brevitarsis  [75] , misidentification  [26] ) (mean sequence difference: 6.9 %; range: 6.5-7.3 %)  (Fig. 9) . The three C. actoni sequences demonstrated 8.1 and 1.5 % sequence difference between the specimen collected in this study from southern India and the sequences previous published from Australia  [26]  and Japan  [75] , respectively. In comparison, Japanese and Australian C. actoni specimens showed 7.9 % sequence difference.   (Table 1) . Non-pigmented females dominated the collections in both trap types (51.9 % UV; 48.3 % green), followed by bloodfed (20.4 % UV; 21.8 % green) and pigmented individuals (18.0 % UV; 18.5 % green), with only a few gravid females collected (0.6 % UV; 0.4 % green) (  Table 1 ). The relative proportion of the trap catches made up of the different parity states were not significantly different between the UV and green LED CDC traps; however, the UV LED CDC trap collected significantly more male and female Culicoides than the green LED CDC trap (Paired t-test: t = 6.464, df = 19, P < 0.001). Over 16 times more females were collected using the UV LED CDC trap than in the green LED CDC trap. 
 Green versus UV wavelength comparison trial Eight species (morphologically identified) were represented within the LED CDC trap collections (in order of abundance): C. oxystoma, C. peregrinus, C. imicola, C. brevitarsis, C. anophelis, C. innoxius, C. peliliouensis and C. huffi. All species were present in both UV and green LED CDC trap collections, with the exception of C. huffi, which was absent from green LED CDC trap collections  (Table 1) . Trap catches from both trap types were dominated by C. oxystoma and C. peregrinus which together (See figure on previous page.)

Culicoides imicola and C. oxystoma clade summarised, see Figs. 5 and 6 for further details represented 65.6 and 32.7 % of Culicoides specimens in the UV, and 82.7 and 13.6 % of Culicoides specimens in the green trap collections respectively, with the other species collected making up just 3.7 and 1.8 % of the trap catch collectively for the green and the UV trap, respectively  (Table 1 ,  Fig. 12 ). The relative abundance of the most abundant species, C. oxystoma and C. peregrinus, significantly varied between the green and UV traps  (Fig. 12) . Overall diversity (i.e. the number of different Culicoides spp. present within a trap catch) did not vary significantly between the green and UV LED CDC traps, as measured by the Margalef's index (mean: 0.50; range: 0.32-0.73 and mean: 0.57; range: 0.33-0.91 for the UV and green LED CDC traps, respectively)  (Fig. 13) . Due to the low numbers collected, C. innoxius, C. huffi and C. peliliouensis were excluded from the following statistical analysis. Numbers of female Culicoides collected by the LED CDC traps were significantly affected by the variables species and light type and the by the interaction variable species × light type (  Table 2 ). The UV light trap collected significantly more female C. peregrinus than the green LED CDC trap. There were, however, no significant differences in the numbers of female C. anophelis, C. brevitarsis, C. imicola or C. oxystoma collected by the UV compared to green LED CDC trap (Table 2;  Fig. 12 ). Species and light type were also key determinants of the numbers of male Culicoides collected (  Table 2 ). The UV LED CDC traps collected a significantly larger number of male C. imicola, C. oxystoma and C. peregrinus than the green LED CDC traps (Table 2;  Fig. 12 ). There were, however, no significant differences in the numbers of male C. anophelis and C. brevitarsis, collected by the UV compared to green LED CDC trap (Table 2;  Fig. 12 ). 
 Discussion This study presents the first detailed multi-site genetic analysis of Culicoides in southern India with new COI DNA barcode sequence data presented for 12 previously recognised species, and potentially up to four cryptic or unidentified taxa. To the best of our knowledge, Culicoides mesghalii and C. kepongensis are recorded for the first time in India and C. peliliouensis and C. similis are recorded for the first time in southern India. The study  Fig. 5  Bayesian Inference phylogenetic tree of the C. imicola clade inferred from COI DNA barcode sequences. Bayesian posterior probability node support values greater than 0.7 shown.

See  Fig. 4  for the relative placement of the C. imicola clade with respect to other specimens analysed within this study also reveals the potential for deep sequences differences symptomatic of cryptic species diversity within C. actoni, C. brevitarsis and C. huffi, which require further investigation. In addition, further evidence of geographic clustering and potential cryptic species diversity within C. oxystoma is presented, in support of that identified by Bakhoum et al.  [9] . With these caveats, morphological identification of the species considered the most likely vectors of BTV in India was demonstrated to be robust, with no misidentifications of the main putative vector species. In addition, commercially produced UV LED light-suction traps were shown to outperform traps fitted with green LED's for Culicoides spp. collection, based on both the total number and diversity of specimens of Culicoides collected. These   Fig. 4  for the relative placement of the C. oxystoma clade with respect to other specimens analysed within this study findings collectively address many of the logistical requirements for effective Culicoides spp. sampling in southern India. The provision of DNA barcode data for putative BTV vector species in southern India fills an important gap in our knowledge of the phylogeny of these species. An east-west split in haplotypes of C. imicola specimens from the Mediterranean basin was previously identified using COI sequencing by Calvo et al.  [77] , Dallas et al.  [78]  and Nolan et al.  [79] . The present study has shown that four C. imicola COI haplotypes are present in southern India; two are unique to India, one is identical to specimens collected in Israel and South Africa and the other is identical to specimens collected in China, Israel, South Africa and Portugal. The status of the latter sample from Portugal (GenBank: AF079975) requires reevaluation as this sample does not fit with previously proposed eastern-western haplotype demarcation in the Mediterranean basin. In addition, three publically available sequences (GenBank: AF080528, AF080529 and AF080536) labelled as C. imicola but with sequences differences of 2.9, 3.7 and 7.5 % respectively to the nearest other C. imicola sequence have been highlighted as likely to be the result of misidentification, crosscontamination or poor sequence quality. Genetic divergence and population structure within C. imicola, the principal Afrotropical vector of BTV, are subject to ongoing investigations  [80, 81]  that will assist in clarifying the status of this pan-continental species. The status of the subgenus Remmia Glukhova (= Schutzei group) of Culicoides in Asia has historically been fraught with confusion  [18] . This is particularly the case in India with numerous publications citing the presence of C. schultzei  [12] [13] [14] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] , despite the fact that C. schultzei is an Afrotropical species while the typelocality of C. oxystoma is Kolkata in India. These two species are, however, both morphologically  [18, 87]  and genetically  [9, 76, 88]  distinct, and current evidence agrees with the earlier proposal by Cornet  [89]  that C. oxystoma is the species present in India. Furthermore, Indian C. oxystoma specimens form part of the Saharo-Arabian-Oriental-Australian clade, but further investigation is needed to see if the two genetic groupings of Bakhoum et al.  [9]  correlate with the morphological variation observed by Wirth & Hubert  [18] , and whether they are supported by data from additional genetic markers. Recent re-evaluations of the Imicola Complex by Bellis et al.  [26]  provide strong evidence that C. brevitarsis specimens identified in Japan are in fact the novel species C. asiana  [26]  (= C. asiatica Bellis, 2014  [54] ). Further cryptic diversity between Australian and Chinese C. brevitarsis was suggested by analysis of the COI region, but this was not supported by analysis of the fused carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, aspartate transcarbamylase and dihydroorotase (CAD) nuclear genes  [26] . Similar investigations are required to explore the potential cryptic diversity identified between the Indian and Australian specimens of C. brevitarsis. There is no evidence that the morphologically indistinguishable C. bolitinos  [26, 90]  is present in southern India as this species is genetically distinct from the Indian C. brevitarsis (mean sequence difference compared to South African C. bolitinos: 12.2 %; range: 11.6-12.6 %). The Indian C. brevitarsis is also genetically distinct (mean sequence difference: 11.1 %; range: 10.6-11.5 %) from C. bolitinos specimens recently collected in Reunion Island (GenBank: KF186129 and KF186130)  [91] , which have been provisionally identified as C. bolitinos, but which have been shown to be genetically distinct from South African C. bolitinos (mean sequence difference: 6.4 %; range 5.6-6.9 %). The latter relationship and the implications of this potential cryptic diversity within C. bolitinos are yet to be resolved. The single C. actoni COI sequence from India is consistent with the Asian clade of this species, and is consequently different to the species in Australia  [92]  upon which vector competence studies for this species are based  [93] . As such, there is no data on the vector potential of Indian C. actoni. Nevertheless, the Indian species, which almost certainly belongs to C. actoni (senso stricto)  [92] , is closely related to the proven vector in Australia and warrants investigation into its potential as a vector of BTV. The sequence difference between C. peregrinus specimens from China, Japan, India and Thailand was 1.2-1.7 %. However, Australian specimens have been the basis of C. peregrinus BTV vector incrimination studies  [93]  and the south Indian specimens of C. peregrinus assessed within this study show only limited sequence divergence (mean sequence difference: 2.0 % (1.8-2.3 %) from specimens recently collected in Australia (GenBank: KR075719-KR075721)  [94] , indicating these associations are intraspecific and are still valid. Culicoides anophelis has previously been reported from southern India  [11, 12, 95]  and is widespread throughout southern Asia  [18]  possibly ranging as far east as New Guinea  [96] . The sequence identity of C. anophelis specimens collected in this study were concordant with the only available COI sequence for this species, also from southern India, and further study is required to investigate the relationship of populations of this species across its extensive range.

Black circles indicate median vectors (mv) that represent hypothetical missing or unsampled ancestral haplotypes. Number of nucleotide changes indicated on longer branches across southern Asia  [18, 97] , including Bangalore in southern India  [11] . This species is very similar morphologically to C. sumatrae Macfie, 1934  [18] , but there is no molecular sequence data currently available for C. sumatrae so we are not able to test the validity of these species. Similarly, comparisons between C. innoxius and other Indian species of the subgenus Hoffmania of Culicoides (for example those described by Majumdar et al.  [39] ), would help clarify the status of these species in India. Culicoides mesghalii and C. kepongensis are recorded for the first time in India and C. peliliouensis and C. similis for the first time in southern India, the latter having previously been recorded in West Bengal  [98]  and West Bengal and Jharkhand  [40] , respectively. This study provides the first sequence data (COI DNA barcode) for these species. Culicoides mesghalii is known to occur in the Saharo-Arabian region  [38] , C. peliliouensis in the Oriental region  [18, 97]  and C. similis from across the  Fig. 10  Box-and-whisker plots (left) and frequency distribution plot (right) of interspecific, i.e. closest non-conspecific (yellow) and intraspecific, i.e. the furthest intraspecific distance among its own species (red) pairwise genetic distances (uncorrected percentage sequence distances) across all species in this study.

The specimens within this study identified as C. similis are consistent with the description of this species given by Nandi & Mazumdar  [40] . The morphological description of C. similis by Nandi & Mazumdar  [40]  is, however, in contrast to that given for C. similis specimens from across the Afrotropical  [99, 100] , Saharo-Arabian  [38]  and Oriental  [18, 101]  regions. The specimens collected in this study have therefore tentatively been recorded as C. similis, however, the variation in diagnostic morphological characters for this species in the literature warrants further investigation to confirm the validity of this identification and whether the C. similis described by Nandi & Mazumdar  [40]  in fact represents a novel species or simply a morphological variant of C. similis. Culicoides peliliouensis is also considered to be morphologically similar to the Cambodian species C. pongsomiensis Chu, 1986  [18] . Collection of additional specimens and generation of DNA barcodes for the latter species would allow the exploration of the validity or potential synonymy of these taxa. The C. huffi specimens identified in this study are consistent with the morphological description of this species by Wirth & Hubert  [18] . Sequences differences [mean: 4.7 % range: 4.4-4.9 %)] were noted between C. huffi specimens collected in Karnataka and those collected in Tamil Nadu  (Fig. 4) . Variation has been noted in the morphological descriptions provided for C. huffi by Nandi & Mazumdar  [40]  and Wirth & Hubert  [18] , however further specimens are required to clarify the status of this species in India, and compare these with topotypic specimens from Thailand  [102] . Processing additional C. huffi specimens from a wider geographic area in India and specimens from morphologically similar species including C. palpisimilis  Wirth & Hubert, 1989  and C. similis  [18]  would further resolve the delineation of these species and aid in resolving their subgeneric placement. This study provides further evidence of the potential utility of DNA barcodes for species identification within Culicoides, and its potential to identify areas of potential cryptic diversity, which require further investigation, e.g. C. actoni  [92] . This utility is, however, proportional to the number of species represented within the reference  dataset and a strong integration with morphological taxonomy  [28] . Further DNA barcode data is also required across the full range of the Culicoides subgenera in order to test the 'barcode gap' hypothesis related to the definition of species boundaries with regard to intra-and inter-specific variation  [72] . The current subgeneric classification of the Culicoides  [103] , however, remains largely unvalidated (for review see Harrup et al.  [28] ) and there is mounting evidence to suggest that at least some of the current subgenera are polyphyletic, i.e. derived from more than one common ancestor  [104] [105] [106] [107] . The additional Avaritia subgenus species sequence data presented within this study, however, supports the monophyly of this subgenus within the context of the species included in the phylogenetic analysis with the Avaritia subgenus supported by BI as a monophyletic clade (100 % posterior probability). The UV LED-based light-suction traps tested in this study clearly outperformed the alternative green LED model in the number of Culicoides collected, with more than 16 times the number of individuals collected. Collections of C. brevitarsis, predicted to be underrepresented in UV-based light-suction trap collections based on previous studies in Australia  [31] , were in fact collected in greater numbers in the UV LED-based trap compared to the green LED-based trap, indicating that a UV-based trap is sufficiently sensitive to collect C. brevitarsis in southern India. Also of significant importance is the absence of key potential BTV vector species, including C. imicola and C. peregrinus, on multiple nights from green LED-based light-suction trap collections when these species are present on the corresponding night in the UV LED-based light-suction trap collection. If this were to occur during surveillance activities, the reduced sensitivity of the green LED-based light-suction traps would result in pseudo-absences within the Culicoides abundance dataset potentially resulting in epidemiologically significant errors in models of Culicoides seasonality and/or distribution. Ultraviolet LED-based light-suction traps, however, did collect a greater by-catch of other insects in comparison to green LED-based traps and hence incurred a greater handling time for each sample collected. While taking into account the limited spatial-scale and temporal duration of this comparison of green and UV wavelength-based light-suction traps the increased sensitivity of detection of the UV LED-based trap makes it the preferred choice for on-going surveillance efforts in India compared to a green LED-based light-suction trap. Ultraviolet-based light-suction traps have previously been recommended as the gold-standard for collecting Culicoides  [108] , based initially on the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute (OVI) trap design. Following on from the recommendations of Mellor et al.  [108] , multiple UVbased light-suction traps have been utilised for the collection of Culicoides including those based on conventional fluorescent UV bulbs and LEDs  [109, 110]  with the numbers of Culicoides collected by the traps roughly proportional to the intensity of the UV light emitted by the trap and the power of the fan. While the LED CDC type trap tested in this study has previously been found to be outperformed by CDC type traps fitted with a conventional fluorescent UV bulb  [109] , this variation is likely due to variation in the light intensity between the traps. However, the significantly lower power consumption and weight of the LED-based traps in comparison to currently available fluorescent bulb-based traps increases convenience for collectors and increases the number of nights of collections which can be completed on one battery charge from one to four nights when used with a ≥10 Ah battery and photo switch. The increased power efficiency of LED-based light-suction traps in comparison to conventional fluorescent UV bulb-based light-suction traps, such as the OVI, may assist in establishing Culicoides trapping schemes in areas where there are significant logistical challenges such as limited access, limited mains electricity availability, and financial constraints with regard to the purchasing of additional batteries  [35, 36] . A major consideration for establishing light-suction trapping networks is their limitations in reflecting the abundance and diversity of Culicoides feeding on ruminants. Diurnal activity has been reported in C. oxystoma  [111]  and C. actoni  [18]  indicating that any trap utilising light as an attractant has the potential to underestimate the abundance and distribution of these species in comparison to species with a principally crepuscular or nocturnal activity pattern. In addition, the preferential attraction to different light wavelength of the highly competent BTV vector C. fulvus, which is known from northern  [1, 5, 6] , but not southern India, remains unknown as it was not detected during this study. Further studies across different environments in this region would be useful in elucidating the distribution of this and other putative BTV vectors in this region. In addition, the continued expansion of the depth of the reference dataset of matched morphological and genetic data for Culicoides specimens from India and the surrounding regions is essential to enable accurate assessments of species abundance and diversity in relation to BTV epidemiology to be made in the future and will enable the Indian Culicoides fauna to be placed in a global context. 
 Conclusions This study provides the foundation of the production of an updated inventory of valid species of Culicoides known to occur in India. The study was developed via an integrative taxonomy approach supported by publically available molecular data, in addition to new molecular data produced to strict internationally accepted metadata and quality standards  [44, 112] . The study has examined the phylogenetics of Culicoides collected in southern India and placed results in context with both taxonomic status and the relatedness of global populations. The finding that morphological identification of potential vector species is relatively robust within this region has significant importance in interpreting previous studies of Culicoides carried out in southern India and in planning future studies. This taxonomic framework has the potential to be used to address a variety of areas where species-specific identification is important including relating the seasonality of adult populations to BTV outbreaks and in studies of vector capacity.

Transcriptome analysis revealed that a quorum sensing system regulates the transfer of the pAt megaplasmid in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.

The main pathogenic element of the bacteria is the tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid, a fragment of which, the T-DNA, is transferred from the bacteria to the plant cell upon infection (for reviews, see  [1] [2] [3] [4] ). The expression of T-DNA genes in the plant leads to the formation of the tumor and to the synthesis, by the tumor cells, of specific molecules, the opines. Opines are instrumental in the ecological niche constituted by the tumor  [5] . First, they are used as growth substrates by the tumorinducing Agrobacterium strains via the products of genes located on the Ti plasmid. Second, some of them also induce the conjugative transfer of the Ti plasmid (for reviews, see  [6, 7] ). In the A. tumefaciens reference strain C58 (genomospecies G8), the genome consists of two chromosomes, a circular one (ca. 2.8 Mbp) and a linear one (ca. 2.1 Mbp), plus an At plasmid (ca. 540 kbp) and a Ti plasmid (ca. 214 kbp  [8, 9] ). This latter plasmid bears most of the genetic determinants involved in the induction of plant tumors that are characterized by the presence of opines of the nopaline and agrocinopine families. Nopaline is an arginine derivative while the agrocinopines (A and B) are arabinose phosphate derivatives (for a review, see  [6] ). These last two opines induce the conjugative transfer of the C58 Ti plasmid in conjunction with a quorum sensing (QS) regulatory pathway  [10] [11] [12] [13] [14]  (for reviews, see  [7, 15] ). In bacteria, QS couples gene expression with bacterial cell concentration. It involves the production and sensing, by members of a bacterial population, of diffusible signals, the concentration of which mimics that of the bacterial cells. Once a threshold cell density is reached (i.e. a quorum), the concentration of the signals permits their perception and the subsequent activation or repression of the transcription of QS-regulated genes (for reviews, see  [16] [17] [18] ). In A. tumefaciens, the QS signal molecule that controls the conjugative transfer of the Ti plasmid belongs to the most common signal class in Proteobacteria, i.e. the N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) class; it is N-(3-oxo-octanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3O,C8-HSL;  [10, 12] ). AHLs are generally synthesized by the prodcucts of luxI and luxIlike genes (for reviews, see  [16] [17] [18] ). In strain C58, the genetic determinants involved in the conjugative transfer of Ti plasmid are induced by the agrocinopines, which bind the AccR regulator encoded by the accR gene (Additional file 1). This releases the repression of transcription of the accABCDEFG operon encoding the transport and degradation of the agrocinopines A and B. Bound to agrocinopines, the AccR regulator also derepresses the expression of the arc operon. Among the arc genes is traR, a member of the luxR family that encodes the QS regulator TraR. This latter regulator binds the QS signal molecule 3O,C8-HSL, dimerizes, and activates the transcription of the tra and trb operons involved in the conjugative transfer of the Ti plasmid, and to a lesser extent that of the rep operon involved in the replication of the Ti plasmid  [19]  (for reviews, see  [7, 20, 21] ). This complex regulatory system implies that C58 Ti plasmid conjugation can only occur at high donor cell density and in agrocinopine-rich environments, allowing the efficient dissemination of the main pathogenic element of the bacteria in tumors. In contrast with the wealth of data dealing with the Ti plasmid, little is known about the At plasmid in spite of the fact that it is often found in natural isolates of Agrobacterium spp. and can represent up to ca. 10 % of the bacterial genome. The At plasmid can sustain some large deletions (25 to 30 % of the plasmid size) that are associated with a significantly reduced carrying cost to the cell  [22] . Known functions of this plasmid are scarce. One is the utilization of gamma-butyrolactone and gamma hydroxy-butyrate via the products of the blcABC (also known as attKLM) operon  [23] . The last gene of this operon, blcC (aka attM) encodes the lactonase that hydrolyses gamma butyrolactone, as well as numerous QS signal molecules of the AHL class  [24] . The At plasmid also harbor genes involved in the degradation of Amadori compounds such as deoxyfructosyl-glutamate and deoxyfructosyl-glutamine, that are commonly found in decaying plant material  [25] . At plasmids are also conjugative plasmids. Sequence analyses of the C58 genome have revealed the occurrence of a type 4 secretion system (T4SS), termed AvhB, on pAtC58 that is highly similar to the VirB system of Bartonella henselae  [26] . The pAtC58 T4SS (T4SS pAt ) also shares some common traits with two previously identified T4SS of Agrobacterium, i.e. the one encoded by the virulence (vir) genes of the Ti plasmid (involved in T-DNA transfer to the plant cells and thus in disease induction) and the one encoded by the trb genes (T4SS pTi , involved in the conjugative transfer of this plasmid  [27] ). Interestingly, a recent study revealed that also the T4SS pAt of strain C58 is regulated by the master regulator AccR encoded by the Ti plasmid accR gene  [28] , a feature that favors the cotransfer of both Agrobacterium megaplasmids in the agrocinopine-rich environment of the tumor. Agrobacterium strain P4 was previously isolated from a plant rhizosphere  [29] . This strain exhibited the capacity to synthesize a QS signal of the AHL class. Strain P4 is non-pathogenic and in agreement with this, no Ti plasmid was observed following the complete sequencing of its genome  [30] . We report here the structure of the AHL produced by P4, we investigated the possibility that this AHL is indeed a QS signal and we identified the relevant determinants in QS. Moreover, we report the occurrence of a QS regulation of the expression of the T4SS pAt in strain P4. 
 Methods 
 Bacterial strains and growth conditions The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are described in  Table 1 . Agrobacterium strains were routinely cultivated at 28°C in modified Luria Bertani medium (LBm  [31] ), tryptone-yeast medium (TY: bactotryptone 5 g/L, yeast extract 3 g/L) or in Agrobacterium broth (AB) minimal medium  [32]  supplemented with ammonium chloride (1 g/L) and a carbon source (mannitol or glucose 2 g/L, for AB mannitol and AB glucose, respectively). When necessary, media were solidified using bacto-agar (Becton-Dickinson), 15 g/L. Escherichia coli cells were routinely cultivated at 37°C in LBm. Media were supplemented with appropriate antibiotics that were added at the following final concentrations: rifampicin 100 mg/L, streptomycin 250 mg/L, gentamicin 25 mg/L, carbenicillin 100 mg/L and ampicillin 50 mg/L. 
 Identification, extraction and determination of the structure of acyl-homoserine lactones Preliminary tests to evaluate the production of AHLs were performed essentially as described earlier  [33] . Aliquots of overnight culture supernatants, or 10 fold concentrated ethyl acetate extracts of culture supernatants of the assayed strains, were spotted onto TLC silica plate (Whatman ref. 4801-800). Both Chromobacterium violaceum strain CVO26  [34]  and Agrobacterium strain NT1(pZLR4)  [33]  were used as bio-indicators. When necessary, TLC plates were first submitted to chromatography in a methanol/water solvent system  (55/45; v/v) . For the determination of the structure of AHL, 500 mL of LBm medium inoculated with the P4 strain were centrifuged (10 min., 4000 g, 4°C) and the supernatant serially filtered on 1.8, 1.2 and 0.45 μm ultrafilters under vacuum. The filtered supernatant was extracted with ethyl acetate (v/v). Ethyl acetate was rotary evaporated to dryness at 30°C, and the extract resuspended in 100 % acetonitrile prior to UPLC MS/MS analysis. UPLC MS/MS was performed on a Waters Aquity UPLC-TQD apparatus driven by a MassLynx 4.1 software, and fitted with an Acquity HSS C18 column (2.1 mm × 50 mm; 1.8 μm). The temperature was set at 20°C and the solvent flow at 0.6 mL/min. The solvent composition is provided in Additional file 2. Mass spectrometry was performed by electrospay ionization. The triple quadrupole analyzer was used in both MS and MS/MS modes with a m/z mass ranging from 50 to 800. The most sensitive analytical conditions were first determined using synthetic N-(octanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (C8-HSL) and 3O,C8-HSL. Synthetic N-(3-hydroxy-octanoyl)-homoserine lactone (3OH,C8-HSL) was used as a standard in UPLC MS/MS analyses. 
 Gene sequence analyses Identification of ORFs, determination of gene organization and comparative genomic analyses of plasmids and chromosomal regions were performed at the NCBI web site (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi), MicroScope plateform (https://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/microscope/ home/index.php) and INRA AGMIAL  [35]  plateform (http://maiage.jouy.inra.fr/?q=fr/logiciels). In this latter case, the Artemis program was used. Sequence comparisons were performed using BLAST tools (blastn, blastp and tblastn) with default parameters. BLAST analyses were This strain is also a derivative of strain C58 achieved on both the non-redundant nucleotide sequence collection (nr/nt) and whole-genome shotgun contigs (WGS) databases. Prediction of functional domains was achieved using InterPro  [36] . Protein sequences were aligned using ClustalW  [37] . Phylogenetic trees based on protein sequence analysis were constructed using the Neighbor-Joining method implemented in MEGA program version 5  [38] . Bootstrapping was performed with 1,000 replicates to assess confidence on the nodes. 
 Cloning and mutagenesis Plasmid extractions were performed with the QIAprep® Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, GmbH). Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase (Thermo Scientific, GmbH), and T4 DNA polymerase (Eurobio, France) were used according to manufacturer's recommendations. PCR assays were performed in a final volume of 25 μL containing 1 X DNA polymerase buffer (provided by the manufacturer), dNTPs 2.5 mM, MgCl 2 2 mM, primers  (Table 2)  1 μM each, DNA polymerase 0.5 unit, and 1 μL of boiled bacterial suspensions. PCR conditions were 5 min at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1.5 min at 58°C, and 2 min at 94°C, and a final 10 min incubation at 75°C phase. To mutagenize cinI, the Gm cassette from plasmid p34S-Gm  [39]  was inserted at the unique XbaI restriction site of a pGEM®-T Easy vector (Promega France) harboring a ca. 800 bp region of the cinI gene obtained by PCR amplification (Additional file 3). The same cassette was also inserted at the unique SphI restriction site found in a 1240 bp non-coding region of plasmid At (located in between 36783 bp and 38021 bp coordinates), coordinates on pAt P4 with respect to the position of the first and last base amplified by the primer couples previously amplified and cloned into pGEM®-T Easy. The resulting plasmids, which are not replicative in Agrobacterium, were electroporated (2500 V, 125 Ω, 50 μF) into P4 and P4Rif strains. Double crossing-overs that led to a marker exchange were identified by carbenicillin sensivity and gentamicin resistance assays and verified by PCR using the appropriate primers. The cinI mutants and the pAt non-coding control mutant were named P4cinI and P4RifcinI (depending on the background) and P4RifNC, respectively. Another mutant harboring a deletion in the region cinR cinI cinX was generated by homologous recombination of a DNA fragment that consisted of a Gm-cassette surrounded by 375 bp of the 3′ end of the cinR gene and 336 bp of the 5′ end of the cinX gene (Additional file 3). This DNA fragment was synthesized and cloned into the pMA-T vector at the unique SfiI restriction site by the provider (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA). The resulting plasmid which is not replicative in Agrobacterium was electroporated (2500 V, 125 Ω, 50 μF) into the P4Rif strain. Double crossing-overs that led to a marker exchange were identified by carbenicillin sensitivity and gentamicin resistance assays and verified by PCR using appropriate primers. This mutant was named P4RifRIX. 
 Transcriptomic and RT-PCR analyses Overnight cultures of A. tumefaciens strains P4 and P4cinI were diluted to an OD 600nm = 0.1 in 50 mL AB mannitol. Cells were grown at 28°C up to an OD 600nm = 0.7 and harvested by centrifugation (15 min, 3500 g, 4°C). RNA was extracted using the NucleoSpin RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel Ltd., Oensingen, Switzerland) and further treated using RNase-free DNAse (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions to ensure the absence of any contaminating DNA. RNA concentration and purity were assessed using a nanodrop ND-100. RNA samples were used in transcriptomics, RT-PCR and RT-qPCR experiments. For transcriptomic analyses (performed at the high throughput sequencing platform of the Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell, Gif-sur-Yvette, France), RNA quality was re-evaluated on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, using an RNA 6000 pico kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA). Total mRNA were purified from 1 μg total RNA using Ribo-Zero rRNA (bacteria) removal kit (Epicentre, Madison, USA), according to the manufacturer recommendations. Directionnal RNA-seq libraries were constructed using ScriptSeq V2 RNA-seq library preparation kit (Epicentre, Madison, USA), according to the manufacturer's recommendations (with 14 PCR cycles). Library quality was assessed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, using an Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq 1000 instrument, with a TruSeq SR Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumina, San Diego, USA) and a TruSeq SBS v3-HS -50 cycles Kit (Illumina, San Diego, USA), using a Single Read 50 bp recipe. Libraries were pooled in equimolar proportions and diluted to a final concentration of 12pM, according to Illumina recommandations. The generated data were demultiplexed by the high throughput sequencing platform of the Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell (Gif-sur-Yvette, France) using CASAVA software suite (CASAVA-1.8.2; Illumina, San Diego, USA). The quality of the data was checked with the software FastQC 0.10.1 from Babraham Bioinformatics, Cambridge, UK). The Illumina 3′-adapter was trimmed using Cutadapt-1.2.1 (Python community), and only reads with a minimal length of 10 nucleotides were kept. After the trimming step, the data were mapped using TopHat2 (Center for Computational Biology, John Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA) with a seed length of 8 (default value) to the appropriate reference genome of P4 (including 3 scaffolds). Only unique reads were analyzed. Bam output files were sorted with Samtools (http://www.htslib.org/). HTSeq-count (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany) was used to evaluate the number of reads by gene or by CDS. The DESEQ package  [40]  was used to analyze the differential expression of genes between the reference strain P4 and the cinI mutant. Standard RT reactions were performed with 1 μg total RNA obtained as indicated above, using random hexamers as primers and the Revert Aid TM HM Inis First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-qPCRs were performed in a Lightcycler® 480 II (Roche) apparatus. The data were processed using the 2 -ΔΔCT method. For all primer sets  (Table 2) , the similarities of amplification efficiencies were controlled. The expression of the following 8 pAtP4 genes was investigated: avhB11, avhB5, traA, traG, cinR, cinI, cinX, and AGROTU_05920. The internal control used was the regulator gene blcR (Atu5136), also located on the At plasmid. 
 Measurement of bacterial doubling time Strains P4Rif and P4RifcinI were cultivated at 28°C during 40 h in AB mannitol and AB glucose and in the rich media LBm and TY. For each condition, five independent repeats were set up per strain. Bacterial growth was estimated by measuring the OD 600nm every 30 min using a Biosreen C microplate reader and according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Growth Curves USA, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Generation times were calculated based on the OD 600nm from graphical plots of the growth curves. The experiment was repeated 5 times. 
 Conjugation assays Conjugation assays were performed under in vitro conditions. Overnight cultures in LBm of donor and recipient cells were mixed at an equal cell density (i.e. ratio 1:1). Twenty μL of the mix were subcultured into 180 μL of AB mannitol and incubated in microplates at 28°C for 72 to 96 h with no shaking, if necessary in the presence of 100 nM AHL. Dilutions of these mixed cultures were spotted onto LBm agar media supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics to enumerate the different bacterial populations, i.e the donor, recipient, and At plasmid transconjugants. The verification of the presence of the At plasmid in a subset of randomly picked, putative transconjugants was performed by PCR with appropriate primers (  Table 2) . For each experiment, at least 8 independent repeat assays were performed, and the conjugation frequencies expressed per recipient cells. 
 Plant colonization under bacterial competition assays Tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum cv. F1 hybrid Dona, Vilmorin, France) were grown in a greenhouse under long day conditions (16 hours light), controlled temperature (24 to 25°C night and day), in an unsterilized horticultural soil and daily watered with unsterilized tap water. At the zero time point, the pots containing three-week old plants were soaked with the bacterial suspensions (strains P4RifNC and P4RifRIX mixed at an equal cell density, i.e. ratio 1:1; final OD 600nm = 0.1) until the maximum water retention capacity of the soils was reached. Nine plants were inoculated with the bacteria mixture and 3 samples consisting of 10 g of rhizospheric soil (defined as the soil fraction strongly adherent to the roots) were obtained at each time point, i.e. 1 day post inoculation (dpi), 7 dpi, and 21 dpi. The soil samples were resuspended in 30 mL sterile NaCl 0.8 % and vigorously vortexed for 30 s. Dilutions of these suspensions were plated onto AB mannitol agar supplemented with rifampicin and gentamicin to enumerate CFU after a 2 day incubation. PCR amplifications were performed using the appropriate primers  (Table 2)  to discriminate strain P4RifNC from P4RifRIX on a subset of 150 randomly picked, enumerated colonies per time point. 
 Results Agrobacterium strain P4 produced N-(3-hydroxy-octanoyl)homoserine lactone (3OH,C8-HSL) but not 3O,C8-HSL Strain P4 was identified as one of the environmental strains that activates a beta-galactosidase activity in A. tumefaciens strain NT1(pZLR4)  [29] , a QS bioindicator that responds to long chain AHLs  [41] . The production of short chain AHLs was assessed using the C. violaceum bio-indicator strain CVO26 and found to be undetectable. Ethyl acetate supernatant extracts were obtained from spent culture media of strain P4 and analyzed by TLC using synthetic AHL migration standards and the above mentioned bio-indicator NT1(pZLR4). Strain P4 produced a single AHL molecule spot as judged from the TLC plate, the Rf and shape of which suggested that it might be N-(3-hydroxy-octanoyl)homoserine lactone (3OH,C8-HSL). The presence, in the ethyl acetate extract of the only 3OH,C8-HSL signal molecule, that is not the common signal detected in other Agrobacterium strains  [33] , was confirmed (  Fig. 1)  using ultra-performance liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS) analysis. Strain P4 displayed a functional luxI-like gene (cinI) bordered by two luxR-like genes (cinR and cinX) Blast analysis of the genome of strain P4 revealed the occurrence of a single luxI-like gene that exhibited a 783 bp ORF and encoded a deduced 29.6 kDa protein. This protein consisted of 260 amino acids. The P4 luxIlike gene, that we termed cinI (see below), was PCRamplified, cloned into pGEM®-T easy and the production A B C D of AHL by the resulting strain was evaluated. The presence of the cloned cinI gene in E. coli conferred the ability to produce 3OH,C8-HSL. The proteins most related to the P4 LuxI-like protein were other deduced LuxI proteins from four Agrobacterium strains, namely A. tumefaciens strains 5A, RV3, and NCPPB 1641, and A. radiobacter strain DSM 30147  (Fig. 2a, b) . The P4 CinI protein was also related to the TraI protein of Agrobacterium strain C58 (32 % identity and 45 % similarity). Outside the Agrobacterium genus, the closest deduced protein was CinI from Rhizobium leguminosarum (57 % identity and 71 % similarity;  Fig. 2b ), hence the name cinI for the P4 luxI homologue. It is located on the At plasmid of strain P4 at coordinates 292 921 to 293 703. The Blast analysis was expanded to the right and left side of cinI to search for other possible component(s) of a QS regulatory system as their coding sequences are often located in the vicinity of luxI-like genes  [42] . This analysis revealed the presence to the left and right regions of cinI of two luxR-like determinants (AGROTU_05922 and AGROTU_05924;  Fig. 2a ) that were termed cinR and cinX, respectively. The putative protein CinR (ca. 30 kDa) consisted of 239 amino acids, while the putative CinX protein (27.8 kDa) consisted of 247 amino acids. Both CinR and CinX proteins exhibited the characteristic AHL-binding and DNA-binding domains  [43, 44] . The proteins most related to the P4 CinR protein were again the deduced LuxR proteins from A. radiobacter DSM 30147 and A. tumefaciens 5A, RV3, and NCPPB 1641. Outside the Agrobacterium clade, the proteins most related to the P4 CinR protein were those from Ochrobactrum rhizosphaerae SJY1 and Rhizobium etli with which P4 CinR shared 55 and 54 % identity and 73 and 69 % similarity, respectively  (Fig. 2c) . The P4 CinR protein was also related to the TraR protein of Agrobacterium strain C58 (22 % identity and 44 % similarity). The proteins most related to CinX were the LuxR-like proteins from the above mentioned Agrobacterium strains and, outside this clade, CinR from Sinorhizobium meliloti GVPV12 with which P4 CinX shared 39 % identity and 59 % similarity  (Fig. 2c) . CinR and CinX displayed only 29 % identity and 49 % similarity with each other and were therefore only distantly related. The exact same organization of the cinR cinI cinX region was found in data bases only in the four above mentioned Agrobacterium strains (i.e. 5A, RV3, NCPPB 1641, and DSM 30147;  Fig. 2a) . A related gene organization was observed in R. leguminosarum strain 3841. However in this later strain, cinX was absent and replaced by cinS  [45, 46] . 
 Transcriptome analysis revealed that cinI regulated the expression of genes involved in the transfer of the At plasmid in strain P4 The identification of a luxI-like gene involved in the synthesis of an AHL molecule and the presence of luxR-like genes that encode proteins with characteristic AHLbinding and DNA-binding domains on pAtP4, are clear indications that they most likely constitute QS regulatory elements. To identify genes potentially regulated by these QS elements, a cinI mutant was generated via the insertion of a gentamicin resistance cassette within cinI by homologous recombination  (Additional file 3) . The resulting strain, termed P4cinI, lost the ability to produce any detectable AHL signal, as judged from the analyses of spent culture supernatant and ethyl acetate extracts. RNA was extracted from both P4 and P4cinI strains during the exponential phase of growth, and used to perform transcriptome analyses. Only fold changes above 3 with a p-value lower than 5 10 −2 were considered significant. Using these parameters, 32 differentially expressed genes were identified (Additional file 4), all of them being upregulated in P4 when compared to P4cinI. Most of the genes, i.e. 29 out of 32, were located on the At plasmid of strain P4  (Fig. 3) . The remaining 3 genes were located on the circular (AGROTU_03028) and linear (AGROTU_05377 and AGROTU_05378) chromosomes. Gene AGROTU_03028 encodes a conserved hypothetical protein, AGROTU_05377 a hypothetical protein, and AGROTU_05378 a putative nucleotidyl transferase. On pAtP4, a first group of upregulated genes comprised the avhB genes plus the genes AGROTU_05875, AGROTU_05881 and atsE. This cluster was located between coordinates 241 317 and 252 681  (Fig. 3a) . It encompasses another gene, rctA, which did not appear to be differentially expressed in strains P4 and P4cinI. The pAt avhB genes of strain P4 were orthologs to those of pAtC58 that encode the T4SS pAt involved in the conjugative transfer of this plasmid  [26] . AGROTU_05875 encoded a partly deleted avhB5 gene. The two other genes, AGROTU_05881 and atsE, encoded a hypothetical protein and a hypothetical host attachment protein, respectively. A second group of upregulated genes was located between coordinates 314 321 and 325 085. It comprised the traA, traC, traD, traG gene cluster, plus four neighboring genes, namely AGROTU_05943, AGROTU_05944, AGROTU_05953 and riorf105  (Fig. 3b) . The four tra genes of strain pAtP4 are orthologs to the tra genes of pAtC58. These genes encode components of the DNA transfer and replication (Dtr) system that recognizes and cleaves at the origin of transfer (oriT) of plasmids  [26, 47] . The genes AGROTU_05943, AGROTU_05953 and riorf105 encoded hypothetical proteins with no predicted functional domains, whereas AGROTU_05944 encoded a putative plasmid stabilization protein. Two other genes, namely hipA2 and hipB2, located downstream of traA on pAtP4, were orthologous to respectively Atu5112 (hipA) and Atu5113 (hipB encoding a transcriptional regulator) of pAtC58. These genes were not overexpressed in P4 compared to P4cinI. The third group of upregulated genes was located between coordinates 285 182 and 294 410  (Fig. 3c) . Remarkably, this group of genes encompassed cinR, cinI and cinX, cinI being the most upregulated gene within this set of three. The other genes, sus and msi250, encoded hypothetical proteins, while AGROTU_05920 encoded a hypothetical protein with a metal-dependent hydrolase domain and msi287 a phosphate regulatory protein. The upregulation of a subset of 8 of the above mentioned pAtP4 genes (i.e. avhB11, avhB5, traA, traG, cinR, cinI, cinX, and AGROTU_05920) was confirmed in strains P4 and P4cinI by RT-qPCR (Additional file 4). CinI and 3OH,C8-HSL regulated the conjugative transfer of the pAt in strain P4 The above data strongly support the view that cinI and the associated 3OH,C8-HSL molecule controlled the conjugative transfer of the At plasmid of strain P4. To Panel a: the avhB cluster of pAtP4 with genes upregulated or not. The avhB cluster of pAtP4 was aligned with the avhB cluster of pAtC58 and compared with the trb cluster of pTiC58. C58 genes displaying significant similarity to avhB genes are marked with the same background pattern as used for the corresponding avhB gene of pAtP4. Panel b: the tra cluster of pAtP4 with genes upregulated or not. The tra cluster of pAtP4 was aligned with tra cluster of pAtC58. Up regulated and non-regulated genes are represented as indicated above. Panel c: the cinR cinI cinX genomic region with upregulated genes of the pAtP4. The cinR cinI cinX genomic region was aligned with the corresponding pAt region of A. radiobacter strain DSM 30147 and compared to the one of R. leguminosarum bv. viciae strain 3841. Up regulated and non-regulated genes are represented as indicated above validate this hypothesis, two P4 mutant strains were used as pAt donor strains in conjugation experiments: P4RifcinI that harbored a cinI gene disrupted by a gentamicin resistance cassette and P4RifNC that harbored the same gentamicin resistance cassette inserted in a noncoding region of the At plasmid (see Methods). Conjugations were performed with strain C58.00 as a recipient. The average pAt transfer frequencies (expressed per recipient cell) were 1.24 10 −4 in the cross P4RifNC x C58.00 and 8.9 10 −6 in the cross P4RifcinI x C58.00. These two values statistically differed (Kruskal-Wallis and post hoc Tuckey; p < 0.05;  Fig. 4 ). The transfer frequency of the At plasmid was therefore ca. 14 times higher for the strain carrying an intact cinI gene than it was for the strain with a mutated cinI gene. When 100 nM synthetic 3OH,C8-HSL were added in the media that supported the cross P4RifcinI x C58.00, the conjugation frequency was comparable to that observed in the cross P4RifNC x C58.00 (Kruskal-Wallis and post hoc Tuckey; p < 0.05;  Fig. 4 ). These results unambiguously demonstrated that cinI and the associated 3OH,C8-HSL signal control the transfer of the At plasmid in strain P4. The role of CinR and CinX was assessed using another mutant, P4RifRIX that carried a deletion of the cinR cinI cinX region replaced by the same gentamicin resistance cassette used to generate P4RifcinI and P4RifNC (see Additional file 3). This mutant was used as a pAt donor strains in conjugation experiments that involved strain C58.00 as a recipient. Crosses were performed either in the absence or in the presence of 100 nM synthetic 3OH,C8-HSL. The average pAt transfer frequencies (expressed per recipient cell) were 2.75 10 −6 in the cross performed in the absence of the AHL, and 2.91 10 −6 in the cross performed in the presence of the AHL, two values that do not statistically differ from each other (Kruskal-Wallis and post hoc Tuckey; p > 0.05;  Fig. 4 ). These results indicated that either CinR or CinX, or both, are essential for the detection of the AHL signal molecule. Quorum sensing regulation of the conjugation of the At plasmid did not confer a selective advantage in tomato plant rhizosphere To investigate whether the QS regulated transfer of the At plasmid may provide the host bacteria with a selective advantage, a series of experiments that involved various P4 mutant strains were performed. First, the consequences on bacterial growth of the mutation of the P4 gene cinI was evaluated in vitro, by comparing the generation time of strain P4Rif and P4RifcinI. In AB mannitol, generation times were 2.57 and 2.55 h, respectively. In AB glucose, they were 2.61 and 2.71 h, in LBm 1.74 and 1.96 h, and in TY broth 1.92 and 1.92 h, respectively. These experiments were repeated 5 times independently and the differences observed for each culture media were not significant (Mann and Whitney, p > 0.05). The relative fitness of strain P4 derivatives producing or not 3OH,C8-HSL was next evaluated in a competition experiment in a more ecologically-significant environment. To do so, and because P4 produces large amount of 3OH,C8HSL that can still be sensed by P4RifcinI, we used the cinR cinI cinX mutant described earlier. Tomato rhizospheres were inoculated by Agrobacterium strains P4RifRIX and P4RifNC at equal cell density and the colonization of the root system assessed at various times by enumeration from soil suspensions of the inoculated bacteria on AB mannitol supplemented by rifampicin and gentamicin. The results  (Fig. 5 ) did not revealed any fitness differences of the two competing strains. 
 Discussion This study led to the identification of the AHL molecule 3OH,C8-HSL produced by the avirulent Agrobacterium strain P4. The 3OH,C8-HSL signal is unusual among Agrobacteria but has been described as a QS signal in other systems (e.g. Burkholderia mallei  [48] ). In strain P4, several elements indicate that a QS system controlled the conjugative transfer of pAtP4. These are: (i), the production of 3OH,C8-HSL in P4 culture supernatants, a molecule that belongs to the AHL class of QS  Fig. 4  pAt conjugation efficiencies of strain P4 and related mutants. Crosses involved the pAt donor indicated on the x axis and strain C58.00 as a recipient. Conjugation frequencies (y axis) were expressed per recipient cells. A Kruskal-Wallis non parametric test and a post-hoc Tukey test were used to evaluate whether the observed differences were significant (p ≤ 0.05) or not (p > 0.05). Results are shown by the letters displayed above the graph signals; (ii), the presence of cinI, a luxI ortholog in strain P4 involved in the synthesis of the 3OH,C8-HSL signal; (iii), the occurrence of luxR orthologs that encoded proteins that possess characteristic AHL-and DNA-binding domains; and, (iv) the results of the transcriptome analysis and conjugation activities. Indeed, from the differential transcriptome analysis of strains P4 and a P4 mutant unable to synthesize the signal molecule, it appears that the wild type P4 strain expressed sets of pAtP4 genes involved in the conjugative transfer of this plasmid at a much higher level than the mutant did. In support of this, the conjugation frequency of the At plasmid of strain P4 was ca. 14 times higher in the wild type strain than it was in the mutant. As a whole, this work is the first identification of the occurrence of QS regulation in the conjugation of an At plasmid in Agrobacterium. A possibility exists, however, that a similar system has been identified, but not characterized, by other authors on a transmissible genetic element of Agrobacterium  [49] . Three sets of genes were upregulated in the wild type strain P4 (when compared with the mutant unable to produce the signal). The first set encoded the T4SS pAt involved in the formation of the conjugation apparatus in the donor bacteria, also termed the mating pair formation (Mpf ) complex  [50] . The genes and deduced proteins that encode or determine the T4SS pAt of strain P4 were highly related to those present on the At plasmid of strain C58. T4SS are indeed widespread among bacteria, where they ensure the transfer of protein(s) or nucleoprotein complexes outside the bacterial cell (for reviews, see  [51, 52] ). This is the case of the T4SS of A. tumefaciens, known as the Vir system, that promotes the transfer of a single strand copy of T-DNA from the bacteria to the plant cell  [53]  (for review, see  [2] ) and that of several plasmid conjugation systems such as those of the above mentioned pAt and pTi in strain C58 (for review, see  [52] ). The second set of upregulated genes encoded the DNA transfer and replication (Dtr) system, a protein complex also known as the relaxosome. The relaxosome recognizes and cleaves the nic site at the origin of transfer (oriT) of plasmids  [26, 47] . The oriT of pAt strain P4 has not been formally identified, but on pAtC58 the origin of transfer was previously located between the traA and traC genes  [26] . Considering the high relatedness of the sequences of traA, traC and their intergenic region, it is tempting to speculate that the oriT of pAtP4 may be located also here. Based on the similarity of the deduced protein sequences, pAtP4 traA, traC, traD might encode the relaxosome, while traG may encode the socalled coupling protein that bridges the relaxosome and its cognate T4SS  [54] . In the Rhizobiaceae, three Dtr systems have been identified among all species. The types I and II Dtr systems are found to be encoded by autotransferable plasmids, and the type III by mobilizable ones  [55] . It has been proposed that class I Dtr systems such as the one encoded by the pTiC58 tra genes, are regulated by QS while class II Dtr sytems, including the one encoded by the pAtC58 tra genes, are regulated by an RctA repressor associated with an RctB anti-activator  [55, 56] . Interestingly, the organization of the four tra genes of pAtP4 did not reveal the presence of traF and traB orthologs downstream of traA, a key feature of type I Dtr systems. The absence of traF and traB orthologs on pAtP4 would therefore place the pAtP4 Dtr system amongst type II systems regulated by RctA, especially considering that a rctA ortholog, but no rctB ortholog, is present on pAtP4  (Fig. 3) . The present study however demonstrated that the pAtP4 type II Dtr system was regulated in a luxI/luxR dependent fashion. This finding therefore indicated that type II Dtr systems could also be regulated by QS, contrarily to what has been suggested earlier  [55] . We propose that two subclasses of type II Dtr systems exist: a first one regulated by RctA and RctB (e.g. on pAtC58), and a second by RctA and QS (e.g. on pAtP4). In agreement with this, a similar situation (presence of the QS genes, presence of the repressor gene rctA and absence of the rctB gene) was found on the At plasmid of Agrobacterium strain 5A (not shown) that could therefore also belong to the second class of Type II Dtr systems. In relation with the above, genes encoding components of a QS regulatory system have been detected on pAtP4 among those upregulated in the wild type P4 strain with respect to the mutant. The gene cluster structure is quite unusual, as it consisted of a single luxI-like gene surrounded by two luxR-like genes. This organization appears to be unique in the bacterial world, and found only in Agrobacterium strains (P4, 5A, RV3, NCPPB 1641 and DSM 30147). Interestingly, strains P4 and 5A belong to the same A. tumefaciens genomospecies 1 and have been isolated in different experiments performed with a soil of the same origin (X. Nesme, personal communication). Besides the molecular genetics of pAt conjugation, the reported data tackled some ecological aspects of the phenomenon. A recent report indicated that the At plasmid confers a competitive advantage upon the host strain in the rhizosphere but exhibits a high cost under carbon-limiting conditions  [22] . Therefore, we investigated whether the ability to transfer the plasmid also favors or hampers bacterial growth in the rhizosphere environment. No fitness differences were observed under the experimental conditions we used between strains P4RifRIX and P4RifNC  (Fig. 5) . From the above, it is reasonable to conclude that the QS-regulation of the conjugative transfer of pAtP4 did not confer a selective advantage upon the plasmid host in the tomato rhizosphere, at least under our experimental conditions. 
 Conclusion This study led to the identification of novel conjugation system in which QS regulates plasmid transfer. However, contrary to what is observed for the conjugation of the Ti plasmid, the QS regulation of pAt transfer was not stringent (i.e. it was not a ""on/off switch""), a feature that suggests that additional regulatory components may exist. The ecological and evolutionary relevance of the QS control of plasmid conjugation is still open to debate  [21] . Although such a regulatory process might be necessary to prevent a futile mobilization of the donor metabolic resources required for the conjugative transfer of a replicon (that can represent, in the case of the At plasmid, ca. 10 % of its genome) when the donor population is low, QS regulation does not allow the donor to sense whether putative recipients are present. In relation to this, it has been suggested that QS regulation of plasmid conjugation may serve as a way to detect a presence of a biofilm rather than to evaluate a cell density  [57] . This suggestion can be related to the diffusion sensing concept described by Redfield  [58] . Both hypotheses propose that QS would permit the biological phenomenon, here the conjugative transfer of Ti and At plasmids, to occur only or preferentially in confined environments. Another report suggested that QS regulation of plasmid conjugation may be a way to switch the bacterial behavior from plasmid donor at high cell density to recipient at low cell density  [59] . This elegant proposal is based on the existence of genes encoding a plasmid exclusion entry system that relies upon two Trb proteins (TrbJ and TrbK) encoded by the corresponding trb genes of Ti plasmids. Interestingly pAtP4, as well as pAtC58, do not harbor trbJ and trbK orthologs. The ecological relevance of QS regulation of the pAtP4 conjugative transfer therefore remains, to some extent, unclear.

New processes have been designed to separate valuable maize fractions before or after distillation. The grain can be primarily separated into germ (which will yield food-grade, high-value oil), bran and endosperm, which is subjected to distillation. Because fats and fibre are removed in the early steps of the process, protein is concentrated in the final distillers dried grain, called high protein distillers grain (HPDG)  (Kelzer et al., 2011; Hoffman et al., 2010) . 
 Reduced fat DDGS The extraction of maize oil from distillers dried grain is less costly than direct extraction from the grain. It produces an oil unsuitable for food and feed but usable for biodiesel, as well as reduced fat DDGS  (US EPA, 2010; Hoffman et al., 2010) . 
 Whisky distillery In some whisky distilleries, the mash is filtered after the liquefaction step, producing wort and a solid by-product called draff or distillers spent grain. The wort undergoes further fermentation while the draff is dried or pressed before being fed to animals. The alcohol-free effluent that remains at the bottom of the distillation column is called spent wash or spent lees. This product, that contains enzymes and yeast, can be dried to yield dried distillers solubles. It can also be centrifuged so that the solids can be further dried into distillers concentrate. As in ethanol production, the spent grains are often mixed with the solubles, resulting in distillers dark grain  (Lyons, 2003; Crawshaw, 2004; Göhl, 1982) . It is important to note that whiskies are often the result of the distillation of blended grains that may include maize, wheat, barley and rye. The by-products are therefore not corn distillers grain in the strict sense. Single malt whisky is usually made from barley (and sometimes rye), but not from maize  (Crawshaw, 2004) . 
 Environmental impact Energy costs Drying distillers grain and solubles is an energy consuming process: 40.4% of the thermal energy used in an ethanol plant that produces DDGS can be used in the drying process. However, wet distillers grain spoils quickly and the dried form is preferable in spite of high energy costs: 63% of DGS produced by the US dry-milling ethanol industry are sold dried (US EPA, 2010). 
 Volatile organic compounds Drying distillers grain produces volatile organic compounds that may cause serious health problems. These emissions can be reduced (up to 95%) by the installation of thermal oxidizers in ethanol plants  (US EPA, 2011) . 
 Industrial waste reduction Corn distillers grain fed to livestock remove huge amounts of by-products that would otherwise have to be eliminated by other means  (Lyons, 2003) . 
 Reduction of methane emissions Corn distillers grain is a more efficient ingredient than maize grain in cattle and has been shown to decrease methane produced from enteric fermentation when they replace it. This reduction has been estimated at 3.2 g CO 2 eq/MJ ethanol per head of cattle fed DGS (US EPA, 2010). Genetically modified maize by-products Corn distillers grain is mainly produced in the USA and may result from processing of genetically modified maize (in 2005, datasheet citation  Heuzé V., Tran G., Sauvant D., Noblet J., Renaudeau D., Bastianelli D., Lessire M., Lebas F., 2015 . Corn distillers grain. Feedipedia, a programme by INRA, CIRAD, AFZ and FAO. http://www.feedipedia.org/node/71 Last updated on  May 11, 2015, 14:32  English corrected by Tim Smith (Animal Science consultant) and Hélène Thiollet (AFZ) Image credits  Valerie  Heuzé / AFZ about 50% of maize acreage in the USA was sown with transgenic plants)  (Fernandez-Cornejo et al., 2006) . The European Union used to be the main export market and imported more than 90% of US maize DDGS every year between 1995 and 2000. As a result of the de facto moratorium on the approval of new genetically modified varieties and the following introduction of new labeling and traceability requirements for animal feed in 2004, exports of US corn distillers grain to the EU decreased by  80% between 2005 80% between and 2008 80% between (Fox, 2008   
 Nutritional attributes Maize distillery by-products are the result of the extraction of starch from the maize grain, and tend to concentrate the other nutrients, notably protein, fibre, soluble sugars and oil. Concentrations of these nutrients may be up to 3 times higher than in the grain  (Pedersen et al., 2007) . 
 Variability As noted in Processes, variations in the inclusion of solubles, extraction (or not) of oil, and technical innovations in fermentation and fractionation result in DDGS that contains more (or less) protein, energy, fat, fibre and phosphorus  (Rausch et al., 2006; Kelzer et al., 2010) . The composition of maize DDGS is therefore extremely variable, depending on the ethanol plant  (Spiehs et al., 2002) . It is actually difficult to provide a typical composition for DDGS, because, unlike most industrial byproducts, its composition is not driven by the rate of extraction of a single end product (such as starch, sugar or oil) but depends on multiple factors. The following table presents the proximal composition of several groups of DDGS (data collected by AFZ and the University of Minnesota).   (Fastinger et al., 2006) . 
 Variation Heat damage, which causes protein unavailability, can be assessed by the amount of acid detergent insoluble nitrogen (ADIN), though the threshold associated to performance depression is not known precisely. Colour is a more practical indicator: properly heated distillers grain has a honey golden to caramelized golden colour; a darker, coffee-like colour is an indicator of excessive heating and potential protein damage  (Schroeder, 2010) . 
 Fats Corn distillers grain contains variable amounts of oil (2-15%). Corn distillers grain that have been subjected to oil extraction seems to have a fat content about 3-5% DM (or less) while other corn distillers grain can contain 10% (or more) fat  (Feedipedia, 2010) . The relatively high unsaturated fat content of corn distillers grain may restrict their inclusion rate in ruminant diets  (Carvalho et al., 2005) . 
 Fiber Corn distillers grain is not particularly rich in cell walls: in maize-based ethanol DDGS produced between the years 2000 and 2010, crude fibre content was 7.5 ± 1.5% DM (5.3-14.8), ADF content was 13.4 ± 4.6% DM (5.2-26.9) and NDF content was 35.2 ± 8.0% DM (22.5-58.1). The lignin content was fairly low (3.9 ± 1.8% DM), which explains the high digestibility of NDF of corn distillers grain in ruminants. Residual starch is low (less than 8% DM) for ethanol DDGS and the new biofuel processes seem more efficient than the ones used for alcoholic beverage production  (Feedipedia, 2011 , University of Minnesota, 2010  phosphorus contents slightly higher with W/DDGS. If a W/DDGS product contains substantially more fat (e.g. more than 15%) and/or phosphorus (e.g. more than 1.0%), it is very likely that more than normal amounts of distillers solubles were blended with the distillers grain, or that the processor had problems with separation of materials during the handling of solubles  (Schingoethe, 2006) . 
 Potential constraints Sulphate toxicity Due to the use of sulphuric acid in the process, ethanol by-products may be high in sulphate (0.5-1.7% DM)  (McAloon et al., 2000) , which increases the risk of sulphur toxicity in livestock fed large amounts of distillers grain. A high concentration of H 2 S inhibits the oxidative processes in nervous tissue and results in a central nervous system disorder called polioencephalomalacia, which may affect up to 6% of cattle fed diets containing more than 0.56 % sulphur  (Gould, 1998; Vanness et al., 2009 ). 
 Mycotoxins Maize is susceptible to fungal infections producing mycotoxins, including aflatoxin, fumonisins, deoxynivalenol (vomitoxin), ochratoxin, T2 toxin and zearalenone. Due to the concentration that non-starch components undergo during the distillery process, mycotoxin concentrations are about three-fold in corn distillers grain compared to the original grain. It is thus of utmost importance that maize intended for bio-ethanol production be free of mycotoxins before processing. There are also ways to alleviate mycotoxin problems, such as removing damaged grains before they enter the process (Keshun  Liu, 2011) . Chemical treatments (NaOH, NH 4 OH, H 2 O 2, NaClO, CH 2 OH) have been investigated to detoxify mycotoxins in stillage  (Bennett et al., 1981; Lillehoj et al., 1979) . 
 Copper Certain traditional whisky distilleries use copper rather than stainless steel, for stills and pipework, and their by-products tend to contain high levels of copper, which is toxic to sheep. Maize distillers dark grain, for instance, may contain between 15 and 120 mg/kg of copper. While copper content and biological copper availability are highly variable in whisky by-products, it is essential to check copper levels before buying such products if they are to be fed to sheep  (Lewis, 2002) . Copper is not an issue in industrial ethanol production. ruminants Maize distillery by-products are common ingredients for ruminants. In a forage and concentrate diet, DDGS can often replace most, if not all, of the protein supplement such as soybean meal and a significant amount of the grain  (Schroeder, 2010) . One particular benefit of DDGS over cereal grains is that, as their energy is primarily provided as readily digestible fibre and fat, they have a propensity to alleviate incidence and severity of acidosis, laminitis and fatty liver caused by rumen starch fermentation  (Kelzer et al., 2011; Schroeder, 2010) . Wet and dried distillers grain are equivalent, but if the diet also contains moist feeds, such as maize silage, gut fill may limit total DM intake and production with diets that contain more than 20% of DM as wet DGS  (Schingoethe, 2006) . 
 Palatability Dried DGS are palatable, and palatability may only become a problem with excess wet or dried DG in the diet  (Schroeder, 2010) . 
 Digestibility and energy content The average OM digestibility was 73.5 ± 6.2% (6 samples collected from literature) which corresponds to a mean ME content of 12.6 MJ/kg DM  (Feedipedia, 2011; Woods et al., 2003) . This value is similar to the values of 12.6 and 12.7 MJ/kg DM proposed respectively by INRA  (Sauvant et al., 2004)  and NRC  (NRC, 2001) . Recent research in the USA suggests a much higher digestibility, about 85%, which corresponds to ME values of 14.6 to 15.9 MJ/kg DM. Wet DGS contained approximately 14.0 MJ/kg of ME and 9.5 MJ/kg of NEL, i.e. 10 to 15% more energy than published before  (Birkelo et al., 2004) . This could reflect either digestive interactions or a higher energy value for distillers grain obtained by recent processes, and notably those produced in bioethanol plants. In sacco studies suggest that effective DM degradability of DDGS is higher than those of rapeseed meal and cottonseed meal, but lower than those of barley grain and beet pulp  (Woods et al., 2003; Chapoutot et al., 2010) . 
 Protein value and phosphorus Since most of the degradable proteins in maize grain have been degraded during the fermentation process, the proteins in maize DDGS contains a higher by-pass fraction than that of the original grain. Values for rumen undegradability of protein (RUP) vary from 47% to 76%, with a mean value of 55% (44% in  Sauvant et al., 2004 )  (Firkins et al., 1984; Woods et al., 2003; Kleinschmit et al., 2006a) . If RUP values are quite high (e.g. more than 80%), it may be advisable to check for heat damaged, undigestible protein  (Schroeder, 2010) . Apparent small intestinal digestibility of DDGS (90%) appears to be lower than that of soybean meal and groundnut meal (96%) and higher than that of rapeseed meal (82%) and cottonseed meal (81%)  (Yue Qun et al., 2007) . The INRA-AFZ tables  (Sauvant et al., 2004)  propose a similar ranking of those ingredients. When DDGS are included at high levels in the diet, other protein supplements may be needed because poor protein quality (lysine) and high phosphorus concentration become factors to consider  (Schroeder, 2010) . 
 Comparison with other concentrate ingredients Distillers grain is estimated to have 120-150% of the energy value of dry-rolled maize grain in beef finishing diets, and this difference decreases as dietary DGS increases  (Kononoff et al., 2006) . However, the feeding value of DGS appears to be lower in finishing diets based on steam-flaked maize than in diets based on dry-rolled or high-moisture maize  (Klopfenstein et al., 2008) . In feedlot steers, including 15% maize DDG or sorghum DDG in steam-flaked maize-based diets did not affect apparent total tract digestibility  (May et al., 2010) . Dried DGS can effectively supplement barley-based beef cattle diets up to almost 20% of diet DM  (Eun et al., 2009 ). Feeding wet distillers grains with solubles (WDGS) and wet corn gluten feed together reduces some of the negative effects of feeding WDGS alone on nutrient digestion, purine derivative excretion, and N utilization in dairy cows  (Gehman et al., 2010a) . With regard to protein, maize DDGS contain less protein than wheat DDGS but the protein of the latter is less degradable  (Nuez-Ortin et al., 2010) . A recent study with nylon bags incubated in the rumen suggested that the amino-acid availability of several distillers grain products is comparable with that of soybean products  (Mjoun et al., 2010) . 
 Dairy cattle Since the 1990s, numerous experiments have been carried out with corn distiller grain in dairy cow rations. Dried DG(S) is mainly used as a protein supplement, and milk production response to DDG(S) was either unaffected  (Clark et al., 1993; Owen et al., 1991)  or increased  (Powers et al., 1995; Nichols et al., 1998) . Dairy rations can be successfully formulated to include 15% (diet DM) of maize distillery by-products (DDGS or high-protein DDG) while maintaining or increasing DM intake, milk production, and yields of milk components  (Kelzer et al., 2009) . Balanced diets for dairy cattle can include up to 25% WDGS and result in increased microbial protein synthesis, milk production, and milk protein yield  (Gehman et al., 2010b) . As a rule, a maximum of 20% (diet DM) distillers grain should be included in the ration. At higher levels, potential palatability and excessive protein consumption problems often exist, though amounts may approach 30 % when diets are properly formulated  (Schroeder, 2010) . Dried DG was also a good energy source for dairy cows when the diet contained approximately 28% NDF and 5% fatty acids  (Leonardi et al., 2005) . Higher production was observed when cows were fed either wet or dried DGS than when fed the control diet . Similar milk production was observed for wet and dried maize DGS but maize DGS resulted in a higher milk production than sorghum DGS  (Al-Suwaiegh et al., 2002) . Milk composition is usually not affected by feeding DGS when feeding sufficient amounts of forage fibre. Some field reports and publications reported instances of milk fat depression when diets contained more than 10% (diet DM) of wet DGS  (Hutjens, 2004; Cyriac et al., 2005 , Kleinschmit et al., 2006b . However, a meta-analysis of 24 studies conducted between 1982 and 2005, involving 98 treatment comparisons, showed that there were no decreases in milk fat content when diets contained wet or dried DGS up to a level of 40% of DM intake  (Kalscheur, 2005) . Corn distillers solubles (CDS) are usually blended with the distillers grain before drying to produce DGS, but the solubles may be fed separately. In lactating cows fed wet (28% DM) condensed corn distillers solubles (CCDS) at 0, 5, and 10% (diet DM), milk production increased when fed the CCDS (34.1, 35.5 and 35.8 kg/d for 0, 5, and 10% CCDS diets), although milk fat content (3.54, 3.33, and 3.43% respectively) was slightly lower and milk protein content (2.93, 2.97 and 2.95% respectively) was unaffected by the diets (da  Cruz et al., 2005) . Dairy cows could be fed as much as 20% of the total ration DM as CCDS (4% added fat from the CCDS) with no apparent adverse affects on DM intake or milk composition  (Sasikala-Appukuttan et al., 2006) . CCDS supplementation improves nutrient availability and use of low-quality forages  (Gilbery et al., 2006) . 
 Beef cattle Beef cattle have been successfully fed as much as 40% (diet DM) of wet or dried DGS without affecting meat tenderness or palatability  (Roeber et al., 2005) . Growing cattle fed moderate levels (15% diet DM) of DDGS had similar growth performance and carcass characteristics to animals fed the control diet  (Depenbusch et al., 2009) . In growing and finishing beef cattle, wet and dried DGS resulted in similar performances . Interactions were observed between maize grain processing (dry rolling, high moisture and steam-flaking) and the inclusion rate of WDGS. These interactions could be due to the decreased rumen ratio of acetate/propionate in dry-rolled maize and high-moisture maize diet with 40% WDGS  (Corrigan et al., 2009b) . Feeding strategies of steers aimed at increasing rumen pH may improve digestion of DDGS in steam-flaked maize-based finishing diets  (Uwituze et al., 2010) . In steers, apparent total tract digestibility of DDG was negatively affected by association with processed (dry-rolled or steam-flaked) maize grain  (May et al., 2009 ). Dried DGS may be similar to tallow and high-moisture maize grain in finishing diets containing 20% DDGS. The greater energy value of WDGS compared with maize grain may be due to higher propionate production, higher fat digestibility, and more unsaturated fatty acids reaching the duodenum ). The level of condensed distillers solubles (CDS) may affect the performance of growing steers as CDS depressed average daily gain and gain/feed. There was no obvious explanation for the interaction between DDG supplementation and the CDS level on growing steer performance  (Corrigan et al., 2009a) . 
 Sheep and goats Dried DGS is a viable supplement to enhance the nutrition of sheep consuming moderate-quality forages  (Archibèque et al., 2008) . DDGS achieved higher average daily gains and lower feed costs per kg gain compared to lambs on a control diet  (Iliev et al., 2008) . In growing lambs, DDGS included at 20% (diet DM) could replace a mixture of barley grain and rapeseed meal without adversely affecting average daily gain and carcass characteristics. Including triticale DDGS also improved the fatty acid profile of subcutaneous fat  (McKeown et al., 2010) . 
 Pigs The availability of maize DDGS has increased tremendously since the 1990s, offering opportunities for use in pig nutrition. Maize DDGS is a source of both energy and protein and can partly replace cereal grains and protein-rich ingredients in pig diets as long as the diet amino-acid balance is correct (by supplementation of industrial amino-acids for instance). 
 Energy values and digestibility The gross energy of maize DDGS averages 22.7 MJ/kg DM with an average digestibility of 76% in growing pigs; the DE and ME values are then equivalent to 17.2 MJ and 6.1 MJ/ kg of DM respectively  (Pedersen et al., 2007) . The corresponding energy values in adult pigs are about 6% higher. The NE values of maize DDGS can be calculated from ME values using a NE/ME ratio of 0.6. Despite the high dietary fibre content of maize DDGS, its DE and ME values are slightly higher than those of maize grain while the NE value of DDGS is markedly lower (9.6 vs. 13.0 MJ/kg DM). 
 Protein and phosphorus Maize DDGS is a source of protein but their amino acid balance is poor with relatively low contents of lysine and tryptophan. The digestibility of most amino acids in maize DDGS is about 10 percentage points lower than those of maize grain, lysine digestibility being the lowest (-20 percentage points) and the most variable. Maize DDGS can be a source of phosphorus with a rather high availability (60%,  Pedersen et al., 2007) . 
 Recommendations Most reports in the literature show that piglets, growing-finishing pigs and sows can tolerate rather high inclusion rates of maize datasheet citation DDGS with no marked degradation of their performance as long as the amino acid supply is maintained  (Stein et al., 2009 ). However, reduced feed intakes are observed when feed intake and appetite are limiting factors of performance (piglets and lactating sows). The lower palatability and the high dietary fibre content of maize DDGS can then depress feed intake at high inclusion rates in the diet. In practice, a 20% inclusion rate is recommended in piglets, growing-finishing pigs and lactating sows diets. Higher levels (up to 50%) can be fed to pregnant sows without detrimental effects on performance. Such diets can also contribute to improve the welfare of restrictively fed pregnant sows  (Stein et al., 2009) . Finishing pigs can tolerate higher inclusion levels, but the high level of unsaturation of fat in maize DDGS combined with a high fat content in most maize DDGS induce rather soft body fat, which is unsuitable for processing and carcass conservation. Some authors even suggest totally removing maize DDGS from the diet over the last 2-3 weeks before slaughter in order to reduce the unsaturated fatty acids concentrations in body fat. 
 Poultry Dried distillers grain with solubles is a valuable resource for poultry nutrition. The high fibre content of DDGS compared to maize grain is compensated by higher protein and fat contents, leading to comparable ME levels  (Cozannet et al., 2010) . However, the variability of ME is quite high, due to different technological processes, and to the severity of heating during processing: dark (over-heated) samples tend to have a lower energy value than light ones  (Fastinger et al., 2006) . Energy is also higher in cockerels than in young chicks  (Skiba et al., 2009; Cozannet et al., 2010) . Dried DGS protein has a high protein content that makes it valuable for poultry nutrition. The amino acid profile is slightly less favorable than that of maize, especially for lysine, methionine and cysteine. Moreover, amino acid digestibility is lower than in maize especially for cystine, lysine and threonine  (Fastinger et al., 2006) . The technological origin of the DDGS has an effect on lysine in particular because this amino acid can be damaged during processing. As for energy, darker samples seem to have lower lysine digestibility  (Batal et al., 2006) , especially in young animals  (Adedokun et al., 2008) . Overall, amino acid contents and digestibility can be variable and using digestible amino acids in feed formulation is beneficial. Broilers DDGS is used efficiently by broilers at inclusion rates below 20%  (Wang et al., 2007a; Wang et al., 2007c; Wang et al., 2008b) . However, some authors reported a reduction of broiler growth performance and/or feed efficiency at rates such as 18%  (Lumpkins et al., 2004)  or 25% and above  (Wang et al., 2007a; Wang et al., 2007b) . There are some reports of decreased performance when 9 or 12% DDGS were included in the diet  (Shalash et al., 2009; Skiba et al., 2009)  while in other cases levels as high as 24% did not impair animal performance  (Shim et al., 2011) . This may be due to the variable quality of DDGS and to the formulation of the experimental diets. Comparison of DDGS samples differing in quality (darkness) showed that dark samples led to lower growth performance, with a high correlation (R=0.74) between luminance value and weight gain  (Cromwell et al., 1993) . High inclusion rates (30%) can also lead to problems of pellet quality that could explain lower performance  (Wang et al., 2008a) . Meat quality does not seem to be affected by DDGS in diets  (Corzo et al., 2009 ) except at high inclusion rates that may lead to a higher content in unsaturated fatty acids in the meat, which is a nutritional advantage but may represent an increased risk of lipid oxidation . In conclusion, optimal inclusion rates are 6% in starters and 12 to 15% in growers and finishers  (Lumpkins et al., 2004) . These levels can be increased to 20% and above for good quality (light) DDGS when the diet is nutritionally balanced with a particular care for the level of digestible lysine. 
 Layers In layers, DDGS was tested successfully at inclusion rates up to 25%  (Masa'deh et al., 2008) . Feed consumption, egg production and quality were not affected while yolk color increased with DDGS inclusion. Rates as high as 32% were also tested without effect on performance in a trial where a 16% inclusion rate improved performance compared to the control. The quality of eggs (Haugh index, consumer preference) was improved by DDGS addition . In contrast, some experiments reported a slight decrease in egg production at inclusion rate above 10%  (Roberson et al., 1985; Shalash et al., 2010 ). An optimal inclusion rate of 15% can be suggested. Higher rates can probably be used with high quality DDGS, provided that the feed is well formulated. 
 Turkeys In turkeys, some reduction in performance has been observed at high inclusion rates but 10% DDGS in growers/finishers seems to be safe  (Roberson, 2003) . 
 Ducks In male ducks, inclusion of 12% DDGS in the diet did not decrease performance from 5 to 12 weeks  (Peillod et al., 2010) . Higher rates (up to 24%) lowered performance in young animals but had no significant effects on the whole period. Recommendation could be 10 to 15% DDGS in young ducks and up to 20% in older animals. 
 Rabbits In rabbit nutrition, the two main advantages of corn distillers grain are their high protein content and high digestible energy content (the latter due to the lipids)  (Villamide et al., 1989) . The main disadvantage of corn distillers grain for rabbit feeding is their insufficient fibre content. The ADF and lignin of corn distillers grain are below the fibre requirements for rabbits, which are 17-19% and 5.0-5.5% respectively  (Gidenne et al., 2010) . Another issue is that the protein is only moderately digestible in rabbits, about 70%  (Villamide et al., 1989)  to be compared for instance to the protein digestibility of soybean meal (80-85%) and peas (85%). In addition, the protein of corn distillers grain is lysine-deficient and just able to cover sulphur amino acids and threonine requirements  (Villamide et al., 2010; de Blas et al., 2010) . For these reasons, even if it is possible to include corn distillers grain up to 50% in an experimental feed  (Villamide et al., 1989) , typical inclusion rates in rabbit diets are in the 2-5% range  (Oriani et al., 1997; Chrastinova et al., 2010) , and a maximum level of 10% for least-cost formulation seems reasonable  (Lebas, 2011) .

Protein and amino acids 

In regular DDGS, 
some types are richer (30-35% DM) than others (25-30% DM). The production of DDGS includes a drying step that may 
damage amino acids, notably lysine. Lysine content of the protein is particularly low: 2.1-2.8% of the protein  
 ). Distillers grain with or without solubles 

The composition of W/DDG and W/DDGS are very similar. The protein content may be slightly lower and the fat and

The by-product, safflower meal, is mostly used as a protein ingredient for animal feeding. Dehulling improves crushing efficiency, but the hardness of the seed coat and the extreme softness of the kernel make the operation costly and only economically viable if there is a market for hulls  (GRDC, 2010; Smith, 1996) . High-protein meals containing more than 40% protein can be obtained by sifting the regular meal and removing hull fragments  (Alvarez-Gonzalez et al., 2007) . The quality of safflower meal is highly variable as it depends on the amount of hulls and on the extent of oil extraction. 
 Safflower hulls The hulls may be used in potting mixtures for plant nurseries, to make packing and insulation materials, and as filler for bricks  (Oyen et al., 2007) . As a feedstuff, they are unpalatable, reduce gain, and can constitute only a small part of the roughage requirement  (Göhl, 1982  Nutritional attributes Seeds Safflower seeds from a worldwide collection of accessions contained 28.3 ± 4.5% oil and 17.5 ± 1.8% protein (DM basis) (Li  Gajue et al., 1993) . Seeds contain a high percentage of hull (about 45%), which hampers their use in animal feeding  (Hertrampf et al., 2000) . 
 Oil meal The value of safflower oil meal depends on the process. Oil content varies from 1% for solvent-extracted meals to 15% for those mechanically extracted. Protein content is about 20-25% in the undecorticated meal but can be over 40% in decorticated meals  (Dajue et al., 1996; Göhl, 1982) . Crude fibre content is about 30-40% for undecorticated meal and can be as low as 10% in the dehulled meal  (GRDC, 2010) . When compared to soybean meal, the quality of safflower protein for monogastric feeding is low due to its deficiency in lysine, methionine and isoleucine coupled with the low availability of these amino acids  (Darroch, 1990) . Safflower meal is an excellent source of P, and a good source of Zn and Fe  (Gowda et al., 2004) . It contains 3.5 times more Fe than soybean meal. Its vitamin profile is poorer than that of other oilseed meals, but it is a good source of biotin, riboflavin and niacin relative to soybean meal  (Darroch, 1990) . 
 Hulls Hulls contain about 60% crude fibre and 21% lignin  (Hertrampf et al., 2000) . 
 Potential constraints The protein fraction of the meal contains two phenolic glucosides, the bitter-flavoured matairesinol-β-glucoside and the purgative 2-hydroxyarctiin-β-glucoside. They can be removed by extraction with water or methanol, by the addition of βglucosidase  (Darroch, 1990) , or by a combination of physical and enzymatic treatments (Jin et al., 2010). 
 Ruminants 
 Safflower meal Undecorticated safflower meal can be used in ruminant rations as a protein source, as a replacement for soybean meal, cottonseed meal or linseed meal, if used on an isonitrogenous basis and if adequate energy is supplied  (Kohler et al., 1965) . When high levels of safflower meal are included in ruminant diets, lower performances have been observed  (Walker, 2006) . 
 Palatability Safflower meal is slightly bitter and less palatable than other common ingredients  (Smith, 1996) . However, its palatability is variable and it may be readily eaten by ruminants when mixed with other feeds  (Göhl, 1982) . Early trials in the 1950s and 1960s showed that sometimes it presented palatability problems with beef cattle but that dairy cows found it palatable  (Smith, 1996) . Safflower meal was palatable and well accepted when fed to rams  (Sudhamayee et al., 2004) . 
 Digestibility Undecorticated safflower meal has a low in vivo digestibility in ruminants, but its in vitro digestibility value is equal to that of sunflower meal  (Chandrasekharaiah et al., 2002) . The in vivo OM digestibility was about 45% (calculated from  Dixon et al., 2003a) , with a ratio of 0.60 or 0.70 when compared to barley or linseed meal respectively. It provides less energy than soybean meal, sunflower meal, rapeseed meal and cotton meal, due of its high fibre content  (Walker, 2006) . The OM digestibility of decorticated safflower meal was found to be much higher (68%)  (Goss et al., 1954) . 
 Protein value Safflower meal is reported to have a highly degradable protein  (Walli, 2005) , though it is less degradable than that of groundnut meal  (Sudhamayee et al., 2005) . Only few values are given in the literature for protein degradability: it varied between 60%, with a ratio of 0.90 or 1.16 when compared to rapeseed meal or soybean meal respectively  (Chandrasekharaiah et al., 2001) , and 70%, with a ratio of 1.16 when compared to linseed meal  (Dixon et al., 2003a) . Safflower meal is a poorer source of protein than groundnut meal, due to its lower digestibility and lower nitrogen retention  (Sudhamayee et al., 2004) . 
 Dairy cows Past research has shown safflower meal to be a valuable ingredient for dairy cows, with no noticeable effect on flavour or odour of milk produced. It was a good substitute to linseed meal for instance  (Smith, 1996) . Adding 1 kg of safflower meal in the rations of dairy cows increased milk yield and milk fat and the substitution of 1 kg of concentrate by similar amount of safflower meal gave similar results  (Juknevicius et al., 2005) . With low-producing Friesian cows and buffaloes (less than 10 kg milk/d), 3.75 kg of safflower meal successfully replaced 3 kg of undecorticated cottonseed oil meal, and slightly increased milk fat content  (El-Shinnawy et al., 1979) . 
 Beef cattle Most of the research concerning the use of safflower meal in beef cattle was done in the USA before the 1960s. when safflower meal was fed at low amounts  (Smith, 1996) . In wheat silage rations for steers (285 kg BW), inclusion of safflower meal in compound feed at 18 and 35% in the diet had no adverse effect on feed intake and feed palatability, and resulted in an average daily gain of more than 1.4 kg/d  (Voicu et al., 2009 ). 
 Sheep In young sheep rations based on low quality grass hay or cereal straw, supplementation with safflower meal gave higher liveweight gains and increased wool growth more than a barley/urea supplement  (Dixon et al., 2003a; Dixon et al., 2003b) . In hayfed lambs (18 kg BW), adding 350 g/day of concentrate mix with 25% safflower meal resulted in an improvement of intake, digestibility, feed efficiency and body weight gain  (Dessie et al., 2010 ). 
 Safflower seeds Safflower seeds are less palatable than other common oilseeds. Whole safflower seeds can be fed to beef cattle without processing. Due to their fibre content, higher levels of safflower seeds in the diet can result in lower animal performance. The maximum inclusion rate for safflower seeds is 1.1 kg/cow/d  (Walker, 2006 ). 
 Safflower hulls The incorporation of safflower hulls in cattle rations lead to a reduction of feed efficiency because of their low digestibility, but growth is not impaired when adequate energy and protein are supplied by other sources. Safflower hulls are used to provide bulk in high grain rations for beef cattle  (Kohler et al., 1965) . 
 Pigs Safflower meal is not a very suitable feed for pigs. The protein quality is low due to its deficiency in essential amino acids. Undecorticated meals are not usable by pigs due to their excessive fibre content  (Williams et al., 1973; Darroch, 1990) . Decortication improves the nutritional value of the safflower meal for pigs. 
 Weanling pigs Feeding safflower meal to weanling pigs or pigs weighing less than 45 kg is not recommended  (Chiba, 2001) . 
 Growing pigs Dehulled safflower meal is usable for grower-finisher pigs, but only when supplemented with a protein source rich in lysine. Up to 12% safflower meal can be included in the diet if the lysine requirement is met  (Darroch, 1990) . It has been suggested that safflower meal should not provide more than 5 to 10% or 12.5% of the supplementary protein in the diet  (Chiba, 2001) . Feeding growing pigs (20 to 80 kg) with a diet containing 17% of decorticated safflower meal reduced growth and increased carcass fatness. Addition of lysine resulted in a small increase of performance but results were still lower than those obtained with soybean meal or fish meal supplements  (Williams et al., 1973) . Finisher female pigs fed diets containing safflower meal and supplemented with amino acids had a reduced growth. A small increase was observed when the safflower meal diet was supplemented with fish meal instead of lysine and methionine  (Williams et al., 1974) . 
 Sows Dehulled safflower meal can be included at up to 15% in the diet of pregnant sows, but it should be limited to very low levels for lactating sows  (Darroch, 1990) . 
 Poultry Due to their very high fibre content, safflower seeds and undecorticated safflower meal are of low value to poultry  (Kohler et al., 1965) . However, partial or total dehulling, associated with appropriate feed formulation, can enable the use of safflower products in poultry. 
 Safflower meal The use of decorticated safflower is possible in poultry diets if the energy level is adjusted, with a special care to lysine and methionine supplementation. Recommended inclusion levels are lower for young birds (5-8%) than for older broilers and hens (10-15%). Safflower seeds can be safely included in broiler and layer diets at a 10% level. As safflower meal does not appear to show toxicity, these levels can be extended in the context of less intensive production, but it is advised not to do so without supplementing the diet with other protein sources or amino acids. The extent of the dehulling process has direct consequences on the value of safflower meal. A complete dehulling resulted in a meal with a crude fibre content as low as 2.4% while partial dehulling left 10 to 15% crude fibre, resulting in a reduction of metabolizable energy of 25%  (Farran et al., 2010) . The energy value also varies with the type of animals: ME was found to be much higher (8.9 vs. 5.4 MJ/kg) in hens than in chicks  (Petersen et al., 1976) . Similarly, a comparison between young and older turkeys showed a 30% difference in ME  (Halloran et al., 1973) . Digestibility of proteins and amino acids increased with dehulling and was comparable to that of soybean meal for fully decorticated and extruded safflower meal  (Farran et al., 2010) . Growth performance can be similar to control treatments (generally soybean meal/maize grain diets) if the diets are supplemented with appropriate levels of potentially limiting amino acids. For example, up to 22% dehulled safflower meal maintained growth in broilers when lysine was added, while unsupplemented diets almost halved the rate of gain  (Mohan et al., 1984) . However, a 30% inclusion rate led to reduced growth even with lysine supplementation. Poor growth and problems of beak pasting at very high levels of safflower meals were reported by  Ramana-Rao et al., 1971 . Dehulled safflower meal was also efficiently used in pullets when lysine and methionine were added  (Wylie et al., 1972) . Some studies reported that it is possible to maintain broiler performance with undecorticated safflower meal using iso-energetic diets, but this requires expensive energy sources to supplement the diet, such as high levels of fat (more than 10% in the experiment conducted by  Thomas et al., 1983 ). 
 Safflower seeds In broilers, full fat safflower seeds have been tested at levels up to 20% in diets where energy and protein were adjusted. Seeds have the advantage of providing more energy than safflower meal. In this study growth performance and carcass traits were not affected; only blood cholesterol was significantly decreased  (  Image credits Maia C Thistle-Garden effect was not significant  (Hosseini-Vashan et al., 2008a) . In similar trial, inclusion of safflower seeds in the diet induced changes in the fatty acid composition of yolks, in particular an increase in linoleic acid  (Hosseini-Vashan et al., 2008b) . 
 Pet birds Safflower seeds are often used as birdseed especially for members of the parrot family and pigeons. They are a common alternative to sunflower seeds. The bird feed industry prefers to use white hull and normal hull types of safflower seeds rather than striped types  (Emongor, 2010) . 
 Rabbits Safflower seeds Extruded safflower seeds (3 F extruder -123°C) introduced at 33.8% in the diet (50% sun-cured alfalfa meal), resulted in a milk production (measured by weight of kits at 3 weeks) and a young growth rate (at 8 weeks) similar to those obtained with the control diet (alfalfa and soybean meal)  (Johnston et al., 1985) . 
 Safflower meal Safflower meal included at 60% in the diet (replacing entirely sun-cured alfalfa meal) resulted in a milk production (measured by weight of kits at 3 weeks) and a young growth rate (at 8 weeks) similar to those obtained with the control diet  (Harris et al., 1980) . In Mexico, safflower production was particularly important during the late 1970s  (FAO, 2011) , and standard and dehulled local safflower meal (pasta de cártamo) were extensively used in rabbit feeds in place of imported soybean meal  (Lebas, 1981) . 
 Fish Due to their high fibre content, safflower seeds and safflower oil meal are not very good ingredients for fish. Only partially dehulled or fully dehulled safflower meal should be used. It should be avoided in starter and grower feeds, and fed to herbivorous and omnivorous fish rather than to carnivorous ones. Safflower meal should be included at a maximum rate of 5-7%, and lysine and methione supplementation is required  (Hertrampf et al., 2000) . 
 Salmonids In California, during the late 1950s and 1960s, a commercial company studied pelleted feeds based on dehulled safflower meal (42% protein) to feed trout. The pellets were palatable to the fish, but resulted in a lower performance than pellets made from less fibrous ingredients and the market never developed. Japanese fish farms used safflower meal regularly in the 1960s and 1970s, employing both non-dehulled and dehulled safflower meal as fillers at less than 5% inclusion rate in the diet  (Smith, 1996) . 
 Carp (Cyprinus carpio) In an experiment in India, carp fed a diet based on pelleted safflower meal had better growth than those fed natural fish food organisms and conventional fish feed. Water quality and proximate composition of fish flesh were similar  (Nagaraj et al., 1990) . 
 Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) In tilapia fed high-protein or low-protein safflower meal, protein digestibility of the diets was higher than for the control diet, but final weight and total length of tilapia were lower  (Alvarez-Gonzalez et al., 2007) . 
 Crustaceans While the high amounts of fibre contained in safflower meal should make it unsuitable for crustacean feeds  (Hertrampf et al., 2000) , a series of trials with shrimps have shown that safflower meal, and particularly high-protein ones, can be an economic alternative to soybean meal, fish meals and cereal-based ingredients  (Galicia-Gonzalez et al., 2010) . In whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei), whole seeds were found to be unsuitable for shrimp diets due to their low protein and high fibre contents  (Galicia-Gonzalez et al., 2010) . However, high-protein safflower meal can totally replace soybean meal and up to 66% of the protein from fish meal in the diet, without having adverse effects on juvenile shrimp growth or feed utilization  (Galicia-Gonzalez et al., 2008) . In diets containing 30% safflower products, apparent DM digestibilities of low-protein and high-protein safflower meals were 48% and 52% respectively, similar to those reported for other ingredients such as maize grain or cottonseed meal. Apparent protein digestibility was high (72-89%) (Galicia-Gonzalez et al., 2010). The asterisk * indicates that the average value was obtained by an equation.

 Feed categories Fruits and by-products Plant products and by-products Related feed(s) Tomato seed cake Tomato leaves and crop residues Tomato fruits Description Tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) are one of the major vegetables and second only to potatoes in terms of world production  (FAO, 2011) . While the majority of tomatoes are sold fresh, a little more than one third of the production is processed for canning, tomato juice, tomato paste or puree, sauces and ketchup (click here to see a diagram of Tomato processing). Tomato processing yields the following by-products, which represent 5-13% of the whole tomato  (Ventura et al., 2009; del Valle et al., 2007; NRC, 1983; Göhl, 1982) : Datasheet citation Heuzé V., Tran G., Hassoun P., Bastianelli D., Lebas F., 2015. Tomato pomace, tomato skins and tomato seeds. Feedipedia, a programme by INRA, CIRAD, AFZ and FAO. http://www.feedipedia.org/node/689 Last updated on  October 13, 2015, 9:55  English correction by Tim Smith (Animal Science consultant) and Hélène Thiollet (AFZ) Image credits Valérie Heuzé / AFZ Premium Pet Foods World tomato production was 152 million tons in 2009. The main tomato producers were China, the USA, India, Turkey, Egypt, Italy, Iran, Spain, Brazil and Mexico (75% of the world production)  (FAO, 2011) . More than a third of this production is grown for the processing industry, which makes tomatoes the world's leading vegetable for processing  (Tomato News, 2010) . In 2007, tomato wastes were estimated to be 11 million tons, including a little more than 4 million tons of tomato pomace  (FAO, 2011; Tomato News, 2010) . The production of tomato pomace is seasonal and linked to the harvest period. Most of the product is available in the late warm-season and drying or ensiling is necessary for storage  (Weiss et al., 1997) . Tomato pomace and other tomato byproducts are usually found in the vicinity of tomato processing plants, though dried tomato pomace is also exported. 
 Processes Tomato pomace and skins are high-moisture products: often more than 80% moisture and it can be up to 98%  (NRC, 1983) . They spoil very quickly, in less than 2 days in some cases  (Caluya, 2000) . Unless they can be fed immediately to livestock, they must be preserved either by drying or by ensiling. 
 Drying Due to the high moisture content, artificial drying can be expensive and sun drying is preferable. The product should be dried until it is crispy. Once dried, tomato pomace should be ground and the dried product mixed thoroughly with the diet  (Caluya et al., 2003) . 
 Silage Tomato processing by-products should not be ensiled alone. Their water content generates large quantities of effluents  (Barroso et al., 2005)  and pH does not decrease sufficiently for good preservation  (Hadjipanayiotou, 1994) . Consequently, it is recommended that a a dry material such as straw be added to absorb part of the juice  (Barroso et al., 2005) . When fresh tomato pulp (15.5% DM) is mixed with 5 or 10% wheat straw on a fresh basis, the end product, after 90 days, is a well preserved and fermented silage  (Ziaei et al., 2010) . In the Phillipines,  Caluya et al., 2003  recommended mixing the fresh tomato pomace with chopped wilted grasses or a roughage, such as rice straw or maize stover, in plastic containers, or, alternatively, to pack the materials layer by layer (pomace then chopped grasses, etc.). The mixture should be approximately 69% pomace and 31% dry grass and the silage is ready after 14 days. 
 Environmental impact Waste reduction Fresh tomato by-products have been considered an environmental nuisance for a long time  (Rabak, 1917) . In some countries, the waste is dumped in waterbodies near the factory or left to accumulate on the site of production. The material spoils quickly, emits a very foul odour and provides a breeding place for a variety of pests such as flies and mosquitoes, which are hosts of disease-causing organisms  (Caluya et al., 2003) . Feeding animals with tomato by-products is, therefore, a valuable way to prevent environmental contamination (del  Valle et al., 2006; Caluya et al., 2003) . 
 GM tomatoes Genetically modified tomatoes containing a gene preventing the accumulation of polygalacturonase, an enzyme involved in the ripening process, were released in the mid-1990s, first as fresh fruits and then as tomato paste. These products were eventually commercial failures and, after an initial success, the GM tomato paste was removed from the market in 1999. In 2011, no GM tomatoes were commercially available  (Bruening et al., 2000; GMO Compass, 2006   
 Nutritional attributes Tomato by-products are highly heterogenous products. Their physical form, chemical composition and subsequent nutritional value depend on the relative proportions of peels, seeds and other remaining materials left by the various steps of the process, which themselves depend on the targeted tomato product. For instance, the crude protein and fat content of tomato pomace varies with the amount of seeds, which are richer in protein and fat than the peels  (Denek et al., 2006) . Tomato processing technologies and tomato products are also continuously evolving to meet market demands  (Gasa et al., 1991; Knoblich et al., 2005; del Valle et al., 2006) . The common names of the product (pomace, pulp, skins, seeds, waste, etc.) may be misleading and only a chemical analysis of the main nutrients (at least protein, fat and fibre) can give a proper idea of the nutritional value of a given batch. 
 Tomato pomace Tomato pomace is relatively rich in protein (17-22% DM) and fat (10-15% DM) (Feedipedia, 2011). Fat content can even exceed 20% if the seed proportion is high  (Battaglini et al., 1978) . Fibre content is high: crude fibre is in the 33-57% DM range. NDF (50-72% DM) consists largely of ADF (39-60%) (Feedipedia, 2011). Lignin content (ADL 20-30% DM; Feedipedia, 2011) is extremely important though some tomato pomaces containing less than 7% ADL in the DM have been described  (Gasa et al., 1989; Fondevila et al., 1994) . 
 Tomato skins Tomato skins have a lower protein and fat content, and a higher fibre content than pomace  (Battaglini et al., 1978; Knoblich et al., 2005) . When NaOH is added to improve the efficiency of the mechanical peeling process, tomato skins have a very high Na content (can be more than 8% DM), which may limit the use of tomato skins in animal feeding. The high Na content must be taken into account in feed formulation. However, it is possible that NaOH treatment improves the nutritional value of tomato skins  (Cotte, 2000) . Tomato skins also contain appreciable amounts of carotenoids (about 500 mg/kg DM), mostly in the form of lycopene  (Knoblich et al., 2005) . 
 Tomato seeds Tomato seeds have a high protein (25-28% DM), fibre (54% ADF) and fat (20-24% DM) content  (El Boushy et al., 2000; Persia et al., 2003) . A tomato seed by-product containing a lower amount of fat is either misnamed or is actually a defatted seed meal or cake. 
 Potential constraints Tannins Tomato pomace and skins contain tannins, which may limit their use for monogastrics  (Kavitha et al., 2005) . 
 Tomatine Unripe tomatoes and the green parts of ripe tomatoes contain tomatine, a solanine-like alkaloid (saponin) that may be toxic to insects, dogs, and to a lesser extent to herbivores, causing diarrhoea, vomiting and intestinal irritation. However, tomatine disappears as the tomato ripens and is not a problem in tomato pomace  (Milner et al., 2011; Straney, 1998) . Tomatine may have medicinal properties such as antibiotic, anticancer, anti-cholesterol, anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive and antipyretic e ects  (Milner et al., 2011) . 
 Pesticide residues Tomato by-products may be contaminated with chemicals such as insecticides, weed killer, etc.  (Campos et al., 2007) . The skins are directly exposed to these chemicals and pomace is thus prone to contamination. Maximum residue limits for food and feed are fully described in the Codex Alimentarius (Codex Alimentarius, 2011). 
 Ruminants Tomato by-products are usually fed to ruminants due to their high fibre content. They are not excellent feed ingredients, being less digestible than most major oil meal and protein sources. They can be bitter and should be used together with more palatable feeds. However, they can be a valuable and cost-effective source of protein, energy and fibre  (Göhl, 1982; Caluya et al., 2003) . In the Phillipines,  Caluya et al., 2003 recommended  including tomato pomace at up to 50% of the daily roughage requirement irrespective of whether it was fresh, dried or ensiled. The pomace should be given before the roughage or mixed (particularly when dry) thoroughly with chopped roughage. 
 Digestibility and energy values In vivo OM digestibility of dried tomato pomace was estimated at 56% in sheep, using a balanced diet containing 34% pomace. In sacco rumen DM degradability was 48%  (Abbeddou et al., 2011) . A value of 62% for OM digestibility was obtained using the gas test method. Extremely wide estimates of ME have been obtained, depending on the method (in vitro, in sacco) and equation used, ranging from 4.9  (Chumpawadee et al., 2007) , 7 and 9  (Gasa et al., 1991; Abbeddou et al., 2011)  In sacco protein degradability of dried tomato pomace in the rumen is quite high, from 65-70%  (Chumpawadee, 2009; Abbeddou et al., 2011)  to 76-78% (Ben  Salem et al., 2008; Valizadeh et al., 2009) . However, most of the protein is not digestible in the rumen but in the intestine  (Gasa et al., 1988; Gasa et al., 1991 , Ventura et al., 2009 , probably because an important fraction of this crude protein is acid-detergent insoluble  (Weiss et al., 1997; Ventura et al., 2009 ). 
 Fresh or ensiled tomato pomace 
 Dairy cows Tomato pomace ensiled with whole maize plant at up to 12% (DM basis) showed good preservation characteristics. Dairy cows fed this silage had the same DM intake (3.74% BW), milk yield (35 kg/d) and milk composition as cows fed maize silage alone  (Weiss et al., 1997) . 
 Sheep In lambs, fresh tomato pomace replaced more than 75% of poor quality hay (6% protein and 43% OM digestibility), resulting in higher OM intake and OM digestibility  (Ojeda et al., 2001) . Fresh tomato pomace ensiled with 10%  (Denek et al., 2006) , or 15% straw  (Barroso et al., 2008 ) on a DM basis, was well preserved. When offered as sole forage to 43 kg Awassi rams  (Denek et al., 2006)  or 47 kg Segureña ewes  (Barroso et al., 2008) , for maintenance, DM intake was 0.95 kg/d  (Denek et al., 2006)  and 1.7 kg/d  (Barroso et al., 2008)  with a little daily weight gain of 50 g/d  (Barroso et al., 2008) . It can be concluded that fresh tomato pomace ensiled with straw can be a good quality roughage for sheep, particularly during periods of forage scarcity  (Denek et al., 2006) . Ensiled tomato pomace (20% DM) can be fed to castrated lambs (43.5 kg) at up to 45% of the diet DM and replace maize silage without modifying total DM intake (91.7 g/kg W 0.75 ). However, OM digestibility of the diet significantly increased at up to 30% replacement but not beyond  (Campos et al., 2007) . 
 Dried tomato pomace 
 Dairy cows In dairy cows in early lactation (41 kg milk/d), dried tomato pomace included at 10% of the diet DM did not change DM intake, milk yield and milk composition  (Safari et al., 2007) . In multiparous dairy cows (26 kg milk/d) dried tomato pomace was included at up to 32.5% of the concentrate DM, replacing part of barley grain and whole cottonseed meal without any adverse effect on health, milk yield and DM intake  (Belibasakis, 1990) . 
 Beef cattle and growing cattle In beef heifers, dried tomato pomace completely replaced urea-treated straw, improving rumen digestion and feed efficiency. DM intake increased from 66 (straw only) to 121 g DM/kg BW 0.75 (70% pomace) and decreased slightly (97 g DM/kg BW 0.75 ) when pomace was fed alone  (Yuangklang et al., 2006) . In Brahman-Thai steers (188 kg), dried tomato pomace was included at 50% of the diet DM in a total mixed ration without any problem. Diet DM intake (103 g/kg BW 0.75 ) was comparable to that obtained with other by-products (brewers grains, palm kernel meal and soybean meal) included at the same amount in the diet ). In adult steers (370 kg) fed for 21 days a total mixed ration where dried tomato pomace replaced cassava chips (up to 11% of diet DM), there were no significant changes in DM intake and nutrient digestibility (OM, protein and fibre)  (Yuangklang et al., 2010a) . In two-year-old Brahman steers (258 kg) fed for 120 days, the replacement of cassava by tomato pomace tended to reduce daily weight gain (from 1037 to 881 g/d), but differences were not significant  (Yuangklang et al., 2010b) . 
 Sheep In adult rams, a diet containing dried tomato pomace and alfalfa hay in a 1:1 ratio resulted in digestibility of DM, OM and crude protein being 57, 59 and 57% respectively. An addition of yeast (4 g/d) significantly increased digestibility up to 68, 67 and 66% respectively  (Paryad et al., 2009 ). In growing lambs (18 kg), an experiment compared ad libitum straw-based diets supplemented with 500 g concentrate (control), or with 250 or 125 g concentrate and feed blocks containing wheat bran, salt, minerals and 48% (DM) of dried tomato pulp. DM intake of the feed blocks + 125 g concentrate was higher than for the other treatments. The DM intake of feed blocks increased (37.5 to 48.7 g/kg W 0.75 ) when the DM intake of offered concentrate decreased (23.1 to 11.9 g/kg W 0.75 ). Growth with the feed block was not significantly different from that of lambs fed straw and concentrate. Growth tended to decrease (57 to 48.7 g/d) when the concentrate offered decreased (Ben  Salem et al., 2008) . In fattening lambs fed an alfalfa hay-based diet, dried tomato pomace included at up to 75% decreased OM digestibility from 66% to 57% respectively. Daily weight gain was highest (132 g/d) at a 50% inclusion rate, which was, therefore, the maximum recommended rate  (Ibrahem et al., 1983) . Young growing lambs (15.6 kg) fed for 6 weeks on a barley-based diet with 200 g/kg DM of dried tomato pomace had a similar N retention and growth performance (304 vs. 337 g/d) as lambs fed on a diet containing the same level of protein from soybean meal  (Fondevila et al., 1994) . In growing sheep (6-7 months old, 32.6 kg), dried tomato pomace replacing 50 or 75% of sunflower meal protein significantly decreased DM, crude protein and crude fibre digestibility and it was concluded that 12.5% was the maximum replacement rate for dietary protein  (Mohamed et al., 1997) . 
 Goats In goats fed Napier grass ad libitum for 21 days, dried tomato pomace replaced 25 to 100% of soybean meal offered at 1.5% BW without changing forage intake (0.535 kg DM/d), concentrate intake and N utilization  (Yuangklang et al., 2007) . 
 Pigs While tomato wastes have been described as potentially useful for non-ruminants  (Gupta, 1988) , there is scarce information concerning the use of tomato pomace, skins and seeds in pig feeding. 
 Fresh tomato pomace In the Phillipines, fresh tomato pomace was found to have potential as a supplementary feed for grower and finisher pigs. Feeding growing pigs with 6% fresh tomato pomace significantly increased feed consumption compared to those fed a commercial mash. Furthermore, feed cost per kg gain was reduced. Including 35% fresh pomace in the diet of finishing pigs resulted in a significantly higher final weight, total weight gain, average daily gain and feed consumption. Feed efficiency was comparable to those fed commercial mash and feed cost per kg gain was significantly decreased with increasing levels of fresh tomato pomace . 
 Dried tomato pomace In growing pigs fed isonitrogenous diets containing 4 and 8% dry tomato pulp with or without enzymes, nutrient digestibility (DM, OM, protein and crude fibre) was significantly reduced with an 8% inclusion rate compared to 4%. Adding a mixed enzyme preparation (amylase, protease, cellulase) to the rations containing 8% tomato pulp resulted in increasing DM and crude fibre digestibility to the levels of the 4% tomato pulp diet, but not the OM and protein digestibility  (Imamidou et al., 1999) . In growing and fattening pigs fed maize-based diets, the simultaneous inclusion of by-products of tomato, grape and pepper (2% inclusion rate of each, replacing in total about 10% of the maize grain of the control diet) did not have any negative effects on performance and health  (Cilev et al., 2007) . 
 Poultry Dried tomato pomace Dried tomato pomace can be used in poultry feeds, but its high fibre limits the metabolizable energy (ME) content to 8.4-9.5 MJ/kg  (Kavitha et al., 2005; Lira et al., 2011)  and thus its practical use in poultry feed formulation. 
 Broilers Inclusion of dried tomato pomace in broiler diets is possible if taking into account its low energy value in feed formulation. A lower feed intake has occasionally been observed in young animals, which is probably due more to the higher fibre content than to a low palatability, since older animals can consume diets with high pomace levels  (Lira et al., 2010) . However, growth performance and feed efficiency have been depressed even at low inclusion rates in some instances (3% in starters to 9% in finishers;  Tabeidian et al., 2011) . Increasing inclusion rates from 5 to 20% decreased performance linearly with a relatively small (6%) overall decrease in body weight at 20% inclusion rate. Young animals were more affected, and birds older than 28 days did not show a lower growth when 20% pomace was included in the diet  (Lira et al., 2010) . Carcass characteristics do not appear to be negatively influenced by dried tomato pomace  (Lira et al., 2010) . The lycopene content could actually be an advantage, especially in hot climates, due to its antioxidant properties (in quail:  Sahin et al., 2008) . Several treatments have been proposed in order to improve the nutritive value of dried tomato pomace in poultry. No significant differences were found between heat treatments (hot air at 121°C vs. sun drying) and soaking in alkali, and after these treatments a 10% inclusion rate of pomace in the diet increased performance  (Al-Betawi, 2005 ). An enzyme treatment (enzyme cocktail) failed to improve broiler performance  (Tabeidian et al., 2011) . In conclusion, for optimal performance dried tomato pomace should be avoided in very young animals. It can be recommended at up to 5-8% of the diet for growers and up to 10-12% for finishers. Inclusion rates as high as 20% can be used after 4 weeks of age if the feed is well balanced in energy, but growth and feed efficiency could be reduced. For slow-growing chickens, dried tomato pomace can be a realistic option. 
 Layers Dried tomato pomace was included successfully in diets for layers, which require a lower energy concentration than broilers  (Dotas et al., 1999) . It can be used as a substitute for wheat bran, which has a similar energy content . At inclusion rates below 10%, no effect on performance was recorded, while higher levels occasionally depress egg production  (Jafari et al., 2006) . However, in some experiments, levels of 16% to 20% pomace were tested without effecting egg production and body weight  (Yannakopoulos et al., 1992; Calislar et al., 2010) . No major effect was found on egg weight, structural characteristics  (Calislar et al., 2010; Dotas et al., 1999)  and overall quality  (Nobakht, 2007) . Because of the pigment content of dried tomato pomace (lycopene, carotenoids), egg yolk color was enhanced by its inclusion in the diet  (Calislar et al., 2010; Dotas et al., 1999) . Tomato extract could replace alfalfa extract for pigmentation of eggs  (Karadas et al., 2006) . 
 Dried tomato seeds Dried tomato seeds have a much higher energy level than dried tomato pomace (more than 12.6 MJ/kg DM) due to their high fat content. Tomato seeds tested in the diets of chicks (8-21 days of age) resulted in a similar performance as a control diet up to 15% inclusion, but at 20% growth was slightly reduced  (Persia et al., 2003) . 
 Rabbits Dried tomato pomace Dried tomato pomace is a valuable ingredient for feeding rabbits. It is one of few products that are simultaneously rich in digestible energy (13.7 MJ/kg;  Gippert et al., 1988) , mainly as a consequence of the high lipid content, rich in digestible protein (71-74% digestibility;  Battaglini et al., 1978; Gippert et al., 1988)  and also rich in fibre, particularly lignin, important in the control of digestive diseases in the rabbit  (Gidenne et al., 2010) . For rabbits, the protein of tomato by-products is rich in lysine (about 7.7 g/16 g N, with a recommendation of 4.5 g), wellbalanced in total sulphur-containing amino acids (4.1 g/16 g N, with a recommendation of 3.75 g) but is deficient in threonine  (Gippert et al., 1988) . For growing rabbits, dried tomato pomace has been introduced in the diet up to 20% without any problem  (Gippert et al., 1988; Rojas et al., 1989; Sayed et al., 2009) . Depending on local conditions, it can replace alfalfa  (Alicata et al., 1988)  or maize grain in the diet  (El-Razik, 1996) . In a carefully formulated diet, the inclusion rate of dried tomato pomace could be increased at up to 24-30% without significantly reducing performance  (Gippert et al., 1988; Waheed, 2005; Sayed et al., 2009 ). The lipids of dried tomato pomace are rich in C18:2 (56.9% of fatty acids) but poor in C18:3 (2.3%). As a consequence, the fat of rabbits fed a diet containing tomato pomace had a higher proportion of C18:2 n-6 and a lower proportion of C18:3 n-3 than the fat of rabbits fed an alfalfa-based diet  (Alicata et al., 1988) . Dried tomato pomace could also be used for feeding breeding rabbits. For example a diet containing 20% dried tomato pomace replacing dehydrated alfalfa was fed to breeding does for 8 months without any problem  (Alicata et al., 1988) .

 Other species Dried pomace is sometimes used in pet food and for fur-bearing animals. Tomato pomace has been used in dog feeds, and fox and mink diets (dry pomace at 5% of wet ration) to prevent diarrhea  (NRC, 1983  The asterisk * indicates that the average value was obtained by an equation.

 RESUMEN 
 PROPIEDADES FÍSICAS, MECÁNICAS Y DE DURABILIDAD NATURAL DE LA MADERA DE REFORESTACIÓN DE PINUS HALEPENSIS Mill. EN LA CUENCA MEDITERRÁNEA El pino carrasco Pinus halepensis Mill. se introdujo en las regiones de clima mediterráneo como árbol ornamental y actualmente es frecuente en jardines y espacios verdes. En la actualidad los bosques de pino carrasco (Pinus halepensis Mill.) cubren unas 2 500 000 ha en el contorno mediterráneo, generalmente en bajas altitudes (menos de 500 m) y en las costas. La especie se ha naturalizado tanto fuera de las ciudades del Magreb que ahora se la considera como especie invasora. Por sus dimensiones (más de 15 m de altura y 30 cm de diámetro), Pinus halepensis podría representar un interesante recurso en madera de construcción en Túnez. Este estudio se centró en evaluar la resistencia a la pudrición y las propiedades físicas y mecánicas de los pinos carrascos de repoblación en la cuenca mediterránea. Las muestras de madera de Pinus halepensis estudiadas se tomaron en Túnez para las pruebas de caracterización física y mecánica (6 procedencias) y en Marruecos para las pruebas de resistencia a la pudrición y a los isópteros. Las pruebas permitieron determinar la densidad y contracción, así como la resistencia a la pudrición. Los primeros resultados indican que la madera de Pinus halepensis de Túnez posee una gran estabilidad dimensional y una alta resistencia a la compresión. No obstante, su resistencia a la flexión es bastante baja en todas las procedencias. El módulo de resistencia a flexión es menor que en las demás resinosas de Túnez. Por último, la albura del pino carrasco es poco resistente a hongos y a termitas. Esta especie podría resultar interesante como madera de construcción o para muebles, siempre y cuando se aplique un tratamiento protector antes de su uso Introduction Aleppo Pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) is a tree species spread all around the Mediterranean basin including the islands. Its continental range extends from northern Africa (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya) and Middle East (Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestina and Turkey), up to southern Mediterranean Europe (eastern Greece, Croatia, southern Italy, southern France and eastern Spain). This coniferous wood species covers about 2.5 million hectares in the Mediterranean basin, mostly at low elevations (below 500 m) and along the coastline  (Mitsopopoulos and Dimitrikopopoulos, 2007) . In Tunisia, the Aleppo Pine forests cover 361,250 ha, representing more than 53% of Tunisian woodlands  (DGF, 2010) . About two-thirds of these forests are native stands which are occurring in semi-arid areas from northern to central Tunisia. The third remainder is made up of evenaged plantations which were implemented after the 1960's  (Garchi and Ben Mansoura, 1999) . In terms of reforestation in Morocco, artificial forests where Aleppo Pine is the most used tree  (Boulli et al., 2001)  represent about 156,670 ha  (Aafi, 2007) . In Algeria, Aleppo Pine, considered the most important and dominant local forest species, covers a surface estimated at more than 800,000 ha  (Haddad et al., 2009; Ricard and Oliva, 1995) . This typical Mediterranean wood species, easily adaptable to various eco-climatic conditions, which grants it the privilege of being the most often used tree species in the Maghreb countries' reforestation programs. The wood quantity which could be mobilized is considerable, as part of logging or thinning operations and could satisfy several industrial uses (timber wood, decking industry, paper industry…)  (Haddad et al., 2009) . Nevertheless, its industrial utilization rate remains low, compared to the availability of wood. Aleppo Pine is a xerophytic and heliophilous wood species with little and irregular annual growth. The biggest trees may reach 50 cm of diameter and 20 m height but they usually do not get over 40 cm of diameter and 15 m height. The stem it is not very straight, large branches are common, which sometimes weakens the wood quality. Around the Mediterranean basin, Aleppo Pine tree has an average growth of 2.4 m 3 /ha/year  (Gracia et al., 2004) . Natural discontinuous bands and large geographical distributions of Aleppo Pine were recorded in the Mediterranean region (  figure 1 ). Most studies on the Aleppo Pine in Tunisia estimate its productivity lower than 1.5 m 3 /ha/ year in the best stations, while in France it can reach 4 m 3 /ha/year  (Snan et al., 1992) . In Morocco and Algeria, Aleppo Pine average growth varies from 0.72 to 1.725 m 3 /ha/year and from 1.2 to 1.5 m 3 / ha/year, respectively  (Belghazi et al., 2000) . These variations could be explained by the fact that Aleppo Pine requires a minimum annual rainfall of 400 mm, and preferably 450 mm or more for reasonable growth rates. It grows better when there is seasonal ground water access, run-on water or irrigation and prefers deep well-structured soils or soils prepared by deep ripping and mounding  (Crammond, 1999) . These reforestation Aleppo Pines are now reaching their maturity and it is necessary to promote their use in an optimal way to contribute to the economy sustainability of these countries. So far, the Aleppo Pine is currently mainly being used in furniture market in Mediterranean European regions (photo 1), and by the packaging industry for producing pallets, mostly in Spain. However, traditionally round trunks were used as beams in isolated houses located nearby the forests, especially in the Mediterranean coast where it is the most abundant tree (Correal-Mòdol and Vilches Casals, 2012).  Haddad et al. (2006)  showed that Aleppo Pine wood could be also a good fibrous source for the Algerian papermaking industry and as a mean for a rational upgrading of the wood resources available by Aleppo Pine reforestation. However, few studies have been conducted to characterize the Aleppo Pine wood properties, such as chemical composition, mechanical characteristics, decay resistance, etc. It appears nonetheless that technological properties of Aleppo Pine wood vary widely according to various external factors, including the age of the trees and the growth conditions  (Malkh, 2001; Dilem, 1992; Thibaut et al., 1992) . These last studies highlighted those Aleppo Pine wood Natural distribution area of Aleppo Pine physical and mechanical properties were similar to those of the Scots Pine, Douglas fir and Spruce  (Gérard et al., 2004) . According to previous studies whose the results are presented in table I, Aleppo Pine wood species could be classified as light (Density = 0.45 -0.62), soft (Monnin hardness = 2.4 -3.5) and medium mechanical strength wood (Bending MOE = 8300 -18000 MPa, Bending MOR = 43 -140 MPa). These last properties remain highly variable depending on the geographical distribution of the tree populations mainly due to the tree growing conditions (ex: fast growing trees have lower densities), which requires the implementation of local studies towards a better understanding of the wooden material characteristics  (Langbour et al., 2008) . More physical properties of Aleppo Pine woods from different countries of Mediterranean area are illustrated in table I. Very few studies have been conducted on the determination of the natural decay resistance of Aleppo Pine wood and it is not even mentioned in EN 350 (2016). However,  Montibus (2015)  showed that Aleppo Pine heartwood tested against Poria placenta and Coniophora puteana (according to XP CEN/TS 15083-1, 2006) is slightly durable (durability class 4). However, a closer look to this classification, based on the median mass loss of the samples, shows that 30% and 50% of them are allocated to the durability class 5 (non-durable) towards Coniophora and Poria respectively. These results are consistent with data reported for other Pine wood species and listed in EN 350 (2016). Thus, the Maritime Pine has a durability class of ""moderately to slightly"" durable (classes 3-4) and Corsica Laricio Pine has a durability class of ""slightly durable"" (class 4) with a high level of variability. However, Aleppo Pine sapwood has an impregnability class-1 allowing it to be efficiently treated by the addition of wood preservative conferring to the wood material a durability up to class 1 (very durable), which allows it to be used in outdoor or wet conditions  (Montibus, 2015) . Through several studies on the Tunisian woods thermal modification  (Elaieb et al., 2014; Candelier et al., 2015; , Tunisian Aleppo Pine samples [25 x 10 x 5 mm 3 (L x R x T)] were submitted to screening decay resistance tests during 16 weeks, as virulence control samples, under different fungal attacks. Results showed that Aleppo Pine wood has a durability class-4 against Poria placenta (ML ≈ 25%) , Coriolus versicolor (ML ≈ 24%), Gloeophyllum trabeum (ML ≈ 22%) and Coniophora puteana (ML ≈ 23%)  (Elaieb et al., 2014) . The goal of the study was to characterize the physical, mechanical properties and decay resistance to identify the potential valorization of the Aleppo Pine from Maghreb. Considering that the Aleppo Pine is a significant resource in Maghreb area, this work has focused on two objectives: (i) the study about the physical and mechanical properties of Aleppo Pine wood from six provenances in Tunisia, (ii) the study on the natural decay and termite resistance of Aleppo Pine wood from Morocco. 
 Materials and methods 
 Physical and mechanical characterization 
 Trees data selection To estimate the physical and mechanical properties of Tunisian reforestation Aleppo Pine, 6 Aleppo Pine provenances in Tunisia were investigated: Jebel Abderrahmane, Sodga, M'guila, Sakiet, Selloum, Dernaia. Twelve Aleppo Pine trees were collected in the arboretum of the region of Menzel Bouzelfa (36°48'59'' N; 10°34'07'' E). Two trees for each provenance were selected. According to  Oger and Leclercq (1997) , sampling applied to the determination of physical and mechanical properties is optimal when it is performed on a tree quantity comprised from one to five, provided that selected trees are healthy, free from defects and alteration, and have an almost perfectly straight. The studied trees were selected according to these last parameters and were classified in three different classes  (table II)  according to their diameter, size and shape  (Khouja et al., 2003) . The methodology and the results used to determine the Aleppo Pine tree classes are detailed in a previous study by  Sghaier and Khouja (2009) . 
 Physical properties Wood samples used for the physical and mechanical characterizations do not differentiate the sapwood and the heartwood for selected trees. Wood samples for physical and mechanical tests were randomly chosen in the log (figure 2), in order to observe the high results variability relating to the radial variation generally observed in such characterizations. However, intra-tree variations in wood properties according to the radial position are not discussed in this study. An overview of sampling for the physical and mechanical tests performed on the different trees issued from various Aleppo Pine provenances is shown on figure 2. 
 Densities and shrinkages To perform physical and mechanical tests, a wooden disk 50 mm in thickness was cut at 1.40 m from the ground for each selected tree. To obtain a representative sampling of the exploitable Aleppo Pine wood resource as lumber wood, extreme cases such as excessively knotty trees or the presence of reaction wood or slope grain were discarded  (ISO 4471, 1982) . From each disk, 12 samples of 3 cm width from bark to bark were cut. These samples were then cut into strip 2 cm thick. Basic density (Db), Air-dry density (after conditioning at 20 ± 2°C and 65 ± 5% RH) and Oven-dry (after drying at 103 ± 2°C) density (D m12 , D m0 ) (ISO 13061-2, 2014), shrinkage (β) [tangential (βt), radial (βr), longitudinal (βl) and volumetric (βv)]  (ISO 4469, 1981)  of the wood samples were determined using 12 wood specimens per tree of 20 × 20 × 10 mm (along the grain). The Transverse Anisotropy Ratio for Shrinkage (TARS) (βt/βr) was the ratio between tangential and radial shrinkage. The densities were determined by the gravimetric method  (Haygreen and Bowyer, 1996) .   D b = --(1) ; D m0 = --(2) ; D m12 = --(3) m 0 V h m 0 V 0 m 12 V 12 Where: m 0 = oven-dried weight of the sample (g), m 12 = air-dried weight of the sample (g), D b = basic density of wood (g.cm -3 ), D m0 = oven-dried density of wood (g.cm -3 ), D m12 = the Air-dried density of wood (g.cm -3 ), V h = green volume of the specimen (cm 3 ), V 0 = oven-dried volume of the sample (cm 3 ), V 12 = air-dried volume of wood sample (cm 3 ). Volumetric shrinkage was measured by the following equation  (4) : β v = -----x 100 (4) (V h -V 0 ) V h Similar operations were used to determine tangential (βt), radial (βr) and longitudinal (βl) shrinkages, using dimensional variation of the respective orientation. 
 Mechanical strength properties To perform mechanical resistance tests, three point bending (MOR) and compression tests were carried out for each of the selected wood tree samples, and results were compared. An INSTRON 4467 Universal Mechanical Test Machine was used for the measurements. Samples were conditioned in a climate-controlled room with 65 ± 5% RH and at 20 ± 2°C for the time required to stabilize the samples weights. 
 Bending test Three point static bending tests were carried out according to the EN 408 (2003). The sample size was 300 x 20 x 20 mm 3 (L x R x T). The moving head speed and span length were 0.09 mm.s -1 and 260 mm, respectively. The load deformation data obtained were analyzed to determine the modulus of rupture (MOR). The tests were replicated on 20 samples from each selected Aleppo Pine tree. 
 Compression strength parallel to grain Compression tests were carried out according to the EN 408  (2003) . Deviating from the standard, a reduced specimen size of 30 x 20 x 20 mm 3 (L x R x T) was used. The moving head speed was 0.09 mm.s -1 to ensure wood sample rupture within 1.5 to 2 minutes. The load deformation data obtained were analyzed to determine the modulus of rupture (MOR). 20 specimens per selected tree were tested. 
 Decay resistance tests 
 Woods sample selection For the Aleppo Pine decay resistance study, trees used for testing come from an experimental Aleppo Pine reforestation area located in the region of El Had Brachwa in Morocco (33°42'23.3''N; 6°37'25.0'' W). Two Aleppo Pine trees of diameter 70 cm at 1.30 m from the ground were selected. 
 Natural durability tests Aleppo Pine heartwood samples of 5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm 3 (L x R x T) coming from both trees were tested to evaluate their resistance against fungal attack according to XP CEN/TS  15083-1 (2006) . Decay resistance was determined for three brown rot fungi: Coniophora puteana (Schumacher ex Fries) Karsten, strain BAM Ebw., Poria placenta (Fries) Cooke sensu J. Eriksson, strain FPRL 280, and Gloeophyllum trabeum (Persoon ex Fries) Murrill, strain BAM Ebw. 109. For each fungus, 32 Aleppo Pine heartwood samples and 10 Scot Pine (Pinus sylvestris) sapwood virulence controls were tested. Sterile culture medium prepared from malt (40 g) and agar (20 g) in distilled water (1 L), was placed in a culture flask inoculated with a small piece of mycelium of a freshly grown pure culture and incubated for two weeks at 22°C and 70% relative humidity (RH) to allow full colonization of the medium by the mycelium. All wood samples were sterilized twice by autoclave at 121°C for 20 min. Incubation was carried out for 16 weeks at 22°C, 70% RH in a dark climatic chamber. Once the fungal exposure was completed, the mycelium was removed and the specimens were weighed in order to evaluate their moisture content at the end of the fungal exposure. The specimens were then dried at 103°C, and their final weight was recorded. The moisture content at the end of the test (data not shown) as well as the weight loss were determined. Weight loss (WL) was expressed as a percentage of the initial oven-dry weight of the wood sample according to the formula: WL (%) = ------x 100 (5) (m 0 -m f ) m 0 Where: m f = final dry mass of wood samples after fungal exposure, m 0 = initial dry mass of wood sample. According to the calculated media, mass loss, wood samples were classified in Durabiliy class. Durability classes from the XP CEN/TS 15083-1 (2006) standard are exposed on table III.  
 Termite resistance tests Termite resistance was evaluated using Reticulitermes flavipes (ex santonensis) termites using a non-choice test based on the guidelines of the European standard EN118 (2005) -in accordance with EN 350-1 (1994) with a wood sample size adaptation. Five Aleppo Pine heartwood samples, from both trees, of size 10 x 4 x 1 cm 3 (L x R x T) were exposed to the attack of 250 termite workers, two nymphs and two soldiers, for eight weeks at 27°C, 75% RH. Four Scot Pine (Pinus sylvestris) sapwood samples were tested in the same manner as controls. At the end of the biological exposure, the survival rate of the termites was evaluated, and visual rating of sample degradations was performed according to the EN118 (2005). 
 Statistical analysis Statistical analyses (one-way analysis of variance) using Fisher test and the JMP 10.0.2 program (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) have been performed. The effects of Aleppo Pine tree provenances on the wood densities, shrinkages and mechanical properties were evaluated using ANOVA and Duncan's comparison test. Such analysis allows to class results into several categories from ""A"" to ""E"". Systems which are not connected by the same letter are largely different at the 5% level. In addition, physical and mechanical results were compared together and to Aleppo Pine growth conditions as stand density in the provenance section. An ANOVA analysis was used to examine the difference in average value of each property between any two of stands. Meanwhile, the average values of each stand density variable and wood properties were calculated to establish a correlation table using a built-in Microsoft Excel TM statistical tool. 
 Results 
 Statistical analysis To show the impact of Aleppo Pine tree provenances on physical and mechanical properties, the ANOVA and Duncan's tests have been performed using the results cited above. These statistical analysis results are illustrated by letters from A to E, in figures 3, 4 and 5. Systems which are not connected by the same letter are largely different at the 5% level. In addition, all results of Tunisians Aleppo Pine tree characteristics and their respective wood physical properties are synthetized in table IV. The results from statistical analysis issued from these average values are presented in table V and table VI.  Table V  shows the coefficients of correlation between forestry conditions (stand density), physical properties (Wood basic density -Db, volumetric shrinkage -βv) and mechanical strengths (Bending and compression strength -MOR) which were measured in this study. Finally, a focus has been done on the relationships between the Aleppo Pine stand density, the tree characteristics and the physical and mechanical wood properties. The results on such effects of stand density on wood properties are illustrated in  Table VI . 
 Physical and mechanical characterization Densities Air-dried Density (D m12 ) is commonly used to compare different woods. Basic Density (Db), Oven-Dried Density (D m0 ) and Air-dried Density (D m12 ) have been measured on each wood sample. Average values of these different densities are presented in table III. The results did not provide  any significant effect of the tree growth area and stand density on these wood densities (  figure 3 ). Even if, the higher wood basic density (D b = 0.53) is those of Aleppo Pine wood from Sakiet area with the higher tree population density, the lower basic densities corresponds to the Aleppo Pine wood density from Jbel Abderrahmane (D b = 0.48) and Dernaia (D b = 0.47) areas with the lower stand density. The correlation coefficient  (table VI)  is not efficient enough to link basic density with stand density. The results obtained through this study are in agreement with those from  Dhaman (1974 Dhaman ( , 1986  who found that Tunisian Aleppo Pine wood has an infra-density ranged from 500 to 570 kg/m 3 . 
 Shrinkages According to the shrinkage analyses, the results illustrated in figure 4, show the tangential (βt), radial (βr) and volumetric (βv) shrinkage values of Aleppo Pine woods are very similar to each other, irrespective of the tree's origin and tree population density. Higher shrinkage values are 1.1% (βl), 6.5% (βv) and 15% (βv) for Aleppo Pine from Selloum, 7.8% (βt) for Pinus halepensis from Sakiet. These various average shrinkage values are 0.71% (βl), 6.55% (βt), 5.73% (βr) and 13.06% (βv), respectively.     
 Mechanical properties The mechanical test results of each wood sample issued from the six regions are shown in table V. Modulus of rupture (MOR) reflects the maximum capacity in bending or in compression and is proportional to the maximum moment borne by a sample. Based on the MOR in bending and in compression strength measurements (figure 5) and the results from statistical analyses using the t-test with Microsoft Excel TM statistical tool  (table V) , tree growing area and stand density does not have a significant impact on Aleppo Pinewood mechanical properties. The MOR average values in bending and in compression of northern Tunisian woods tested in this study were 56.63 MPa and 73.92 MPa, respectively. These results show that the Northern Tunisian Aleppo Pine wood can be classified as having low static bending strength (50 MPa < MOR < 75 MPa) and high axial compressive strength (55 MPa < MOR < 75 MPa)  (Collardet and Besset, 1998) . According to previous studies  (Malkh, 2001; Dilem, 1992; Thibaut et al., 1992; Langbour et al., 2008) mechanical  properties of Aleppo Pine wood vary widely according to various external factors, including the age of the trees and the growth conditions. In the present study, MOR in bending and in compression strength measurements are respectively ranged from 66.3 to 83.8 MPa and from 49.4 to 78.2 MPa. Northern Tunisian Aleppo Pine supports the comparison with other traditional softwood species as Pinus sylvestris, Abies alba, Pseudotsuga menziesii and Picea abies, both for its mechanical properties and its dimensional stability characteristics  (Gérard et al., 2004) . Aleppo Pine wood (from Morocco) was studied for its durability towards both fungi and termites. The tests were performed without accelerated ageing according to the methods described in the EN 350-1 (1994). 
 Decay resistance The mean mass loss on all the Pinus sylvestris reference specimens was 48.23% for Gloeophyllum trabeum, 38.74% for Coniophora puteana, and 29.80% for Poria placenta. The results about natural durability against fungi of Aleppo Pine wood will be detailed according to each testing fungal species. It must be noticed that only few other durability results about Aleppo Pine wood are available in literature. The results of the biological resistance against Basidiomycetes are given in table VII. The mass losses of the controls allow the test validation. Aleppo Pine was shown to be slightly durable towards Poria placenta, and non-durable towards both Gloeophyllum trabeum and Coniophora puteana. Considering the   (Montibus, 2015) , and results from  Elaieb et al. (2014  concerning decay resistance of the Tunisian Aleppo Pine wood. So, it results that Aleppo Pine wood species is globally classified as a slightly or non-durable wood (corresponding to a durability class 4 or 5). According to the EN 460 standard (1994), Aleppo Pine wood can be used in use class 1 and in use class 2 provided that the material undergoes a preservation treatment depending on the material utilization conditions. 
 Termite resistance The termite resistance test is valid as the Pinus sylvestris sapwood controls presented a strong attack (visual rating 4) and above 50% of the termite workers remainded alive at the end of the test. After 8 weeks of Aleppo Pine samples exposure to termites, the median survival rate of the insects was 42.4% and the termite attack had got through all samples causing tunneling and heavy degradations. All Aleppo Pine samples had a visual rating of 4, which corresponds to a strong degradation. In other words, Moroccan Aleppo Pine used in this study was classified sensible to termites. 
 Discussion Effects of the Aleppo Pine tree provenance on physical and mechanical wood properties  Zobel and Van Buijtenen (1989)  suggest that large structure variations are produced by changes in climate, site and management characteristics, due to the influence of these extrinsic factors on various activities. The results from table V indicate that there are no significant differences among wood coming from different provenances (with various locations, soil characteristics and pluviometry levels) in terms of wood densities. Concerning the Aleppo Pine wood shrinkages properties, it results that the wood coming from Sakiet (H) and Selloum (AG) areas have significant higher radial (β r ), tangential (β t ) and volumetric (β v ) shrinkages values than the woods coming from the four other provenances. This difference could be explained by the high level of pluviometry and the soil composition of the Sakiet (H) and Selloum (AG) areas. Results show that Aleppo Pine wood from Sakiet (H) has a significant higher Bending strength than the other woods, which could be explained by the high values of tree size and wood basic density. In fact, our results from the second statistical analysis, illustrated in table V, show that tree size and wood basic density are moderately correlated with the wood bending strength properties. The variability of the compression MOR according to the tree provenance is less significant than those of Bending MOR. Similar results were found recently by a study focused on the Tunisian Pinus pinea wood characterization . 
 Correlations between forestry conditions, tree characteristics and physical/mechanical Aleppo Pine wood properties Results from table V show that the most positive correlations were found between wood stand density and bending strength (MOR Bend) [correlation coefficient of 0.49, P value = 0.105], and between basic density (Db) and bending strength (MOR Bend) [correlation coefficient of 0.52, P value = 0.082]. These results support previous studies  (Zhang and Zhong, 1997; Betkas et al., 2002; Heräjärvi, 2004) . According to table VI, Aleppo Pine stand density is moderately correlated with the tree size (correlation coefficient of 0.499, P value = 0.098). Although it was weak, tree diameter had a positive correlation with wood bending and compression MOR. Wood basic density seems also to have slight positive correlation with stand density and moderate positive correlation with bending MOR. Concerning wood shrinkages properties, it appears that stand density have moderate positive correlations with tangential and volumetric shrinkages and slight positive correlation with the Transverse Anisotropic Ratio for Shrinkage (β t /β r ). No other obvious correlations between stand densities, tree diameters, tree heights and physical and mechanical properties have been found through this study. 
 Aleppo Pine wood classification According to  Campredon (1967) , Tunisian Aleppo Pine timbers tested in this study can be classified as a light heavy weight wood (0.5 < D m12 < 0.6), medium wood volumetric (10% < β v < 15%) and medium wood linear (6.5% < β t < 10%; 3.75% < β r < 6.5%) shrinkages. In addition, Aleppo Pine wood generally seems to have a lower Transverse Anisotropy Ratio for Shrinkage (β t /β r = 1.15) than those of other softwood species  (El Jazouli et al., 2000; Azzouzi, 1995;  such as Pinus pinea (1.53), Pinus pinaster (2), Pinus sylvestris (1.7) or Pseudotsuga menziesii (1.7), making it a wood relatively easy to dry before being used  (Thibaut, 1992) . Relative to standard on wood durability, Moroccan Aleppo Pine heartwood appears to be classified as sensible against termites, non-durable against Coniophora puteana and Gloeophyllum trabeum basidiomycete attacks and slightly durable against Poria placenta basidiomycete attack. 
 Conclusion As for most Pine species, Moroccan Aleppo Pine showed a low durability: ""not durable"" towards both Coniophora puteana and Gloeophyllum trabeum, ""slightly durable"" toward Poria placenta attacks, and was classified ""sensible"" against termites. However, Aleppo Pine durability does not appear to vary depending on the provenance. The physical and mechanical features have shown a wood characterized by rather good values, highlighting that the wood is very stable and that the structural efficiency of the Tunisian Aleppo Pine wood is high, compared to that of the most utilized softwood species for structural purposes. From first trials the Aleppo Pine wood from Maghreb area seems to be suitable for packing and structures, even if its heartwood low durability and dimensional stability could allow, in case of high quality wood undergoing a preservation process, the use for window frames. The species shows a good ecological adaptability and the quality of the standing trees in artificial plantation seems to be better compared to other softwoods at present used in Mediterranean countries, such as Pinus pinea, Pinus radiata and Pinus insignis, even if no cultural operations, like thinning or pruning were made. Further studies on the heartwood percentage in mature trees, on the impregnability of the sapwood and on durability for above ground in use situation improve the knowledge of that wood and suggest larger utilizations of Aleppo Pine. In conclusion, all qualification testing showed that the Maghreb Aleppo Pine wood is softwood with good technological value. However, the high rate of resin that it contains and its large numbers of knots are two unfavorable factors for an efficient sawing and they do that the Aleppo Pine wood remains very limited used as wood material. It could be interesting now to think about new forestry methods to limit the number of nodes and improve the tree rectitude.

The R. solanacearum species complex (RSSC) is composed of four phylotypes (I, II, III, and IV). Among these, the pandemic phylotype I displays population structure (demographic expansion) and genomic features (recombination traces) probably at the origin of its high evolutionary potential  (4) , allowing it to adapt to new host species or resistant accessions of a host species. Among Solanaceae, eggplant is the crop species that carries the highest levels of resistance to R. solanacearum. So far, AG91-25 is the first eggplant genotype whose bacterial wilt resistance has been genetically mapped and associated with one major resistance gene (ers1)  (5) . Some R. solanacearum strains are totally controlled by AG91-25, while other strains are able to overcome its resistance  (6, 7) . To investigate the molecular bases driving these virulence differences, we sequenced nine strains of R. solanacearum that displayed different virulence patterns on AG91-25 (virulent, avirulent, and provoking latent infection) (J. Guinard, unpublished data; and 6-8), paying particular attention to differences in the type III effector gene (T3E) content between strains. Of these nine strains, eight are of phylotype I and originate from Asia (RUN0969 and RUN0157), Africa (RUN0215 and RUN1744), the Indian Ocean (RUN3012, RUN3013, and RUN3014), and South America (RUN1985), whereas RUN0039 belongs to phylotype III and originates from West Africa. Genomic DNA was extracted using the Wizard genomic DNA purification kit (Promega). The strains were sequenced to a depth of~100ϫ using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 technology (150-base paired-end reads with an average insert size of 450 bp). The reads were quality trimmed using HTQC (9) before being assembled using CLC Genomics Workbench version 7.0.3 (CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark). Genome assemblies were annotated automatically using the Web interface of the MicroScope platform  (10) . The nine genomes consist of 266 to 728 contigs. The genome sizes of the phylotype I strains range from 5.57 to 5.84 Mb, while the phylotype III genome is shorter, at 5.42 Mb. The overall GϩC contents range from 66.86 to 67.05%. The draft genomes contain between 5,198 and 5,426 coding sequences, with 48 to 52 tRNA genes and 2 to 3 complete rRNA loci. The genomes were submitted to the Ralstonia T3E website (https: //iant.toulouse.inra.fr/bacteria/annotation/site/prj/T3Ev2/) (11) for T3E identification and rip-based annotation. The phylotype I strains contain 67 to 73 effector genes and two to seven pseudogenes, which are in the range of those in the reference phylotype I genome GMI1000  (11) . Conversely, the phylotype III RUN39 contains only 55 T3Es and seven pseudogenes, which constitutes a T3E repertoire smaller than that of the phylotype I and phylotype III reference strain CMR15 (12). We did not find a clear association between T3E repertoire and virulence on AG91-25. However, the prevalence of the genes ripAX2, ripA1, ripC2, ripE2, ripS6, and ripP2 was different between avirulent and virulent strains. Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. The nine genome sequences have been deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under the study accession number PRJEB11298. The genome accession numbers are summarized in  Table 1 .

Family farms dominate agriculture and mainly practise subsistence agriculture and dryland farming. Improving the productivity of small-scale farmers would increase agricultural output. However, to achieve this, some transformation of the sector is needed such as the adoption of strategies to create a more integrated agricultural sector focusing on job creation, food self-sufficiency and feedstock production for both domestic use and export  (Sitóe, 2005) . In Mozambique, crop production is characterized by low productivity and limited intensification  (Sitóe, 2010; Mosca, 2014) . With the population increasing by 600,000 per year  (UN, 2011; INE, 2010b)  it is imperative to improve the productivity of the agricultural sector. One key to improving productivity is irrigation, which is currently underdeveloped. Its potential is about 3 million hectares, but only 90,000 hectares are currently irrigated. Most of the systems use furrow or surface irrigation and were developed during the colonial period (mainly in the 1950s) in the southern region. Development ceased during the war of independence  but resumed after 2001 with public funds and donations from development partners, which mainly resulted in the formation of small-scale irrigator associations and cooperatives with plot sizes ranging from 0.5 to 10 hectares. Still, large-scale commercial irrigation schemes and individual farms were also developed. In central and northern Mozambique the focus has been on new development, while in southern Mozambique it has been on rehabilitation of the existing schemes and other aspects such as value chain improvement. Although farmers produce a variety of crops, about 80% grow maize, and 76% cassava. Both crops are mainly for subsistence  (INE, 2010a; MINAG, 2010) . Small-scale farmers, therefore, have little produce with which to raise revenue for farm inputs and other household expenses, such as health and education. As a result, households depend on diverse income sources including agriculture, forestry, livestock and off-farm work  (Cunguara & Garrett, 2011) . Irrigation enables farmers to farm year-round and diversify their crops. This can increase food security and profitability by enabling farmers to grow a greater range and variety of commodities and benefit from seasonal price variations in the market. Diversification, both in agricultural production and income sources, reduces the risks associated with crop failure: diseases, pests, extreme climate events, fluctuating market demand and commodity prices  (Cunguara & Garrett, 2011) . To improve the productivity and profitability of small-scale irrigated farms it is necessary to understand their reality, including the factors impeding their profitability and the context in which they operate with respect to socio-economic characteristics and government policies  (Sitóe, 2005) . This article aims to contribute to this understanding using the 25 de Setembro irrigation scheme (hereafter, the scheme) as a case study. It explores the potential to improve profitability through crop diversification, improved market access and extension services and how different farmer types adopt different strategies. 
 Irrigated agriculture in southern Mozambique Maputo Province is in southern Mozambique; it includes the capital city and the population of the whole province is about 1.2 million inhabitants. The climate is semi-arid; the wet season occurs from October to March, with average yearly precipitation of 761 mm and evaporation of 1245 mm  (FEWS NET, 2016) . During the wet season, January-February is when precipitation is higher than evaporation. The beginning and the end of the wet season vary significantly from year to year, and the ability to predict this variability is still poor. This variability means that rain-fed agriculture is associated with high risk. One way of managing and reducing this risk is to cultivate riparian land, which has better soil moisture and longer water retention. This practice extends the cropping season to July or August and enables the production of two crops. Another way of managing drought is the construction of irrigation systems. Of the 90,000 hectares of irrigated land in the country, 20,086 hectares is in southern Mozambique, and of this, close to 19% is located in Maputo Province. Most schemes in southern Mozambique are small-scale, constructed by the government and managed by irrigators through associations or cooperatives. Associations aim to promote social, educational, cultural and political objectives to benefit certain groups; they are philanthropic in nature. Cooperatives are primarily facilitators of business operations  (SEBRAE, 2015) . In small-scale schemes, irrigators are responsible for maintenance of the infrastructure. Two types of large-scale schemes also exist, constructed by the government or private companies. Private companies also manage the schemes constructed by the government and are responsible for maintenance of the infrastructure as well as water distribution. Farmers are responsible only for maintaining the canals that convey water to their plots and paying for water service. The government provides extension officers to help irrigators improve their performance, and most are allocated to small-scale schemes. In emergency situations, the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security provides inputs to farmers, both irrigators and rain-fed. Traditionally, farms in Maputo Province produce maize, cowpea and groundnuts  (Sitóe, 2005) , mainly for subsistence. Farmers in Maputo Province wanting access to markets with better prices, mainly in Maputo City, face high transportation costs. The proximity of southern Mozambique to South Africa means that farmers may face labour constraints due to worker migration as well as unfair competition from imports, particularly of fresh produce, from neighbouring countries. 
 Study area, methodology and data collection A number of schemes, both large and small, were considered in this study. In collaboration with the National Institute of Irrigation (www.inir.gov.mz), the 25 de Setembro scheme was selected based on its potential to improve or address agronomic practices, institutional capacity, market barriers and farming practices and factors such as site accessibility, research cost, crop diversity and the willingness to collaborate of the district authority. The scheme is in Boane District, 30 km south of Maputo City. Constructed in 1975, it consists of 1433 m of concrete canals and 2797 m of earthen canals supplying 38 hectares. After independence, in 1981, the scheme was transferred to the Cooperativa 25 de Setembro, which then had 56 members. The irrigators, all members of the cooperative, came from various parts of Mozambique. The number of irrigators has since declined to 38, with 22 being females and 16 males  (Table 1) . Water is extracted from the Umbelúzi River using a diesel pump, distributed by gravity through a canal system, and applied to the fields using furrow system. Currently, irrigators pay for pump fuel individually. A schedule is maintained in the cooperative's office, and members can book an available time. However, this is subject to constant negotiation as, at the time of writing, irrigators could receive water only every 15 days, on average. Irrigators can use the tractor and implements for fieldwork but have to pay a fee, mainly to cover the fuel cost. The cooperative also rents the tractor to neighbouring farmers at commercial rates. Irrigators can make their own decisions about what to plant and when, but have to report this to the cooperative's chief of production. The cooperative has faced several difficulties, such as breakdown of the tractor and the pump, management issues, members leaving the scheme, non-payment of fees and the theft of chickens, which resulted in cessation of chicken production and distrust among members. Floods in 1984 destroyed much of the infrastructure, which was eventually repaired with support from Helvetas (a Swiss NGO) and the government. In 2015, the Japanese International Cooperation Agency donated a new tractor and two-ton truck. Both men and women participate in the majority of farm work. However, the men are responsible for building, fetching water and supplementing household income by off-farm work, while the women are responsible for most domestic work. This article reports on a range of data collected over a two-year period. First, a baseline survey was undertaken in July 2014 to elicit household information: demographics, farm characteristics, use of financial services, asset ownership and market conditions. The questionnaire was piloted, revised and then implemented by trained enumerators through face-to face interviews with 25 of the 38 households. Two short surveys of a panel of 20 randomly selected irrigators were undertaken, and two focus groups were held in January and July 2015 aiming to evaluate the progress of the project activities and the farmers' engagement, when possible with different farmers; however, the small number of households meant this was not always possible. Data collection also included observations by two project officers regularly visiting the scheme; reports from the meetings of the Agricultural Innovation Platform; and discussions with irrigators and scheme leaders. The survey data were used to produce frequency tables and an index of asset ownership and to support the development of typologies. The qualitative data were used to support the discussion of the quantitative findings as well as the development of the typologies. 
 Results The results are reported in five parts: (1) crop and income diversification; (2) factors influencing crop choice; (3) barriers to improving productivity and profitability; (4) farmer typologies; and (5) crop diversification strategies. 
 Crop and income diversification Household income in the scheme relies on a diverse income stream: 32% of irrigators work off-farm, and 68% grow more than one crop  (Figure 1 ). In total, 18 different crops are grown   Figure 2 ). According to focus group discussions and the short surveys, the main advantage of diversification is to reduce the risks associated with market fluctuations, pests and diseases, post-harvest losses and climatic uncertainties. This confirms the findings of  Cunguara and Garrett (2011) .  The most frequently grown crops are maize, cabbage and green beans  (Figure 2 ), all of which are traditionally grown on rain-fed land  (Bartecchi, 2011 ) . Many families have to sell their crops immediately after harvest when prices are low because of their need for cash. Some of the vegetables, such as tomatoes, can only be stored for a limited period. Other vegetables, such as chillies, have a more limited use in traditional food systems and are grown for the Maputo market. Two types of diversification are evident among the irrigators: production of traditional crops -maize, cabbage and green beans -and production of non-traditional crops -tomatoes, chillies, cucumbers, onions, lettuce, potatoes and beetroot.   
 Factors influencing crop choice 
 Market segments and price fluctuations To explore how crop price and price fluctuations influence cropping decisions and to identify potential cropping strategies, seasonal variations in crop price were analyzed for the wholesale market and the retail markets in Maputo City and Boane from September 2012 to May 2015. The analysis used weekly data from Sistema de Informação de Mercados Agrícolas  (SIMA, 2015) . Of the crops grown at the scheme, wholesale prices were available for three crops and retail prices for eight crops  (Table 2 ).  Not surprisingly, vegetable prices fluctuate more than maize and other staple foods, such as cowpea in Maputo and beans in Boane. The retail price of vegetables tends to be more variable in Boane than in Maputo, with the exception of potatoes and beans. Potatoes are more often available at Boane than at Maputo, probably because potatoes are grown locally. Carrot and cabbage prices in Maputo were quite stable from 2012 to 2014  (Figure 3b  and 3c). This may indicate that imports influence the price of these crops more than local production. SIMA provides only consumer prices. The price paid to farmers will generally be lower, even though the higher prices for basic food in Boane suggest that there is a potential local demand. The analysis of the difference between retail prices in Boane and Maputo  (Table 2 ) and the variability of price  (Figure 3 (a)-3(c)) identified three types of production scenarios: (1) Traditional crops such as maize, cowpea, beans, cassava and groundnuts are the staple local foods. For these products, the Boane retail price predominantly remains above the Maputo retail price, except for a short period during the harvest of the rain-fed crops when prices in Boane plunge in response to high supply. However, this pattern is less clear with sweet potatoes, with occasional high weekly variation due to irregular local supply. (2) Other products with local demand, mainly vegetables such as cabbage or tomatoes, have an unpredictable variation of price in the retail market at Boane and fluctuate with local supply. (3) Products more connected to the Maputo market, such as potatoes, have unstable prices, which may indicate that local producers are failing to provide regular supply. The retail prices of these products are highly variable from week to week, even during the wet season, when production is much lower. During the main production season of traditional foods, the prices can fall below transportation costs, which occurs when other neighbouring areas supply the wholesale market.   (2015)  and survey data). The prices of local but less commonly produced crops are more stable due to the regularity of the imported supply. Hence, these products could provide an opportunity for local growers, as they are associated with less market risk. 
 Seasonal variability of yield The risk of diseases and pest attacks increases in the wet season. Hence, the dry season presents an opportunity to minimize input costs and yield losses. This is particularly the case for tomatoes, which are only produced during the dry season (  Figure 4) . Comparing the yield of major crops produced during the wet and dry seasons  (Figure 4 ), the highest yields for maize (5432 kg/ha) and chilli (2400 kg/ha) are achieved during the dry season, when irrigation and soil moisture can be better managed to meet water requirements. The highest yields of cabbage (12,133 kg/ha), green beans (6000 kg/ha) and sweet potato (5000 kg/ha) are obtained in the wet season, when these crops receive the highest prices due to lower supply. Hence, irrigators growing these crops on dry land during the wet season are increasing their productivity and should be more profitable. However, farmers said that to be successful they needed better technical skills and/or access to farm inputs, funding and labour. 
 Market access Irrigators seem to have poor access to market information. They have two main decisions to make: when to plant, which influences timing of selling; and where to sell. Irrigators usually sell their produce immediately after harvest: during February and March in the wet season and July to September in the dry season. Buyers often harvest the crops. Although the prices paid for commodities at the farm gate are lower, compared to those paid in Maputo City  (Figure 5a and 5b) , when the crops are collected by buyers the farmers do not have to pay harvest and transportation costs. At harvest times, prices are generally lower, as supply in the market is high  (Figure 3a-3c) ;  Figure 5 ), although there may be high weekly variations. For example, the price of tomatoes can reach 40 MT/kg in Maputo in the wet season and 28 MT/kg in the dry season. The difference is particularly high for some crops, such as cabbage, with a price of 15 MT/kg for large cabbages (4-5 kg) at plot level compared to 15-20 MT/kg at the market in Boane and 50 MT/kg in Maputo. However, for other crops, such as green maize, the difference is not significant. Irrigators do not grow tomatoes in the wet season and do not benefit from the higher prices during that season. The price difference between the farm gate and Maputo is particularly high for cabbage in both dry and wet seasons. On the other hand, there is a very little difference in maize prices, which confirms the value of dry-season maize. According to the baseline survey, only 27% of irrigators were aware of buyers who will pay a higher price than they were currently receiving. However, irrigators perceive that they are unable to sell to these buyers due to high transportation costs. 
 Technical skills and extension services There has been no assessment of the technical skills of irrigators in the scheme. Observations and conversations at the plot level suggest that irrigators base their irrigation decisions on the appearance of plants and the soil surface. As a result, some farmers are likely to over-irrigate, leading to nutrient leaching and reduced productivity, while others are likely to under-irrigate due to the high cost of fuel, resulting in yield losses. Extension services are critical to provide crop management advice -such as the type, amount and relative importance of farm inputs, crop choices, irrigation scheduling and market options -and to improve agricultural and livestock practices. It is the responsibility of the government to ensure that extension officers are available free of charge and assist farmers where and when needed. However, due to the size of some regions, it is difficult to provide these services consistently across regions. The local authority has 12 extension officers to cover all the farmers in the district for rain-fed, irrigated and livestock advice.  Extension officers have little influence in the scheme. According to the short survey, only 28% of farmers have accessed an extension officer during the last two years. According to the baseline survey, 40% make their farming decisions based on their own experiences, conversations with other farmers and market observations. This suggests that extension officers are not present as frequently as they should be, and that consequently they are adding little to irrigators' knowledge and skills. Field observations suggest that the presence of extension officers is infrequent. One of the main reasons for this is poor salary and working conditions. The average salary for extension officers is USD 111 per month, while similarly skilled officers in the private and NGO sectors are paid approximately USD 1000 per month  (MINAG, 2010) . Consequently, the more experienced extension officers look for better conditions, contributing to high staff turnover  (Eicher, 2002) , which affects the efficiency and motivation of extension officers. Budgetary constraints further affect their ability to provide irrigators with appropriate services as officers lack access to transportation and ongoing training. These findings are consistent with the work done by Eicher  (2002) , which covered three provinces and identified a link between low agricultural productivity and lack of adequate technical support from extension services as well as the extension techniques used. The link between extension services and agricultural research is weak, and officers' advice is not informed by the most recent research. Farmers' field schools are the method most commonly used for the transfer of technology. These schools use the 'training and visit' approach, which is 'top-down' and not oriented to the needs of farmers  (DANIDA, 2002) . Despite the lack of extension services, the cooperative has received extensive support from the government and NGOs to improve agricultural practices. Examples are  (1)    
 Barriers to improving productivity and profitability With respect to the use of financial services, 36% of irrigators had no access to formal financial services, 52% had a bank account and 8% had a bank loan. One irrigator, in addition to a bank account and credit from the bank, also used telephone banking. Access to loans is a crucial issue in this scheme as the ability to purchase inputs (seeds and fertilizer) and implements are two of the main constraints, reported by 84% and 64% of irrigators, respectively  (Table 3) . Reflecting this, while all farmers claim to use some pesticides, not all use fertilizer. According to  Leonardo et al. (2015) , labour is the most limiting factor for improved productivity in Mozambique; others disagree and find that productivity is constrained by  Table 3 . main constraints on improving the viability of land. 
 Constraint Irrigators experiencing constraint Inputs (seeds and fertilizer) 84% Implements and tools 64% access to functional markets 36% location and is context specific  (Beekman, Veldwisch, & Bolding, 2014) . This study concurs with the latter and finds that labour is a constraint only in some households, which affects crop choice or requires cash payments to hire non-family labour. In rain-fed systems, labour demand reflects the intensive manual work associated with land preparation. In the scheme, farmers use tractors for land preparation, and the critical labour issues are seeding, managing water, and notably weeding. Labour availability depends on family size, the age of the household head and the number of young people available. Discussions with irrigators suggest that young people prefer irregular but better-paid off-farm jobs, which takes them away from home and leaves the grandparents with the responsibility for their grandchildren and the farm. Domestic tasks reduce women's availability for farm work, especially those with younger children. Small farm households headed by widows are particularly likely to suffer from lack of labour and are often among the poorest  (Cumbe, Lucas, & Matsinhe, 2009 ). 
 Farmer typologies Following  Landais (1998) , this research adopts a functional farm typology to explore how resource access influences cropping strategies. Functional typology extends the categorization of farms beyond production factors and considers the dynamics of production, livelihood strategies and the history of the farm household. This study's typology is based on qualitative information gathered through project officers' weekly visits, focus groups and Agricultural Innovation Platform meetings; irrigators' access to key resources; and a consideration of the following variables from the baseline survey: Irrigated hectare per unit of family labour, computed by dividing the irrigated area by the household's full-time adult equivalent workforce (FTE). The composition of the household -with respect to gender, age and percentage of time spent on the farm -formed the basis for estimating the FTE. Capacity to hire non-family labour and purchase farm inputs, estimated using two proxies: (a) the value of a household's assets based on their second-hand value (assets were reported in the baseline survey), rated on a scale from 1 to 5; and (b) use of formal financial products, rated on a scale from 0 to 3 products. Size of the irrigated area. Residence status: non-resident if at least the household head is living and working off-farm. This reflects a household's access to off-farm income, which influences the ability to hire labour and buy inputs as well as the household's commitment to the farm. Age of the household head. This reflects the level of irrigation experience. Housing condition was not considered since farmers are provided housing through the scheme. Seven types of farmers were identified  (Table 4) , and elements of farm development and family history help explain how they evolved (  Figure 6 ). Considering that plots were allocated in 1981, the first-generation farmers now cohabit with the younger generations taking over the farm. Further, some of those who took over the farm 30 years ago have moved away and now farm the plot more or less remotely. Given the small number of farmers per type, the quantitative indicators should be interpreted with caution. Originally, there appear to have been two types of farmers: resident farmers, only engaging in farming, and non-resident farmers, engaging in off-farm work and residing outside the scheme. The resident farmers seem to have evolved into five different types: widowed (1), first-generation (3a), second-generation (3b), new-generation (3c) and innovative market gardener (4). There are two types of non-resident farmers: weekend farmers (2a) and non-resident household head (2b). Widowed farmers have: (a) the lowest asset value and use of financial products; (b) similar access to family labour as the first-and second-generation farmers (0.57 ha/FTE); and (c) the smallest irrigated area, apart from the innovative market gardener. Their livelihoods depend on subsistence agriculture and include rain-fed crops. Both types of non-resident farmers have an urban lifestyle. The weekend farmers spend most of their time in the city for their off-farm work. The heads of households are relatively young, with the highest value of assets and the second-highest use of financial products. They have a relatively small irrigated farm (1.0 ha) and a limited family workforce (2.28 ha/ FTE). In the non-resident household head type, the household head lives in the city, but the family works on the farm. They have the second-largest irrigated area, the second-highest area per unit of family labour (0.94 ha/FTE), the second-highest age, and high asset values. However, they use few financial resources. The first-generation farmers have the highest average age and control the largest irrigated command area. They have a family workforce (0.57 ha/FTE) that is similar to the widowed and second-generation farmers, limited use of financial resources and moderate value of assets. The second-generation farmers are somewhat younger, their irrigated area is relatively small, and they have similar availability of family labour (0.56 ha/FTE). The value of their assets is high, and their use of financial resources is good. The new-generation farmers are the youngest. They have a relatively small irrigated area (similar to second-generation) but lower availability of family labour (0.83 ha/FTE), which probably reflects the household's having school-age children. These farmers have limited use of financial resources, and the value of their assets is low. Compared to the two other resident groups, the new-generation farmers have recently taken over the farm and have not yet accumulated assets. The last type, the innovative market gardener, is unique. This farmer is a middle-aged woman with a very small farm (0.07 ha), very good access to financial products and highvalue assets. The intensive nature of production is supported by the lowest ratio of irrigated area to family workforce (0.03 ha/FTE). 
 Crop diversification strategies The different farmer types follow different diversification strategies  (Tables 5 and 6 ). The two non-resident types have opposing strategies. The weekend farmers grow only maize and are the only group with no diversification. Maize is an easy-to-manage but water-intensive crop that is suited to distant management with minimum family labour. The non-resident household head type has the highest level of diversification: an average of 5.33 crops in addition to maize, and an average of 2.67 non-traditional crops. This diversification probably reflects their access to off-farm income as well as family labour. Among the resident farmers, the older first-generation farmers mainly diversify by growing a mix of traditional crops, which are easier to manage, have less market risk and are grown on dry land. The younger, second-generation farmers diversify by growing traditional and non-traditional crops, with some success, as they have accumulated more wealth over time than first-generation farmers. They have been able to produce and market their crops profitably despite the high price volatility. The diversification strategy of the widowed farmers appears to be a simplified version of the first-and second-generation farmers. Four out of seven of these farmers combine maize production with one or two traditional or non-traditional crops. The innovative market gardener has a completely different diversification strategy: attempting to maximize profit from a small area by only producing non-traditional crops. This cropping pattern is similar to that used by peri-urban horticultural producers in Maputo's greenbelt. The preference for traditional crops can stem from experience with the cropping techniques; a desire to produce a crop that contributes to both home consumption and cash income; or the need to have access to a more secure market, even if profits are limited. Nontraditional crops have a higher risk in terms of productivity and the market, but can be more profitable.  Cairns, Tschirley, and Cachomba (2013)  identified four groups of horticultural producers in a sample of 616 farmers from the periphery of Maputo and the districts of Boane and Moamba. Amongst the producers, 38% had access to irrigation, and their farms ranged from small, less intensified farms (median size 0.17 hectares) to larger and more intensified horticultural farms using irrigation on 1-hectare plots. Their typology complements this analysis, which has differentiated farmers into seven types in terms of size, resource access, overall livelihood strategy and elements of pathway development. 
 Discussion Within the scheme, agricultural diversification strategies vary. Options include the use of different combinations of traditional crops (maize, cowpea, beans and groundnuts) and non-traditional crops (such as tomatoes, cabbages, chillies and onions). Maize, produced as monoculture or as part of diversification, is the main crop and can be produced year-round under irrigation. The seven farmer types follow different diversification strategies. The widowed farmer is most affected by limited access to land, labour and purchasing power. The markets for maize and beans are steady throughout the year, with very little variability in demand or price. Therefore, many irrigators sow small areas with these crops, which they harvest up to three times a year to provide an important source of income. The results of this study show that the widowed farmers and the new-generation farmers use maize and beans as cash crops. Traditional crops, such as beans and peanuts, may provide the same price stability due to the high demand in the Maputo and local markets. However, to confirm this, further market analysis is required. Irrigators could benefit from these stable markets, but profit might be limited. Non-traditional crops have a greater risk due to high price volatility and susceptibility of the crops to pests and diseases, especially during the wet season. However, profitability might be higher if their harvest is better-timed and appropriate agricultural and water management practices are used. For instance, improving the timing of access to the Maputo market for cabbages would make this crop 32% more profitable compared to lettuce, cucumbers and chillies  (Sitóe, 2010) . However, the cost of inputs per hectare is very high when growing cabbages during the wet season  (Cairns et al., 2013) , and achieving this requires good farm management skills. Because of this, few farmers produce vegetables in the wet season. In the scheme, only the second-and new-generation farmers do so. Farmers are mainly producing non-traditional crops on small areas during the dry season; supply in the market is therefore very high, which results in lower prices. The short shelf life of these crops also results in high price variability. Only a few farmers have the skills and financial capacity to grow non-traditional crops during the wet season, and therefore local producers are unable to supply the market year-round. Improving farm management skills and access to input finance would enable production of non-traditional crops during the wet season. This would allow farmers to supply the retail sector all year, which is a precondition for competing with South African producers in the Maputo market. Management skills could involve staking tomatoes and applying appropriate pesticides, highlighting the critical role of extension officers and/or the ability of farmers to purchase inputs. But the challenge for local producers to access the Maputo retail market is more complex than supplying year-round. The low prices of imported South African produce make it very difficult for local producers to compete without some kind of market protection, such as limits on importation of some commodities. This would be difficult now that the Southern Region of Africa intends to become an open market. Not all irrigators can benefit from growing non-traditional crops during the wet season. Limited technical knowledge, access to inputs such as seeds and fertilizer, and information are likely to persist as challenges. Widowed farmers could produce green beans in small areas and mix them with other crops to generate cash and contribute to the family diet. This strategy could also apply to the first-and second-generation farmers. Weekend farmers produce only maize throughout the year, probably because this crop is easier to manage and because they usually sell it fresh, which fits with these farmers' high levels of absence from the farm and their reliance on hired labour. The proximity to South Africa may contribute to labour shortages in southern Mozambique and may increase the cost of labour. For these irrigators, the dry season could provide an opportunity to produce crops that are more profitable or improve their family's diet. Irrigators have difficulty gaining access to market information, which can also be infrequent and inaccurate. This presents an opportunity where extension officers can contribute to increasing profitability. Nevertheless, the small number of extension officers is a problem, which is a result of low salaries and poor working conditions  (Sitóe, 2010) . Improving extension services could make a significant difference if used strategically in areas such as information provision, organizing market access, crop management practices for the wet season and improving access to and use of inputs. Most households have a cellphone, and extension services could use this technology to disseminate information widely. Although the scheme has benefited from training in the past, it is difficult to see the results among the irrigators or the extension workers. There has been an absence of extension projects directed to irrigation. In the future, such projects should clearly be targeted at techniques adapted to the local conditions and actively involve the extension officers to ensure longevity and sustainability. Collaboration with other irrigator associations and partners, such as NGOs, could help resolve vegetable storage issues and extend the period over which products can be sold, to achieve higher prices. The study also emphasizes the need to increase the support provided to women to raise their participation in the cooperative's administration and reduce their time in the field, releasing them for other jobs, including alternative income generation. This is a long process because it requires changing long-standing cultural traditions. The scheme has provided irrigators access to a steady water supply and the use of a tractor and implements at low cost. When this article was written, a significant proportion of the canals remained unlined, which was causing water losses, long delays in transporting water to fields and increased pumping costs, and limiting water delivery to every 15 days. However, the baseline survey suggests that these issues are less constraining than access to inputs, transport, markets and extension services. 
 Conclusion Irrigator households pursue different cropping strategies depending on their access to financial and human resources, level of knowledge and skills, and dependence on agriculture as a source of income. Cropping strategies range from total reliance on traditional crops to a focus solely on non-traditional crops. Resource-poor households focus on traditional crops, as they are simpler to grow, are associated with lower production risk and price volatility and can provide both food and cash income. Resource-rich households have the resources and a greater ability to manage the challenges of producing higher-value crops, including production risks and price volatility. The amount of time that an irrigator and farm household can spend at the scheme and work in the field also influences the choice of cropping strategies. Based on resource constraints, current market conditions and price volatility, the irrigators' cropping strategies appear to be rational. While water supply reliability was not raised as an issue in the baseline survey, focus group discussions clearly indicated that it is an issue. Subsequent to this study, the remaining earthen canals were lined, which has significantly increased the speed and volume of water delivery. Consequently, field officers are currently working with scheme management to increase the available irrigation slots so farmers can irrigate once a week. However, while these strategies are important, they will not maximize the profitability of farm households and the viability of the scheme. Given the market condition and price volatility of some crops, such as tomatoes and cabbages, simply increasing the productivity of these crops will not necessarily increase profitability. Strategies and policies need to be developed to better integrate each of the farmer types into the market and the value chain and thus improve access to inputs, transport and extension services.

 THE PRESENCE OF CHINA IN AFRICA: A ROLE IN FUTURE AGRICULTURE 
 Contrary to the much-publicized idea of a/1-out activism, especially in terms of land acquisitions, the presence of China in Africa is multifaceted and should be put into perspective. Agricultural investments remain limited and target on/y a sma/1 number of countries, but agriculture is graduai/y becoming a priority forChina-Africa cooperation. • A modest investor with a strong presence Among the emerging powers (Brazil and lndia. in particular) present in Africa. China holds a unique position in t erms of cooperation policies. combining assistance programmes. direct investment. project development and rapid trade expansion. These m ultifaceted interventions include not only those of large nat ional or provincial public enterprises. the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) in particular. and the major banks (including EXIMbank and the China Africa Development Fund -CADF). but also those of small private entrepreneurs. Land acquisitions by Chinese companies concern only a small number of countries and tot al just over 120 000 ha, which puts China very far behind the economic or institutional stakeholders from the OECD or Gulf countries. Most of these large-scale acquisitions are aimed at the production of rubber. cassava (for starch). sugarcane and. to a lesser extent. oil palms. For other agricultural products. contracts with local producers are preferred. These are aimed at domestic or regional markets for rice. vegetables and fish farming. but aise at the Chinese market. This is the case for wine growing in South Africa and especially for cotton: more and more Chinese companies are buying a large share of the production f rom West Africa and Mozambique. 
 • A Key role in trade Trade between Af rica and China increased substantially over the 2000-2014 period. Total imports and exports stood at almost USD 210 billion in 2014. a level that nevertheless remains far below the amount recorded for ail 27 European Union countries (atjust over USD 360 billion). Since 2015. t he slovvdown of t he Chinese economy is impacting on African exports to China. especially for mining products. but these nevertheless account for almost a quarter of the total value of exports. While South Africa and Angola account for more than 70°/o ofChinese imports. exports toward s Africa are for bet ter distributed. although South Africa and Nigeria constit ute around 40°/o of total trade flows. The structure of trade between China and Africa is very sim ilar to that of Europe or the United States: China mainly exports machines and manufactured consumer goods. textiles. chemicals and metals: and it chiefly imports fuels and ores. The role of agriculture is smalt and accounts for only 2 to 3% of total trade. The main Chinese exports are cotton and processed wood. tomatoes and green t ea (as well as tractors) Almost 50o/o ofthese product s are sent to Benin. Togo and Nigeria. which act as ""bridgeheads"". Chinese imports mostly concern timber and raw cotton. sesame. tobacco and wool. South Africa and Zim babwe supply almost a quarter of these flows. • A special role çor agriculture Despite the above indicators that provide perspective on China's position in Africa in general. and in the agricult ural sector in particular. agriculture ""paradoxically"" remains a priorityfor Chinese policy. This sector is placed ""at the top of the agenda"". as confirmed during the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. which was held in Johannesburg in December 2015. The main instrument for China-Africa cooperation in the agricultural sector is the establishment of agricultural demonstration centres. These centres. which are relatively small in size (100 ha at most). are aimed at agricult ural experimentation (especially for improved irrigated rice seed imported from China) and technology extension. They are currently being developed and provide different levels of support to the national and regional agricultural research centres. This policy is accompanied by investment in the agri-food sectors and the revival of food crop production. This support for t he food production sector has a strategic goal. since it is aimed at preventing any food crisis in Africa f rom impacting on international market prices for commodities. especially rice. given that China is still dependent on the world market t o meet it s domestic demand. This food security objective is a key component of China's policy and of its contribution to the security of the Africa n continent. The FOCAC has. for example. announced a USD 60 billion programme for the 2016-2018 period aimed at ""helping"" Chinese companies to establish themselves in Africa. Although most of t he specific projects are not yet known. t his kind of boost will inevitably influence the dynamics of change in the agricultural sector and rural areas. •Fig .wa, mal:ze1 rlct_. vtgttli:llts, hHH Ria, maizt, whnt, , Coton, fruits, rice, O maize, vegetables ..

 Chinese foreign direct investment (FOI) remains relatively low: it accounts for only 30/ o of total Chinese FOI (70°/o of which is in Asia). although it is significant in some countries. The vast majority of thi s FOI is made in the construction and infrastructure sectors. vvith agriculture remaining marginal. But a diversification is being seen towards the agricultura l sector, with equity participation in national companies. such as in the cocoa sector by China National Cereals.

Over the years, breeders have developed new and improved varieties of cassava that have been distributed to and promoted among local farmers in sub-Saharan and South American countries  (Acheampong, 2015) . These varieties have improved characteristics or traits such as pest resistance, drought resistance, improved yield, improved micronutrient content (i.e. biofortified crops) etc. Breeders have mostly focused on improving agronomic traits of varieties that could be adopted by farmers (i.e. using participatory breeding with farmers). The main varietal characteristics important for farmers are crop yield and disease resistance -for example, new African Cassava Mosaic Disease resistant varieties may have potentially benefited Africa to the sum of $1.2 to $2.3 billion per annum  (Thresh et al., 1997) . However the end-users (i.e. processors; consumers) and their preferences have often not been taken into consideration (  Figure 1 ). Published works on the level of adoption of new varieties with reference to endusers are few and none of these have appeared to indicate the impact in economic terms with respect to investment.  Akoroda and Ikpi (1992)  reported that the annual level of adoption of new cassava varieties in southwestern Nigeria was statistically around 34% and that was above the national average.  Acheampong (2015)  published that between 1993 and 2015 the National Agricultural Research System, Ghana, officially released 18 improved cassava varieties which were high yielding, disease and pest resistant and early maturing. However, adoption of these varieties by mainly smallholder farmers was very low. Higher yield, a major focus of recent breeding research, had no effect on farmers' adoption decisions. Farmers would not see the need to adopt more productive cassava varieties when constraints to marketing were not alleviated within the value chain. While focus on high yield and disease resistance by national agricultural research systems remains imperative, adoption could be improved with greater understanding of farmers' cassava preferences for certain cassava attributes.  Bennett et al., 2012  reported that while existing cassava breeding programmes based on farmer led trait identification can have some successes, combining the breeding work with market needs will lead to higher success.  Bennett et al., 2012  recommended that a 'new alliance between demand and supply-side ends of cassava value chains should be built in order to promote a more market-driven client-oriented research'. The impact of other enabling factors such as climate change and the role of gender in the value chain on market demand was also very important. There are also few publications regarding the production and economic importance of cassava products in Africa. While the FAO give overall production of cassava (which increased by 30% in Africa between 1996 and 2013), this is not broken down into the product groups. It is the authors estimate that the most important of cassava product consumed is fresh boiled cassava, followed by gari (70% of production of Nigeria), fufu and lafun. However, these are estimates and would need to be verified. Farmers in Africa grow several cassava varieties and researchers identified over 1000 local cassava varieties in six counties (Congo, Côte d'lvoire, Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda)  (Nweke et al., 2002) . While it is not known how many new varieties have been released, the result is that some of the new varieties that breeders spent many years and money developing may not been adopted by local people because they do not meet market needs that are driven by end-user preference. There is a paucity of information in the literature that explores the relationships between cassava traits and end-user preference, especially in Africa. The review will highlight how much research has been published in this area and will seek to identify gaps in knowledge and make recommendations to help orientate future research programs that wish to take into account enduser (i.e. processor and consumer) preference whilst breeding for new or improved varieties of cassava. The paper focuses on Africa although some examples may be taken from other parts of the world and other related crops when this contributed to the discussion. 
 BACKGROUND 
 Cassava importance in the world and for food security in Africa Cassava (Manihot Esculenta Crantz) is the fifth most important staple in the world, and also the second most important staple in the least developed countries after rice both in terms of production and food quantities consumed  (FAOSTAT 2013) . In the developing world, over half a billion people depend on cassava essentially for food of which 300 million are in Africa. In Africa where cassava is used mostly for human diet and it is therefore a crucial crop for food security.  6  The use of cassava in industry for non-food purposes is present in Africa but to a limited extent compared to Asia and Latin America  (Naziri et al., 2014) . Tracing back to its history, cassava originated from South America and then was exported to other parts of the world with tropical climate such as Africa some centuries ago. Cassava has been fully integrated to the African cuisine and culture and is used in the preparation of numerous local dishes. The starchy root is the main product of cassava but the leaves can also be used for animal and human consumption  (Ufuan Achidi et al. 2005) . The crop is versatile and can be prepared into a variety of foods, but also be used as feed for animals and industrial products such as starch. In the recent years cassava has taken importance because it is drought tolerant and grows easily with little labour and in poor soils. Cassava is an easy and cheap source of carbohydrate (starch) and therefore of energy it produces often more energy per hectare than any other crop. With the global warming and increase in world population, cassava's role in food security will probably come to rise in the years to come. Though cassava crop has many qualities, it also presents a number of shortcomings. One weakness is that its nutritional value is mostly composed of starch; cassava contains very few proteins and other micronutrients of importance for a balanced diet. As a result, high consumption of cassava can lead to hidden hunger which is a deficiency of nutrients such as vitamins and minerals. In addition, some varieties of cassava contain cyanogenic glucosides that are harmful for health and therefore require careful processing in order to remove these 
 Cassava breeding The first step in developing improved varieties of cassava is the breeding process. Breeders from CGIAR and National Agricultural Research centres have taken interest in cassava realising its potential as a subsistence crop to help tackling food security issues in developing countries. Cassava is highly heterozygotic, which makes challenging to predict the phenotype of the crop. In addition most multiplication practice is vegetative using the stem of the plant to produce new plants of cassava  (Sayre et al., 2010) . Crossing (sexual reproduction of the plant) that will produce plants with combined characteristics of the parents is tricky because of the different plants having various flowering times  (Ceballos et al., 2004) . Scientific breeding of cassava only began recently compared to other crops --a few decades ago -and therefore there are not as many genetic differences between wild and improved germplasms compared to other crops that have longer breeding history. Also the vegetative multiplication rate of cassava is slow: only about 5-10 cuttings can be obtained from one plant  (Ceballos et al. 2004 ). In spite of these constraints, great progress has been made over the last 30-40 years. Major traits such as improved yield, low cyanogenic content, improved resistance/tolerance to major diseases and pests, and high dry matter have been bred into the cassava genome and improved varieties released to farmers  (Ceballos et al. 2004) . A molecular map  (Fregene et al., 1997)  was first developed and published in 1997. The map has been utilised in quantitative trait loci  (QTL)  mapping studies in cassava for various traits, including resistance to pests and diseases, yield, morphological and quality traits. It is now clear that this gene map has helped accelerating the 9 development of improved varieties  (Sayre et al., 2010) . Recently a high dense genetic map of cassava that includes physical localisation of immunity related genes has been developed and adds to the knowledge of the cassava genome for agronomical important traits. An aspect that has been mostly ignored by breeders however in their effort to improve cassava crop is the consideration of end-user (including processer and consumer) acceptance. Sensory characteristics (i.e. palatability) are linked to end-user acceptance and are important to ensure that the improved crop will be adopted and consumed by the local population it was purposed for. Breeding goals and activities should encompass a consideration for crop adoption and enduser acceptance  (Acheampong, 2015) . Breeders, however, need access to knowledge to understand how improved cassava varieties might be perceived by end-users and how modifying cassava quality trait might affect processing ability, sensory characteristics and consequently consumer acceptance and market demand. 
 Diversity in cassava products Throughout Africa there are numerous cassava food products that have different sensory characteristics and acceptance criteria and this complexity can provide a challenge to identifying relationships with quality traits. Acceptability of cassava products is therefore also closely dependent on the type of product and use that is proposed and these different uses of cassava shall be taken into account by the breeder. The type of products might have different quality criteria for the consumers and processors and acceptability would be also influenced by the 'cultural' sensitivities meaning 10 that different parts of the world have different likings for different products. This review is restricted to cassava products that are consumed as opposed to those that have non-food uses. Cassava products are produced through several steps of processing and many of these are common. Cassava roots undergoes peeling, followed by size reduction and boiling or soaking in the first step. This is usually followed by fermenting and pressing or cooking or drying. A large variety of products are prepared using a combination of different processes. The need for cassava roots to be processed is also linked to the presence of cyanogenic glucosides that require in some bitter high-cyanide varieties numerous steps of processing in order to detoxify the product. In addition, within the same product categories, there are differences in the process (fermentation duration, cooking temperature, extent of drying, etc.), which will lead to variants in the final product in order to meet local preferences and traditions. Variations in the process will have an impact on the sensory quality of the product and hence on consumer acceptability. 
 End-user acceptance End-users are consumers of the cassava products and processors could also be included as endusers. End-user acceptance is mainly influenced by the sensory perception of the product. 
 Sensory perception Sensory perception of the product will relate to the appearance, odour, texture and taste of the cassava product. Sensory characteristics of a product are attributes that describe a product in terms of appearance (e.g. colour: white or off-white), odour (e.g. fermented or not), texture (e.g. soft or hard), and taste (e.g. sweet or not sweet). The product should be characterised in terms of sensory attributes that will be then related to end-user acceptance. Breeding to improve cassava traits may also influence sensory characteristics of the cassava products. End-users are susceptible to perceive that the cassava product presented to them has different characteristics to the one they are used to consume. Some of the changes in cassava traits may be perceived in a positive or negative way by end-users and therefore affect acceptance. 
 Processor acceptance Processor acceptance is linked to the quality of the roots, their ability to be processed and also to the yield of the processed product from roots. Processors are looking to maximise yields of products for business purposes. Processor acceptance is related to some physiological properties of the raw material (e.g. postharvest physiological deterioration, storage ability, limited postharvest deterioration, absence of disease, pests), to some processing properties of the roots (e.g. easiness of peeling, grating, fermentation, cooking), and to physicochemical properties (i.e. dry matter content, starch content, low cyanide content etc.). 
 End-user preference End-user consumer acceptance or preference is related to the sensory perception, and other factors such as the cooking quality, root size, appearance, odour, texture and taste, of the cassava products. In addition the perception of a safe product (containing low cyanide), price or willingness to pay are important for consumer acceptability. The consumer can react three different ways when tasting a product:  The consumer likes the product. This leads to potential acceptance of the product but will be influenced by availability of the product, interaction with competing products and marketing and promotion within the market space.  The consumer dislikes the product. This leads to potential rejection of the product but will be influenced by price, availability of alternatives and marketing and promotion. The consumer neither likes nor dislikes the product. This will mean a neutral attitude but this implies a lack of incentive to buy the product unless other benefits are associated. To measure consumer acceptance or liking, standard hedonic scales have been developed to effectively give a measurement of consumer acceptance. The most common is the 9-point standard hedonic scale ranging from 1 = extremely dislike and 9 = extremely like  (Meilgaard et al., 2007) . A minimum of 50-60 consumers are required for the statistical analysis to be valid. Results from literature papers that interviewed less than this number of consumers however, illustrate weaknesses in the application of the methodology and the results of such studies have to be taken with precaution  (Bechoff et al., 2015a) . Recent sensory techniques such as Penalty analysis  (Varela and Ares 2014)  are useful to determine the drivers for food acceptance, that are characteristics or attributes of the product that will drive the acceptance either positively (acceptance of the product will increase if it has this particular characteristic or trait) or negatively (acceptance of the product will increase if it has this particular characteristic or trait). A more global picture of consumer and end-user acceptance should also encompass consideration for market demand and other factors that may influence user uptake and crop/product adoption: i.e. price, competing products, availability, constancy of supply and access to markets, domestic, regional and international trade. Market demand will drive uptake of new products (i.e. new breeding products). Potential substitutes and competing products to cassava should be examined.  Figure 2  summarises the typical relationships between cassava traits and end-user acceptance. Genetics and environment have been demonstrated to influence the physicochemical composition of the root in the ground and therefore on the cassava traits. After harvest, cassava roots will be stored and processed. Conditions of storage and processing (type of product; equipment etc.) will also affect the final characteristics and composition of the processed cassava. Processors evaluate the quality and acceptability of the roots under its raw form whilst consumers evaluate the quality of the processed product. Consumers who buy 14 roots (i.e. in the market) will evaluate the quality of both raw (at the buying and processing stages) and processed cassava (at the consuming stage). It will be market demand, however, that will determine which attributes and traits are successful. Other external factors such as climate change, scarcity of the crop, season etc. will influence the demand and therefore the preference for fresh crop or processed product  (Bennett et al., 2012; Acheampong, 2015) . 
 WHAT ARE THE EXISTING ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA IN RELATION WITH SENSORY PROPERTIES 
 FOR DIFFERENT CASSAVA PRODUCTS In order to understand which quality traits are better accepted by the end-users it is important to consider the different types of products from cassava because of their diverse sensory and physicochemical properties. 1) non-fermented products prepared using a single step process after peeling (boiling or frying) that applies mainly to low cyanide sweet cassava varieties; and the intermediate cassava products such as dried cassava chunks, flour and starch; and 2) fermented products that are made by several steps of processing because they are made mostly using the higher cyanide bitter type varieties that requires cyanide detoxification or because they meet local preferences. Roots undergo either fermentation under water -fermentation (submerged fermentation or soaking) or on the grated mash (solid-state fermentation). The scope of the review will be limited to products from roots rather than from leaves. It should however be noted that cassava leaves play an important role in cassava acceptance and some varieties are adopted based on the quality of the leaves eaten as a vegetable, in particular in Central Africa (Congo, DRC, Centre Afrique, Gabon)  (Ufuan Achidi et al. 2005 ). Moreover the review will concentrate on products made from 100% cassava roots and not from mixtures because of the interference between cassava and other ingredients that will make difficult to relate acceptability to cassava traits. Acceptability criteria for the groups are summarised in  Table 1  and discussed below. 
 Non-fermented products made in a single step process Non-fermented products are made from sweet varieties of cassava (that may contain low levels of cyanogenic compounds). Processes involve only a single step after peeling because it is sufficient to reduce the cyanide level to a safe level for human consumption. These products comprise boiled and fried cassava. 
 Boiled cassava Texture i.e. softness is a very important criterion for the sensory quality of boiled cassava. Varieties that do not cook very well can still be hard after a prolonged period of cooking therefore affecting the acceptability of the product.  Favaro et al., 2008 and Hongbété et al., 16  2011 also stressed that friability or mealiness was universally cited by consumers as the most important quality attribute of boiled cassava. 
 Fried cassava Peeled cassava roots can be fried either as large chunks or as medium-size or as smaller-size slices such as fried chips.  Grizotto and De Menezes, 2002  showed that crispness and friability were quality criteria for fried cassava. In addition  Vitrac et al., 2001  reported that crisp quality was depending on oil content, colour and texture for the same dehydration level. 
 Non-fermented products made into industrial products: dried raw cassava products Non-fermented products comprise dried chips, pellets, starch and high quality cassava flour  (Table 1) . These are often intermediate or industrial products that are used in the making of more elaborated food products from cassava. These products are in most cases non-fermented because the quality can be better controlled on non-fermented products rather than on spontaneously fermented products. Although users perception for these intermediate products is important these products firstly have to comply with quality standards because of their nature as industrial products. 
 Dried chips Chopping and drying cassava is a current practice in Asia for animal feed and industrial uses and the use of dried chips and pellets for export are widely becoming increasingly popular in Africa. Drying cassava is also a convenient way of storing cassava that will be made into flour. Chips or pellet shape and uniformity as well as moisture content are important criteria for acceptability of dried cassava  (Falade and Akingbala, 2010) . 
 Cassava starch Edible cassava starch (ARS:846 2012) is a neutral (odourless; bland in taste; not sour) product with a small particle size and a minimum of 95% cassava starch. 
 Cassava flour Standard criteria for High Quality Cassava Flour (HQCF) are given  (ARS 840 (2012) .  Shittu et al., 2007  found that the physicochemical properties of different HQCF from CMV resistant varieties greatly differ (starch content; viscosity etc.) and therefore the applications for the flour could be various. Variability in functional properties of the HQCF therefore opens opportunities for uses of HQCF in diverse industrial, food and non-food applications. Overall major acceptability criteria for non-fermented products are that the final product should be not bitter and also sweet. Varieties with high dry matter content are generally preferred because of the texture, which is firmer and less moist. 
 Products fermented by (water) submersion Common examples of products fermented by water submersion include fufu, lafun and chikwangue  (Table 1 ). Fermentation has been ancestrally used as a means of preservation for products. Fermentation of cassava is a way to develop specific and appreciated product flavours and a grating step can help detoxify the product from cyanogens. Fermentation by submersion or also called water retting is a common process in humid areas where drying of products may be an issue. 
 Fufu Fufu in Nigeria is a fermented dough made from cassava that is steeped as whole or sliced peeled roots in water and allowed to ferment for three days maximum. The fermented roots are then sieved and cooked to produce a homogeneous looking paste. In Central Africa (i.e. Cameroon, Gabon) and some parts of Nigeria the paste is dried into a flour that can be stored longer than fresh fufu. Fufu is ranked second in importance after gari in Nigeria (IITA, Cassava 
 Biz 2005). Fufu of good quality had homogeneous colour, was smooth, slightly sticky and stretchy  (Opare-Obisaw et al., 2004; Falade and Akingbala, 2010) . Although Opare-Obisaw et al., 2004 described the ideal taste of fufu as bland, other authors showed that the distinct fufu flavour and sourness were appreciated by consumers  (Oyewole and Ogundele, 2004; Falade and Akingbala, 2010; Tomlins et al., 2007) . The strong smell of fufu generated through fermentation however is not always liked by fufu consumers. The National Root Crop Institute (NRCRI) based in Umudike, Nigeria developed a process to make odourless fufu  (Omodamiro et al., 2012)  in order to respond to those consumers who do not like the strong smell of fufu.  Tomlins et al., 2007  noted a difference in acceptance rating in fufu products related to purchasing behaviour of males and females. When testing of acceptance of fufu among 300 consumers in urban centres in Nigeria, men (artisans and professionals) were more likely to want to purchase fufu in the wet form while women (younger in age, teachers and students) were more interested to purchase as flour. This difference, however, may be due to lifestyle differences because this was confounded with gender. Tastes of different types of consumers should be accounted for if possible when looking at fufu preference. 
 Lafun Lafun is a fibrous cassava powder that is reconstituted into a paste similarly to dried fufu in Nigeria. The method of production of lafun is different from that of fufu. In the traditional lafun preparation, fresh peeled cassava roots are cut into chunks and steeped for 3-4 days or until the roots become soft. Roots are then sun-dried for several days and milled into flour and reconstituted into a paste by addition of boiling water. Unlike fufu the fibres are still contained in lafun, which gives it a coarser texture  (Cassava Biz, 2005) . Lafun has similar quality criteria to fufu. In addition, a fast gelatinisation during cooking was appreciated. 
 Chikwangue and 'bâton de manioc' Chikwangue or also called cassava bread and similar products such as 'bâton de manioc' are common forms of cassava consumption in Central Africa, in mostly francophone countries (i.e. Cameroon, Gabon, Congo). Chikwangue and 'bâton de manioc' are prepared by peeling, and chopping roots into chunks that are left covered in water (sometimes running water --such as a stream or river) for about 2 days. Afterwards central fibres are removed, the pieces washed with clear water, squeezed and made into a smooth paste. The paste is then wrapped in young leaves (Megaphrynium macrostachyum, or other species of Marantaceae) bound with raffia and boiled  (O'Brien et al., 1992; Agbor-Egbe and Mbome, 2006) . Boiling/steaming can be carried out in one or more stages: sometimes the product is pregelatinised in the first cooking and later further cooked. Odour, taste, elasticity and stickiness were important criteria . These different processing variants conveydiverse sensory characteristics to chikwangue and 'bâton'. Interestingly, preferences of chikwangue were influenced by gender, tribe, location, urban or rural origin whereas other products did not show such influence . 
 Solid state fermented products Solid state fermented products comprise agbelima, gari and attieke  (Table 1) . Peeled roots grated into a mash (solid state) are allowed to ferment for various durations. Most times, fermentations are spontaneous. Durations of fermentation vary from a few hours to several days. The products may be dried (semolina form. i.e. gari and attieke) or wet (i.e. agbelima). 
 Agbelima Agbelima is a fermented cassava meal widely consumed in Ghana, Togo and Benin. The first steps of processing include peeling, grating and fermenting such as most cassava fermented products. However contrary to the gari and fufu products that undergo spontaneous fermentation, the preparation of agbelima incurs addition of a traditional inoculum called kudeme, which aids fermentation and breaks down the texture of the product through the activity of a number of tissue degrading enzymes  (Dziedzoave et al., 1999) . The product is mostly consumed as a wet form. Quality specifications for agbelima were developed  (Dziedzoave, 1996; Dziedzoave et al., 1999; Dziedzoave et al., 2000) . Three important criteria of acceptability were bright white colour, smoothness and taste. 
 Gari Gari is a semolina-like cassava product with a slight sour taste that is made by peeling, grating roots followed by fermentation and/or pressing and roasting & drying. Gari is widely consumed in West Africa in particular. Gari is processed in a variety of ways and may have varying levels of fermentation and granular size. In Benin, there are numerous qualities and types of gari and some types are made from sweet cassava varieties and are not fermented. In Nigeria, gari is the main staple food from cassava and accounts for more than a third of the cassava produced. Gari can equally be eaten as it is, or sprinkled on other food or diluted into water/milk with sugar or reconstituted with boiling water into a thick paste (called eba in Nigeria and piron in Benin). Gari quality is judged by its swelling capacity, colour, particle size, moisture content, and a slight sour taste was appreciated  (Blanshard et al.,1994; Achinewhu et al., 1998; Oduro et al., 2000; Irtwange and Achimba, 2009; Ray and Sivakumar 2009; Owuamanam et al., 2010; Owuamanam et al., 2010) . 
 Attieke Attieke is a semolina-like product made from cassava. The initial steps of preparation are similar to gari (peeling, rasping, fermentation & pressing, sieving) but the latter steps involve a steaming in place of roasting. In order to store longer it could be dried (using sun or artificial drying) and later rehydrated by another steaming. Attieke has a slight sour taste and is similar to couscous in appearance  (Djeni et al., 2011) . It is very popular in Ivory Coast and consumed in many countries in West Africa.  Djeni et al., 2011  reported that quality samples were homogenous (granules of equal sizes), did not have extraneous matter, were not too sour, had a pleasant odour and were sweet.  Nimaga et al., 2012  showed that the fermenting conditions (type of starter; quantity of starter; fermentation time) significantly influenced the sensory characteristics of attieke and therefore on its acceptance. More research will be needed to understand the effect of cassava variety on the quality and sensory characteristics of attieke. The main quality and acceptance criteria differ for different cassava products. The products are found in different forms: dry (gari; lafun, fufu) or wet (fufu, agbelima, chikwangue, attieke); paste (fufu, agbelima, gari) or granulous (gari; attieke) and flour like (HQCF, starch, fufu and lafun). This may explain why the criteria for acceptance vary. Overall, independently of the product, the two main quality criteria are lack of extraneous matter and homogeneity (i.e. colour, texture, taste). Texture is a very important quality criterion for acceptance of cassava products. Paste or dough are most liked when they are smooth (or soft), elastic and sticky. For gari an important criteria is the ability to swell when made into eba or piron (by adding boiling water). Swelling power is also important for attieke. Colour criteria (e.g. cream; white or yellow) vary according to the nature of the product. A gari made with palm oil would have an acceptable yellow colour whilst a gari made with local roots would be white or cream in appearance. Overall flavour and smell to be acceptable to the end-users should be typical of the product but they should not be too strong because these products are used as staples to accompany food that will give the flavour (vegetable; sauce; meat; fish) to the dish. In some products and for some consumers a slight acid taste is appreciated (e.g. gari, attieke). In other products (e.g. fufu) and for other consumers, a taste or smell close to neutral is preferred. 
 HOW DO WE RELATE PHYSICOCHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS TO SENSORY PROPERTIES AND CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE? 
 Cassava traits A trait is a distinguishing quality or characteristic, attribute, feature, quality, property. For breeders a trait refers to a genetically determined characteristic that is associated to a specific phenotype. There are more than 200 traits associated to cassava phenotype, and these can be classified into five different types: agronomic; biotic stress, morphological, physiological and quality traits. The main quality traits for cassava have been reorganised and are listed below  (Table 2) . 
 Cassava chemical composition Cassava traits are closely linked to chemical composition and sometimes confounded with it. The chemical constituents comprise the macronutrients (carbohydrates: starch, pectins, sugars, fibres, organic acids and ash) and the micronutrients (vitamins, minerals). There are also antinutritional compounds (i.e. cyanogens). In addition quality traits may include textural properties, dry matter and product yield. 
 Macronutrients Of the nutrients in cassava, carbohydrate, and in particular starch is the main component (85% on a dry weight basis)  (Sánchez et al., 2009; Sayre et al., 2011)  and is the main constituent that will influence physicochemical characteristics, functional and sensory properties, and consequently it will affect end-user acceptability. Starch is formed of amylopectin (70-80%) and amylose (20-30%). Starch quality and properties are linked to the amylose/amylopectin ratio. There is also a genetic link between starch content and dry matter content.  Sánchez et al., 2009  working on 4044 cassava genotypes coming from different parts of the world recorded variable dry matter contents varying between 14 and 48% and starch contents between 65 and 95% on a dry weight basis. Amylose varied between 15.2 and 26.5 with 20.7% on average. Starch quality and quantity is governed by genes and thus the variety will influence but also the environment (climate and ambient temperature; rain or drought, soil type, use of fertilisers and geographical area).  Table 3  summarises the proximate, vitamin and mineral composition of cassava roots.. Cassava contains more carbohydrates than potatoes, and cereals such as wheat, rice, maize and sorghum. The main simple sugars are sucrose, glucose, fructose and maltose. According to  Sánchez et al., 2009  total sugars and reducing sugars in cassava roots were 3.7% and 1.2% on average (with variations between 0.2% -18.8%) and 0%-15.7%), respectively. Protein and lipid contents were low in cassava (respectively less than 3.5% and 0.5%), and showed that cassava roots had poor nutritional value. The lipid content was low compared to maize and sorghum but higher than potato and comparable to rice.  (Montagnac et al., 2009 ). Considering the protein content,  Yeoh and Truong, 1996  demonstrated that the classical nitrogen-to-protein conversion factor (6.25) was not valid when working with cassava and that the real conversion factor is around 3.24. This indicates that the levels of protein given in  Table   3  should actually be even lower. In contrast to cassava roots, maize and sorghum whole grain have about 10-12% (dry basis) of protein. Half of the protein content in cassava roots consists of proteins whilst the other half consists of amino acids. Some essential amino acids, such as methionine, cysteine, and tryptophan are found in very low amounts however roots contain substantial amounts of arginine, glutamate and aspartate  (Montagnac et al., 2009 ). Nonprotein components are nitrite, nitrate and cyanogenic acids. Cyanogenic potential varied between 14 and 3274 ppm, with 340 ppm on average  (Sánchez et al., 2009 ). The protein content in the leaves was 30% in fresh weight and showed that leaf protein could be a supplement to the roots that had very low protein content. According to  Chavez et al.(2000)  there should be space for genetic improvement in protein in cassava roots by means of genetic engineering. 
 Minerals and vitamins Cassava roots contain calcium, iron, potassium, magnesium, copper, zinc, and manganese in amounts comparable to those of many legumes except soybeans. According to  Montagnac et al., 2009 , using a compilation of several references on cassava, calcium content in roots comprised between 16 and 176 mg/100 g fresh weight, and calcium levels were relatively high compared to that of other staple crops  (Montagnac et al., 2009)  (  Table 3) . Average levels of iron and zinc were 9.6 mg/kg and 6.4 mg/kg (dry weight basis) respectively  (Chavez et al., 2000) . These were very low concentrations according to  Burns et al. (2012) . Studies to improve the levels of iron and zinc in cassava have encountered some challenges because of the very low baseline levels and current biofortification programmes for cassava are mainly aiming at enhancing carotenoid levels. Provitamin A carotenoid contents were variable but overall quite low in roots compared to leaves (factor of about 1000 times less)  (Montagnac et al., 2009) . Cassava roots also contain low amounts of the B vitamins (thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin) that may be lost during processing  (Table 3) .  Montagnac et al., 2009  concluded that mineral and vitamin contents are mostly lower in cassava roots than in most cereals, legumes and some other root and tuber crops. Their nutritional content would require some improvement. In addition to the agronomical traits, quality traits such as reduced cyanide content, starch and protein, micronutrient (iron, zinc and vitamins) content and quality are listed in  Table 3 . Breeding to improve cassava traits (i.e. using genetic engineering or conventional breeding) has to be watched closely because modifications in a particular trait might have impact on other characteristics of the roots (epistasis).  Cach et al., 2005  reported that there is paucity of knowledge on the inheritance of agronomic traits in cassava and the importance of epistasis. It however appears that epistasis is very likely to occur for non-negligible number of traits in cassava. In particular, the authors suggested that dominance of genes play an important role in complex traits such as root yield. 
 Starch, dry matter and influence on texture Texture of cassava products is a critical factor for consumer acceptance. According to the local consumers of cassava products in Nigeria, texture is the most important criterion for acceptance of the products before taste and smell. Because cassava products are not eaten by themselves, the side dish brings the flavour whilst the cassava dish brings the texture to the dish. Most of the textural change in roots and tubers during ripening or processing are related to pectin and starch content and composition, i.e. amylose/amylopectin ratio. Starch content and composition (amylose/amylopectin) influence the texture rather than the taste and other sensory attributes. Texture is an important characteristic that will impact consumer acceptability and preference for products  (Ross et al., 2011) . However texture is linked to several elements: genetics, environment and processing, and the factors that are responsible for texture in cassava are still not fully investigated. As for potato  (Taylor et al., 2007; Ross et al., 2011)  a large number of factors influences cassava texture such as starch content, starch distribution within the root, starch swelling pressure, cell size, cell wall structure and composition and its breakdown during cooking  (Beleia et al., 2006) . Texture is therefore likely to involve many genes. The cooking process will have a fundamental effect on the starch by making it gelatinise. Gelatinisation will therefore have a critical effect on the texture of the cassava product.  Sanni et al., 2004  reported significant correlations between sensory texture of fufu and some pasting properties of cassava starch (by using Rapid Visco Analyser): a negative correlation with peak viscosity or starch stability, and a positive correlation with setback value for the fufu samples were observed.  Dziedzoave et al., 1999  working on agbelima showed significant correlations between sensory descriptors scored by panellists (36 people using a 4 point intensity scale) and physicochemical measurements: smoothness was related to particle uniformity and a weak correlation was found between cohesiveness and starch content.  Padonou et al., 2005  showed that there was a significant relationship between mealiness and firmness of boiled cassava roots measured using a texture analyser and that firmness was significantly correlated with apparent viscosity after pasting (using a Rapid Viscosity Analyser). Mealiness also has been shown to generally increase with dry matter content. There have been attempts to correlate starch content or starch properties with the mealiness of boiled potato. It was reported that starch swelling resulted in softening potato cell walls however no clear relationship was found between starch content and starch properties with mealiness. On the other hand, studies on potato clearly show a relationship between pectins content and mealiness  (Ross et al., 2011) . On cassava, the relationship remains to be proven. Waxy mutant cassava varieties have been developed by CIAT in collaboration with other research institutes. These genetically modified varieties have very low amylose content and could be used in the making of industrial products with specific gelatinisation properties and specific uses  (Zhao et al., 2011) . Sensory attributes that drive consumer acceptance such as cohesiveness, smoothness, swelling, and in some extent mealiness are all linked to the starch composition and gelatinisation process. 
 Pectin and influence on mealiness and firmness Hongbété et al., 2011 found that although starch might have an influence, pectins are more likely to be the major biochemical factor in relation with mealiness.  Jarvis et al., 2003  commented that starch swelling pressure played a role in cell separation in cooked vegetables, but degradation of the pectic polymers involved in cell adhesion was also necessary for cell separation. These findings are in accordance with  Favaro et al., 2008  who worked on two varieties of cassava that had different cooking times. Softening of cell walls during cooking was studied in relation with intracellular compounds such as cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+), phytic acid and pectins. It appeared that the cultivar with the longer cooking time had lower level of cations, phytic acid, and higher levels of chelator-insoluble pectic polysaccharides. It is therefore suspected that pectins have a major role in mealiness. Pectins play an important role in cell adhesion in fruits and vegetables and mealiness can result from a high degree of cell separation due to pectin degradation or solubilisation (i.e. during cooking) commented  Jarvis et al., 2003 . Solubility of pectins increased with temperature and would lead to a decrease in the shear force (compression) in cassava roots  (Menoli and Beleia, 2007) .  Hongbété et al., 2011  noted that it is likely that mealiness is associated to pectins in cassava. A recent study on sweet potato indicated that two enzymes: pectin methylesterase (PME) (that catalyses deesterification of pectin into pectate and methanol) and amylase (starch degrading enzyme) played an important role in firmness: a low temperature blanching preserved some PME activity and increased the firmness of the gel and decreased free starch rate  (He et al., 2014) . PME and cellulase appeared to play an important role in the softening of cassava roots during fermentation and PME and -amylase production were shown to increase during fufu fermentation.  (Oyewole and Odunfa, 1992) . PME is an interesting enzyme because it can have two opposite effects: one is a contribution to the firmness of the cell wall  (He et al., 2014)  by producing unesterified carboxyl groups that interact with calcium ions forming a pectate gel and the other is to contribute to cell wall softening  (Oyewole and Odunfa, 1992)  by releasing a proton that may induce activity of cell wall hydrolases. Mealiness is also influenced by environmental factors.  Hongbété et al., 2011  reported that rainfall before harvest had a direct effect on lowering dry matter and decreasing mealiness in boiled roots. In addition to genotype factors, environmental factors could significantly influence sensory perception of cassava products. Mealiness or friability of boiled roots is an important attribute for consumer acceptance  (Hongbété et al., 2011)  since boiled or fried root should not be too hard for the consumer to eat.  Djeni et al., 2011  showed that were a strong correlation between sweetness and reducing sugar content in attieke. Therefore the sweetness perceived in cassava products is probably directly linked to their concentration in reducing sugars. 
 Sugars and influence on taste Sweetness is often a driver of food acceptability in general. Little work has been reported on acceptability of cassava related to sweetness. Quality of fresh cassava is evaluated by farmers, traders and processors who sell or buy the fresh roots. Working with CMD (cassava mosaic disease) and CBSD (cassava brown streak disease) resistant varieties,  Saleh et al., 2004 sought  to understand acceptance of these improved resistant and high yielding varieties compared to local breeds that were prone to common virus disease and pests and low yields. Clones (ZNZ/98/036; ZNZ/98/034 and ZNZ/98/084) were selected by the farmers because of several preference characteristics including disease resistance, high root yielding, dry root matter content and sweetness (evaluated by farmers on a 5 point-scale),  (Saleh et al., 2004) . Sweetness was included as a criterion for clone selection. Another study by  Tumuhimbise et al., 2012 , showed that the second more desirable characteristic in early bulking storage cassava cultivars was sweetness (the most desirable characteristics being high dry matter content). These findings indicate that sweetness is indicated as one of the drivers for acceptability of cassava by farmers. 
 Carotenoids and influence on root flesh colour appearance, taste, smell and texture Most cassava grown in Africa is of white or cream flesh colour. Recently biofortified varieties that have a yellow flesh colour due to increased provitamin A content have been introduced. Since these novel varieties have a different but visible trait (the yellow colour)  (Njoku et al., 2011)  understanding of the perception and acceptance will be very important. These cassava Carotenoid content was found to be highly correlated with the colour of cassava flesh  (Chavez et al. 2000; Ceballos et al., 2013; Bechoff et al, 2015) : white, cream, yellow, deep yellow, orange root colour corresponded to values of 1; 4; 6; 8 and more than 12 (max. 25.8) ug/g fresh weight basis respectively. Total carotenoid content and colour intensity were strongly and positively associated, suggesting that simple screening based on visual scoring of colour was satisfactory for initial selection of the roots of cassava clones with relatively high total carotenoid content  (Sánchez et al., 2006; Blagbrough et al., 2010) .  Sánchez et al., 2014  working on more than 3000 samples demonstrated that there was a linear correlation between colour measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) or visible colour chromatometer and carotenoid levels. NIRS or chromatometry can therefore improve selection protocols by allowing faster carotenoid determination from cassava clones that might be useful in screening stages for breeding  (Sánchez et al., 2014) .  Ceballos et al., 2013  managed to develop a rapid cycling recurrent selection for high carotenoid content cultivars that was reduced from the ordinary eight years to three years. Data clearly showed that clones with higher carotenoid levels were obtained at each cycle of selection. In addition to gaining carotenoids, some clones were also gaining in dry matter content. This is an interesting finding because it shows that the genetic link between high carotenoid and low dry matter content could potentially be overcome in cassava using selective breeding. However some local cassava products such as gari can be prepared with palm oil containing carotenoids, which also transfers a yellow colour (and carotenoids) to the product  (Bechoff et al., 2015b) .  Bechoff et al., 2014  working on local (white), with and without palm oil, biofortified yellow cassava fufu and eba products (TMS 01/1371; 01/1368; 01/1412) also found that biofortified products were acceptable (with a score  7 (like moderately)) to the local Nigerian consumers (n = 122). The gari prepared with palm oil and with yellow cassava do not significantly differ in terms of appearance (  Figure 4B ). Therefore although yellow colour is a visible trait in the root, the final product (gari with palm oil) does not differ in colour from the product people are used to consume. The vitamin A activity of palm oil gari and biofortified gari of the same colour respectively were about 300 and 200 RAE (Retinol Activity Equivalent), respectively  (Bechoff et al. 2015b ). Oparinde et al., 2012 worked on the acceptability of conventionally bred biofortified cassava products (eba and gari) in West and Eastern parts of Nigeria. The authors found that biofortified yellow cassava was acceptable to the consumer compared to the traditional local (white varieties) and white with added palm oil. Varieties used were TMS 01/1371 and 01/1368. Genetically Modified (GM) cassava with high provitamin A content (of yellow colour) was tested for consumer acceptability in Brazil  (González et al., 2009) . Although the acceptability of GM cassava was high (using the willingness-to-pay approach), the research suggests that the varieties will be more acceptable to the population if they were obtained by conventional techniques. This is because a small number of interviewees had resistance against GM crops because of ethical and health risk concern. Further investigation suggests that a confounding ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 35 factor is that the GM crops had very low dry matter content  (González et al., 2009 ) and this might have been a hurdle to consumer acceptance. More research on the consumer acceptance of GM cassava with high carotenoid content might be needed. Contrary to gari, fufu is not prepared with the addition of palm oil. Therefore biofortified yellow fufu had a different trait to the local and white fufu. Bechoff et al., 2014 also tested yellow fufu from biofortified cassava in South-West of Nigeria and found it acceptable. The authors showed that the main drivers (selected by the consumers) for acceptance of the products were 'smoothness'; 'yellow colour'; 'good for eye sight'; 'good for health' and 'mouldable'. Sourness had a negative effect on consumer acceptance. Interestingly, yellow colour was an acceptance criterion; the colour might have been associated with health benefits of biofortified products in the mind of the consumers. Moreover, coloured products were more acceptable than white local products the people were accustomed to. However, yellow cassava roots had lower dry matter and this may lead to lower acceptance by processors due to the lower yields of gari compared to white cassava.  Talsma et al., 2013  tested the acceptance of boiled biofortified cassava 97/1170 with school children in Kenya. Biofortified cassava was preferred over the local variety because of its soft texture, sweet taste and attractive colour. Knowledge about biofortified cassava and benefits to health had strong influence on the consumer behaviour. The authors reported that children (30) and caretakers (30) perceived a significant difference between the taste of the yellow cassava and the white local one (ex-Mariakam) that was boiled. The difference was perceived independently of the colour. This finding was in agreement with  Bechoff et al., 2014 who  found that people are able to distinguish between biofortified and local cassava products in a blind test. While for cassava there is no published work that relates carotenoid content to visual rating of colour, this has been demonstrated for other root and tuber crops such as sweet potato  (Tomlins et al., 2012) . In summary, increasing the carotenoid content did not only influence colour but also softer texture and sweeter taste. Biofortified cassava products developed by conventional breeding methods is more acceptable to consumers in hedonic and willingness to pay tests. GMO biofortified cassava product was less acceptable but may be confounded with a lower dry matter content. Yellow cassava products are already commonly consumed due to the addition of palm oil containing provitamin A. 
 Minerals (zinc and iron) and taste Zinc and iron deficiencies are two other major micronutrient deficiencies aside vitamin A. 
 Chavez et al., 2000 initially suggested that not only the carotenoid content of cassava varieties can be improved but also their content in zinc and iron. The levels of zinc and iron were measured in existing cassava varieties and authors suggested that cassava varieties could be adapted to deliver higher levels of zinc and iron that could help tackling micronutrient deficiencies. The anti-nutrients (e.g. phytates; tannin) present in these crops and deterring the absorption of iron and zinc will also have to be taken into account. However a modification in the anti-nutrient content can also affect the plant metabolism and has to be watched carefully  (Bouis and Welch, 2010) . Later trials have shown that the biofortification of cassava with iron and zinc is more complex than expected and therefore most likely requires the input of genetic engineering. Genetically Modified techniques are actively pursuing the enhancement of iron and zinc in cassava (i.e. Danforth Center, USA) and conventional biofortification programs for cassava have now focused solely on carotenoid biofortification (Dufour D. Pers. Comm. 2015). Minerals were not found to be associated with visible traits in other crops (e.g. biofortified high iron beans) and similar findings are likely with cassava. 
 Cyanide and bitter taste High cyanide content in cassava has traditionally been associated with bitter taste  (Bokanga, 1994) . A study by  Chiwona-Karltun et al., 2004  showed that bitter taste was correlated to cyanide level when tasted raw by farmers.  Saleh et al., 2004  also reported a significant correlation (R = 0.94) between sweetness perceived by the farmers and cyanide content in the roots and this would be attributed to bitterness: the more bitter the varieties the less sweet they would be perceived. There is still a debate however on whether the cyanide level could be directly linked to the perceived bitterness.  King and Bradbury, 1995  commented that the bitterness was not directly linked to the linamarin content but rather to another compound called isopropyl-β-D-apiofuranosyl-(1 6)-β-D-glucopyranoside (IAG, structure I).  Hongbété et al.,  2011 working on boiled roots did not find a clear correlation between bitterness and cyanogen potential. The authors commented that bitter cultivars often contain more soluble sugars that sweet ones do and therefore these cultivars were not scored bitter by the panellists. But overall most studies prove that bitterness is correlated to cyanogenic potential. Literature was scare on the consumer acceptance for bitter taste and may in part be related to ethical concerns in conducting such tests. In general bitter taste is not unanimously appreciated by consumers. Bitterness tends to be more of a negative taste than a positive one. It seems that bitter taste might not be acceptable to the cassava consumer also because of the association with cyanide risk. However research studies  (Bokanga, 1994; Chiwona-Karltun et al., 1998; Mkumbira et al., 2003)  showed that farmers clearly preferred bitter varieties because they were less susceptible to pests and diseases and also to theft. Breeding studies should consider liking of farmers that prefer high cyanide varieties. Adequate processing steps may be a sufficient measure to detoxify cassava to a safe level for consumption and produce a safe and non-bitter cassava product. 
 Organic acids, fermentation and acidic smell and taste Fermented sour taste is an important sensory attribute for many fermented cassava products and is linked to the presence of organic acids formed during lactic fermentation. Although formation of organic acids might be related to the starch content and composition, it is mostly depending upon fermentation duration and temperature and microflora present in the cassava. Fermentation is a common practice for cassava, especially in Africa  (Westby, 2002) . It is a way of producing a safe product that has a longer shelf-life as well as meeting consumer preferences: low pH inhibits growth of most pathogen bacteria. During fermentation, sugars are converted into organic acids by indigenous flora of lactic bacteria and yeast present in cassava mash. Owuamanam et al., 2010 demonstrated that the low pH obtained during fermentation for gari was due to the presence of organic acids such as lactic, acetic, propionic, pyruvic acids. Slightly acid cassava products are appreciated by consumers  (Owuamanam et al., 2010) . Working with agbelima from Ghana,  Dziedzoave et al., 1999  showed that there were significant correlations between sensory intensity rated by 36 panellists (using a 4 point intensity scale) and physicochemical measurements: sourness was strongly correlated with pH (negatively) and with acidity (positively).  Djeni et al., 2011  further demonstrated that acidity of attieke samples was directly proportional to the amount of organic acids present. Lactic, acetic and oxalic acids were the most common and in greatest amounts in all the samples analysed. Lactic acid was the major organic acid and amounts were found to vary significantly in different attieke types. Similarly to  Dziedoave et al., 1999, strong correlations  were found between sourness and concentration in main organic acids in the product. Sourness of the product is closely dependent on the fermentation process (microorganisms i.e. lactic bacteria and indigenous flora, temperature, oxygen and time of fermentation). But it is also somehow affected by starch level (and composition) in the cassava roots (amylases will degrade starch into sugars that will then be converted into organic acids). The relationships between starch level and sourness of the product are still being investigated. 
 Post Physiological Deterioration and influence on taste and appearance Post-harvest Physiological Deterioration (PPD) is a major issue for the preservation of cassava roots and consequently their marketing: after 2-3 days under ambient conditions, roots start to deteriorate  (Westby, 2002; Reilly et al., 2004) . A black-blue to black vascular discoloration (vascular streaking) indicates the start of PPD that then spreads to the parenchyma  (Blagbrough et al., 2010) .  Reilly et al., 2004  showed that PPD was strongly linked to an oxidative burst that resulted in biochemical changes in the root and led to its deterioration. PPD was accompanied with increase in respiration, ethylene, diterpene biosynthesis, enzyme activity (e.g. PAL; CAT; PPO; invertase; peroxidase) changes in membrane lipid and sterols, protein synthesis, and gene expression  (Beeching et al., 2002) . PPD has been associated in particular with the production of compounds called hydroxycoumarins (esculin, esculetin, scopolin and scopoletin)  (Buschman et al., 2000) . Scopoletin in particular was shown to have an important role  (Sánchez et al., 2013) . The more tolerant cultivars to PPD had higher amounts of scopoleptin. Scopoletin levels also increased during PPD, suggesting that scopoletin must be involved in reducing deterioration rate at the initial stage of PPD  (Uarrota and Maraschin, 2015) . PPD has been shown to affect the taste and appearance of cassava products. Two varieties, one susceptible to PPD (TME-1) and one resistant (improved TMS 30572) were compared over two consecutive years  (Aigbe and Remison, 2009 ). Gari products were prepared from the two varieties. Consumer acceptability (for odour, taste, texture and colour) was significantly lower in the rot susceptible variety compared to the improved variety. Hence rotting is proven to be a negative driving factor for the acceptability of gari products. A limited number of people (n = 28) were interviewed however. The results of this experiment showed that high root rot incidence of a cassava genotype in the field may reduce consumer's acceptability of the gari produced from it. Genetic susceptibility of a variety to rotting is also likely to influence the consumer acceptability. 
 Cassava age and taste, texture, colour Root age is a trait that can significantly influence on the quality and composition of roots. Most common age for harvesting cassava is 12 months after planting. However different varieties have different optimal ages for harvesting. Time of harvesting is linked to optimal maturity characteristics of the roots such as bulkiness, mealiness or cooking quality of roots explained Apea-Bah et al., 2011. Gari was prepared from four different cassava varieties: Afisiafi, Tekbankye, Abasafitaa and Gblemoduade that were harvested each month from 10 months until 15 months after planting. Consumer acceptance was tested using a 9-point hedonic scale (n = 24 assessors) for taste, colour, crispness, aroma, appearance and overall acceptability. Taste was significantly affected (p<0.01) by age at harvest. All the other sensory attributes were significantly affected (p<0.01) by age at harvest and variety. Gari prepared from older harvests (14 months and 15 months) were preferred by assessors to gari from younger harvests. Root age was shown to be an important factor on the acceptability of cassava products. 
 WHAT ARE THE GENETIC DRIVERS FOR THESE PHYSICOCHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS? Cassava phenotype is controlled by genotype and environments. If we could identify the genes controlling quality traits, then we may be able to modulate the expression of these genes by either using conventional breeding or genetic engineering to make cassava more appealing to the end-users and with better nutritional quality traits. A first step in identifying the genes is to find the parts of the genome that are related to specific quality traits: quantitative trait loci (QTL) are map regions of the genome (DNA) that contain genes specifically related to a quantitative and qualitative trait (e.g. starch content; starch composition etc.). QTL are used as an early step in identifying and sequencing the actual genes underlying trait variation. The years 2000-2005 marked research on the stabilisation phase for the genetic transformation of cassava, whilst from 2005 research moved on unto more specific improvements aimed at targeted traits as quality traits such as starch, cyanide and protein  (Liu et al., 2011) . 
 Starch Amylopectin/amylose ratios are linked with starch quality and functional properties. Starch synthesis is regulated by three key enzymes: 1) AGPase; 2) starch synthetase and 3) starch branching enzyme that have been successfully cloned. It was reported that AGPase in particular can contribute to the conversion sugar to starch. This means that transgenic plants with enhanced AGPase activity can result in improved cassava yield and increased starch content  (Liu et al., 2011)  The texture of cassava based products is an important criterion of quality and often linked to starch pasting viscosity. Thanyasiriwat et al., 2013 tentatively identify loci and candidate genes associated with the starch pasting viscosity. Fifteen Quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified. Candidate genes were identified within the QTL peak regions. The authors concluded that 'the loci identified could effectively help to improve cassava starch quality. Alleles of candidate genes should be further studied in order to better understand their effects on starch quality traits'.  Pootakham et al., 2014  further confirmed the position of controlling starch pasting properties on quantitative trait locus previously identified, and discovered a novel QTL associated with starch pasting time on Linkage Group (LG) 10. 
 Dry matter A link exists between starch and dry matter content in cassava: the greater the starch content; the higher the dry matter content. Balyejusa  Kizito et al., 2007  identified QTL controlling cyanogenic potential (CNP) and dry matter content (DMC) in cassava. Cyanogenic potential and dry matter content both had a genetic component that was heritable. This study is a first step towards developing molecular marker tools for efficient breeding of CNP and DMC in cassava. De Oliveira et al., 2012 studied the markers for different agronomic characteristics of cassava including the fresh root yield (FRY), amylose content (AC), dry matter content (DMC), and starch yield (SY). The authors found that most traits (excepted AC) had good heritability and could therefore be used to accelerate selection of high dry matter cultivars and with high yield. Chen et al., 2012 stated that in cassava breeding one of the major goals was indeed to increase root yield. The authors identified repeatability-detected-QTL (rd-QTL) for three phenotypic traits (fresh root yield, root dry matter content, and root starch content) in cassava. Twenty-five of these rd-QTLs were 44 associated to markers, and this would facilitate the breeding selection for fresh root yield, dry matter content and starch content  (Chen et al., 2012) .  Ross et al., 2011  working on reengineered potato demonstrated that overexpression of the gene PEST1 that is involved in Pectin Methyl Esterase (PME) activity resulted in transgenic potato significantly firmer than the control (wild type). There was a clear link between PME activity and firmer texture; reduced level of pectin methylation in the over-expressing transgenic lines was associated with a firmer processed texture. Because of the genetic proximity between potato and cassava, the same gene is likely to also regulate the production of PME in cassava and manipulation of the gene may result in modulating the firmness. More research is needed to investigate the relationships between firmness and PME in cassava. 
 Pectins 
 Proteins Cassava root has very low protein content. As a result high consumption of cassava if not complemented with other sources of protein may result in protein malnutrition.  Akinbo et al., 2012  suggested that the reason why root protein content is low is the breeding selection process that has over the years selected cassava with high fresh yield and disease resistance as opposed to nutritional characteristics such as protein content.  Akinbo et al., 2012  believed that increasing protein content in cassava root will improve its usefulness by transforming it into a more complete food source especially in countries where malnutrition is predominant. There have been some efforts to improve cassava protein content. Wild cassava species (Manihot esculenta ssp flabellifolia) from Brazil contain significant amounts of protein and have been examined. A cross between wild species and an improved cassava variety resulted in a hybrid that allowed the identification of QTLs for root protein. In addition a screening of cassava varieties  (Chávez et al., 2005)  from various parts of the world indicated that many clones from Central and South America had higher protein levels in the roots, probably as a result of the transfer of genes from wild relatives found in that part of the world. The diversity of protein content found in nature gives confidence that there is scope for cassava with improved protein content to be developed. Protein content could be improved -at least in leaves -in transgenic cassava that expressed an artificial storage protein under the control of CaMV 35S promoter  (Liu et al., 2011) . There is hope that a better understanding of the genes linked to protein expression will allow to produce cassava varieties with higher protein content in the future. 
 Vitamin A and β-carotene Most of the varieties containing provitamin A are currently obtained by conventional breeding. Although there have been some efforts to produce genetically modified cassava with high carotenoid content these have not been adopted because of epistasis -association between different genes (i.e. low dry matter content linked to high carotenoid content --  (Failla et al., 2012)  which rends the varieties moist and therefore less acceptable, and also concerns directly related to genetic modification. In addition, the current genetically modified varieties do not present higher levels than biofortified varieties obtained by conventional breeding  (Failla et al., 2012)  and their yields in farmers' field have not been tested or results made publicly available. In recent years, the progress in genomics and sequencing has allowed to understand better where carotenoids are located on the genome using QTL approach. QTL can now be used in breeding programs that target carotenoid accumulation in plants (biofortification)  (Giuliano, 2014) . Sequencing of potato and tomato has revealed several genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis. In both plants, phytoene synthase (PSY) is encoded by three genes, two of which expressed in most tissues (PSY1 and PSY2). In cassava, PSY is also a key regulator of carotenoid accumulation and its expression correlates with high carotenoid content  (Giuliano, 2014; Welsch et al., 2010) . A single nucleotide variation (SNP: single nucleotide polymorphism) results in overexpression of PSY and significant increase in level of carotenoids in cassava. Such variations in the gene can be obtained either by conventional breeding or genetic engineering commented  Welsch et al., 2010 . Rabbi et al., 2014  found QTL specifically related to flesh colour and hence carotenoid content. The authors reported that the gene related to carotenoid content in cassava is likely to be PSY2, in accordance with the two studies above. 
 Cyanide Several studies have looked at the genetic mapping of cyanide related genes  (Balyejusa Kizito et al., 2007; Whankaew et al., 2011) . Balyejusa  Kizito et al., 2007  stressed the fact that a trait such as cyanide level is highly influenced by environmental conditions. However the cyanide trait was proven to be heritable. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) on two different linkage groups controlling cyanide potential (CNP) were identified. It appears that one QTL for CNP and one QTL for dry matter content mapped near each other, suggesting pleiotrophy and/or linkage for both traits.  Whankaew et al., 2011  working with low and high cyanide cultivars also identifying QTL responsible for cyanide (CN): five QTL underlying CN were detected. Among all the identified QTL, CN09R1 was the most significantly associated with the CN trait and explained the greatest percentage of phenotypic variation. Both authors concluded that QTL can provide useful markers to assist in cassava breeding and studying genes affecting the trait. The genes responsible for cyanide in roots are under investigation.  Liu et al., 2011  commented that overexpression of hydroxynitrile lyase can decrease acetone cyanohydrin content in roots. Reengineered cassava with cloned hydroxynitrile lyase had reduced cyanide level after processing; in fact, the total quantity of linamarin and lotaustralin did not change but the ability of cassava to reduce acetone cyanohydrin and consequently cyanide greatly increased. Therefore modulating the expression of hydroxynitrile lyase had an influence on the cyanide level in roots. 
 Physiological Post-harvest Deterioration (PPD) It has been clearly demonstrated that the biochemical changes that occur during PPD are linked to a change in gene expression  (Beeching et al., 2002) .  Reilly et al., 2004  affirmed that reducing PPD through conventional breeding will be a challenge with cassava because of the existing link between dry matter and PPD. The authors suggested that genetic engineering might be a better option.  Cortés et al., 2002  tentatively identified QTL for PPD in cassava and showed which major genome regions were implied in PPD. Later,  Reilly et al., 2007  showed that many genes that play a role in cellular process and oxidative mechanism, stress response, programmed cell death, metabolism, biosynthesis and activation of protein syntheses etc. were involved into PPD mechanism.  Morante et al., 2010  reported that waxy cassava varieties were resistant to PPD but the mechanism is still under investigation. Finally Uarrota and Maraschin 2015 showed that several compounds (high phenolic acids, scopoletin, proteins, carotenoids, and hydrogen peroxide, as well as the increase of the guaiacol peroxidase activity in non-stored cassava roots) could be used as potential biomarkers related to the tolerance of PPD. 
 DISCUSSION This review seeks to explore the relationship between breeding efforts and end-user preferences in order to offer suggestions for future research. The review has focused on several areas being: a) Acceptance criteria for end-users with respect to sensory characteristics of the different types of cassava products b) Physicochemical characteristics (quality traits) of cassava and how these are related to sensory characteristics, and acceptance Genetic drivers for these physicochemical characteristicsc) The past successes of introduced varieties have been in the reduction of losses from pest and disease by the introduction of cassava that is resistant to African Cassava Mosaic Disease  (Thresh et al, 1997)  and this is thought to have saved between $1.2 and $2.3 billion per annum  (1997 values) . More recently, varieties resistant to Cassava Brown Streak Disease have been developed and released but it is too soon to determine the impact (M. Gowda, personal communication). New varieties have increased yields of fresh roots (from 5 to 10 tonnes per ha in the 1950's to between 10-15 tonnes per ha in 2002  (Nweke et al., 2002) ). With a current production in Africa of 157 million tonnes per annum (FAOSTAT 2013), the increase in production with newer high yielding varieties could potentially be equivalent to an additional 30 to 60 million tonnes per year (estimate). However, the success regarding the acceptance of new cassava varieties by end-users has been difficult to measure, because there are few published results on this topic or attempts to measure the impact  (Acheampong, 2015) . Breeders, however, need access to knowledge to understand how improved cassava varieties might be perceived by end-users and how modifying cassava quality trait might affect processing ability, sensory characteristics and consequently consumer acceptance and market demand. The types of cassava products had distinct sensory characteristics and these should direct breeding initiatives. In Brazil, Farmers Participatory Research Techniques have been reported to be effective mechanisms to identify crop constraints and may be useful for application to end user traits  (Pires de Matos et al. 1997) . A recent research study in Zambia looked at farmer preference, utilisation of improved cassava varieties and biochemical composition  (Chiwona-Karltun et al., 2015) . There was a clear relationship between variety use and biochemical composition (e.g. varieties used for local dish 'nshima' had high carbohydrate content). Similar studies are needed to understand how improved cassava varieties can be promoted for different product applications based on biochemical composition that links to quality traits. In our review, non-fermented cassava products (that were directly consumed) were either related to sensory characteristics associated with bland and texture or to the type of processing as in fried products. Non-fermented cassava products that were made into industrial products needed to meet specifications laid down in standards from the private sector. The specifications tended to relate to dry matter content, starch content, cyanide concentration, colour, foreign matter and microbiological levels. For products formed by water submersion, the criteria tended to relate to dry matter content, colour, texture and taste and odour being either related to fermented attributes or bland according to local tastes. Solid stage fermented products tend to be associated with attributes relating to sourness, swelling capacity, particle size and appearance. Genes responsible for some of these traits are being investigated.  Table 4  summarises the relationships between quality traits, possible genes associated and the effect of quality trait improvement on the sensory perception and end-user acceptance. Although some research has been carried out on some of the main quality traits of cassava, there are still many gaps. One of the hurdles for instance is epistasis. Epistasis between the different genes responsible for expressing specific traits is not well known; for instance the correlations between high dry matter content and high cyanogenic content or between low dry matter content and high carotenoid content. It seems that for the latter, the link between dry matter content and carotenoid content could be overcome since high carotenoid and high dry matter varieties have been successfully developed by CIAT  (Ceballos et al. 2013) . Some findings suggested that the link between PPD reduction and carotenoid content (and hence other antioxidants in the root) was not actually proven and that the concentration in scopoleptin seems to play a greater role than the colour or carotenoid content of the root in reducing PPD  (Luna et al. 2014) . Recently, breeders are progressively changing the focus of their research to target specific particular cassava traits  (Liu et al., 2011) . In the future, the progress in genomics and breeding will help understand the make-up of cassava and also how to breed more efficiently and rapidly to obtain desirable characteristics. The progress should help 'tailor' varieties of cassava that will be adapted to specific products and with specific nutritional characteristics. 
 GAPS AND FUTURE RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES This review has explored current published work on cassava and end-user preference. The authors have identified gaps in knowledge which may help direct future breeding programmes and also enhance impact. Suggested gaps are as follows: 1) Can more be learned from past successes in introducing cassava varieties? New knowledge about the success and failures for farmers to adopt may provide new insights that can assist breeding programmes and understand impact which may be related to socioeconomic, gender and market issues. How would this be measured? 2) There is a paucity of knowledge regarding the size of the market for the key cassava products in Africa. The authors have made an estimate based on personal observations only. Research into understanding the market space that cassava products occupy and future trends will be important in determining where the resource investment in cassava breeding will be needed. For example, in Africa there is increasing interest in diversification of cassava from direct food use to starch production, syrups, industrial adhesives, use in beer production etc. In addition, new varieties that can contribute to alleviating vitamin A deficiency have recently been introduced and impact will be enhanced if there is a better understanding of market demand. 3) The plant breeding initiatives will need to respond to new emerging technologies relating to farming, storage, processing (for example grating, pressing, drying etc.) and marketing. 4) A deeper understanding of competing products in the market space that cassava occupies will also assist plant breeders more accurately determine the traits to breed far. For example, cassava will compete with other staple products with increasing urbanisation as people migrate from rural areas. 5) Socioeconomic and gender analyses may be important to ensure that uptake meets the requirements of local communities and that uptake is equitable. Overall little work has been reported on the gender differences in the consumer acceptance rating of cassava products. Market interventions must take into account the difficult and challenging subject of gendered power relations which ultimately constrain women's benefits in markets more generally  (Forsythe et al., 2015) . A thorough gender analysis is required with reference to end user preferences in order to question assumptions of de facto inclusiveness prevalent in development narratives about markets. 6) Intellectual property rights issues may be critical so that communities in Africa can benefit from local knowledge they have.

 CASSAVA TRAITS Figure 3 3 categorises the products according to four types of processes. These have been divided into two main categories: 
 varieties are called 'biofortified' (Figure 4A). Biofortification is the process by which micronutrients of interest are increased without sacrificing important agronomic traits such as yield and resistance to environmental stressors. The aim of biofortification is tackle micronutrient deficiency or also called hidden hungerbecause of the lack of overt clinical signs in people who are deficient. Increase in micronutrients in the crop along with improved agronomic traits can be achieved through conventional breeding, by improving agronomic practices (i.e. fertilisers, water management), or by genetically engineering or modification techniques (De Moura et al., 2015) . Yellow provitamin A cassava varieties were first released inNigeria and in DRC in 2011-12 (Bouis and Welch, 2010) .

Although mountain gorillas are classified as Critically Endangered by IUCN, Grauer's gorillas have been classified as Endangered  [1] . Mountain gorillas have been surveyed regularly since the late 1970s and their small numbers are currently increasing  [2] [3] ; in contrast, there have been few surveys of Grauer's gorilla and only one attempt to measure population numbers across its range  [4] [5] . Those surveys, made in 1994-95, used line transects, complete nest counts and reconnaissance surveys to produce an estimate of 16,900 individuals. The 1994-95 surveys did not identify gorilla populations in the Tayna-Usala region; however, which would have increased the total estimate by 1,000-2,000 individuals  [6] . The Rwandan genocide in 1994 caused hundreds of thousands of refugees to flee to the DRC and this in turn led to the DRC civil war in 1996  [7] , which continued until 2003 with devastating consequences, including an estimated five million people killed, increased insecurity, heightened illegal bushmeat trade and increased deforestation  [8] . In eastern DRC, the civil war resulted in the formation of many armed groups, including those born among local communities protecting their interests from other armed groups (Mai Mai militia), particularly over access to mining sites  [9] . Artisanal mining expanded in North and South Kivu provinces, with most mines controlled by armed militia or soldiers from the national army  [10] . Artisanal miners and militia often operate in remote forests, far from villages, and resort to hunting the local fauna to feed themselves, targeting the larger species that provide more meat  [11] . Despite being protected by law, gorillas are highly prized as bushmeat because of their large size and they are killed relatively easily with guns since they move in groups on the ground  [12]  and can be tracked more easily than other large primates, such as chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Concern over the status of Grauer's gorilla has been mounting as the insecurity and inability to implement the rule of law in eastern DRC continue. Predictions of large declines in numbers have been made with limited data, available from only a few locations  [6] , making it difficult to extrapolate across the Grauer's range. Here we present an assessment of the current status of Grauer's gorilla and show that populations have declined drastically across most of its former range. The 1994-95 surveys estimated that Grauer's gorillas in Kahuzi-Biega National Park (KBNP), including Kasese to the west, formed 86% of the subspecies total population with the highest densities inside the park  [4] , and that gorillas in KBNP numbered 7,670 individuals  [5] . Using two newly-compiled datasets, we compared 1) density estimates of Grauer's gorillas in KBNP and adjacent areas, and 2) encounter rates of gorilla nests from 10 sites across its range: Balala Forest; Itombwe Reserve; KBNP (Tshivanga, Nzovu, Itebero combined with the north of Lulingu, and Kasese sectors); Maiko National Park; two sites in the Reserve des Gorilles de Punia (RGPU; Kasese region); and Usala Forest. We then developed an occupancy model with spatial auto-correlation in a hierarchical Bayesian framework to estimate the occupancy probability of gorillas across their range using data collected by park rangers and local community teams who can access the forest even where security is poor. Species range and numbers of gorillas are estimated using this model by identifying a threshold probability, maximizing model performance in predicting gorilla presence and absence. 
 Methods 
 Data Three types of data were available that recorded gorilla signs with georeferenced locations: 1) transect data from surveys made in the lowland sector of KBNP between 2011 and 2015; 2) data from reconnaissance walks (recces) to survey presence of gorillas between 2011 and 2015, including visits to specific cells to collect occupancy data; 3) data from patrols made by rangers (in parks) and by local community ecoguards (in community reserves) between 2011 and 2015 and which were stored in freely-available SMART software (Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool -www.smartconservationsoftware.org). SMART is a new and improved tool for measuring, evaluating and tracking the effectiveness of wildlife law-enforcement patrols and sitebased conservation activities. Recces involve walking in a specific compass direction, but minimising cutting of vegetation by following animal trails or paths. GPS location data were taken at least every 250 metres along transects and at a maximum of every 30 minutes on recces or patrols. Wherever sightings of gorillas, or gorilla sign (nests, trails or feeding sign) were observed, a GPS location was also recorded. JSH and EAW provided data on nest counts from the 1994 transect surveys of Grauer's gorilla in KBNP. Transect data included perpendicular distance measurements to gorilla nests to enable detection probabilities to be calculated using Distance 6.0  [13] . 
 Data analysis Density estimates of gorilla in Kahuzi-Biega National Park and other sites. Line-transect data were collected by trained field teams walking 3-km transects that were established using the planning design module in Distance 6.0  [13] . Observers walked these lines silently at about 1-km h -1 to ensure that they were able to spot animals and record all sightings of primates, and ape nests and sign. In 1994, surveys were made in the Itebero, Lulingu and Nzovu sectors of KBNP. The same areas were surveyed between 2013 and 2015. We also carried out surveys in the Kasese Sector of the park in the west (in 2015), the Concession Forestière Communautaire des Banisamasi (CFCB) north of the park (in 2011), and the Tayna and Kisimba-Ikobo reserves (in 2013). A total transect length of 320.0 km was walked in 1994 and 277.7 km in the 2011-2015 surveys. We combined perpendicular distance to nest groups from the 1994 surveys with the more recent surveys and used the Multiple Covariate Distance Sampling (MCDS) analysis option in Distance 6.0 with survey period (1994 vs. 2011-2015) as a covariate. This option was used because the number of nest group sightings for the recent surveys was too few (16 nest groups) to estimate a separate detection function. MCDS constrains the shape of the curve to be similar across time periods but allows the scale of detection to vary. Perpendicular distances to nest groups were analysed rather than to individual nests  [14]  to be comparable to the analyses made in 1994. Nest density estimates were converted to densities of weaned gorillas assuming that each constructs one nest per day and average decay rate was 106 days-the method used in the 1994 analyses  [5, 15] . Comparison of encounter rates. Encounter rate data were calculated from transect, recce and SMART datasets from 10 sites (protected areas or sectors within protected areas) where data existed for at least two time periods at the same site. A total distance of 12,730 km was walked at these sites between 1994 and 2015, with 977 km walked in the 1990s, 2,044 km between 2000 and 2010, and 9,709 km between 2011 and 2015. The number of gorilla nests per km walked (encounter rate) was calculated for each dataset for specific survey periods. The most recent encounter rates at a site were compared with the earliest encounter rate from the same site where the same method had been used (i.e. transect datasets were compared and recce datasets were compared, but because encounter rates tend to be higher on transects than on recces we did not compare between them). The percentage of the final encounter rate value to the initial value was calculated and the percentage loss was divided by the number of years between the two estimates to obtain a rate of loss per year. Occupancy probability. Initially we planned to collect targeted occupancy data from 120 randomly-selected 5 x 5 km cells from a grid laid over Grauer's gorilla's known range. This grid size was chosen because it is approximately the size of gorilla home ranges in this region  [12, 16, 17] . Insecurity in the region between 2012 and 2015 prevented teams from surveying more than 40 of these cells. We therefore used the full set of data from SMART, recces and transects, and combined them with data from the 40 cells surveyed in the occupancy analysis to accumulate a dataset of 1,061 sampled cells. Each dataset consisted of point data with GPS coordinates. The points were linked with lines for each patrol/survey to produce tracks of where teams had passed. These were then cut into cell-segments for each 5 x 5 km cell across the landscape to obtain the length of track in each cell. These cell-segments were then further divided and the presence of gorilla or chimp sign recorded for each 1-km unit in each cell. Only track lengths of 1 km were used (shorter sections were excluded). We used spatial replication of these 1-km segments in each 5 x 5 km grid cell for the occupancy analysis  [18] . The number of units ranged from two to 50 per cell. Cells with zero gorilla sign were added in areas where we were certain gorillas were not present (lakes, agricultural land, settlements, and forest well beyond their known historical range). The occupancy analysis was performed using the R-package hSDM  [19] . This package uses a hierarchical Bayesian approach that can incorporate spatial dependency in the analysis. When estimating occupancy of the 5 x 5 km cells across the landscape, two issues needed to be considered: 1) imperfect detection and 2) spatial correlation. When a team visits a cell and walks through it they either detect sign of gorillas or they do not. If they do not, it may be because the gorillas were truly not there (true absence) or because the signs were missed but actually were there (false absence). Occupancy analysis enables an estimate of the detection probability to be made, which is usually less than 1 because some animals are missed in most surveys. A hierarchical or mixture model approach is used to estimate detectability, and Bayesian statistical methods used to estimate the parameters of such complex models. Taking spatial correlation into account is important to determine species range because most species show some form of geographical patchiness that can be explained by ""hidden"" biological (e.g., animals in groups) or environmental (e.g., geographical barriers) variables  [19, 20] . We used covariables to predict from the sampled cells where we could calculate occupancy to estimate occupancy probabilities across the landscape. Thirteen covariables (see  Table A  in S1 File) were used to predict occupancy probability using the hSDM R package  [21] . We used a combination of climate, topographic and human impact variables. Initially we correlated these variables and removed those that had a Pearson correlation coefficient greater than 0.7. Covariables were standardised by subtracting values from the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. We ran the analyses using the hSDM Zero Inflated Binomial (ZIB) model  [22] , which assumes no difference in detectability between replicates. In this case, we were sampling 1-km replicate lines around the same time in each cell so it was unlikely that there would be a major difference in detectability. The hSDM.ZIB() function uses a mixture model that combines a Binomial process for observability and a Bernoulli process for habitat suitability. Effectively it fitted a logistic curve to the covariable layers to predict occupancy across the landscape. We ran the model with and without a spatial correlation analysis. The spatial correlation analysis incorporated an intrinsic Conditional Autoregressive model (iCAR), which assesses the spatial configuration of the eight nearest neighbouring cells to measure the spatial autocorrelation  [20]  (see Model A in S1 File). We ran the hSDM.ZIB and hSDM.ZIB.iCAR models in the following manner: This allowed us to assess the relative importance of each environmental and human impact variable on ape occupancy across the landscape. The effect of a variable was considered significant if zero was outside the 95% confidence interval of the parameter posterior distribution. For the parameter inference in a Bayesian framework, we used non-informative priors with large variance: Normal(mean = 0,variance = 10e 6 ), except for the variance parameter of the spatial random effects, for which we used a weak informative prior: Uniform(min = 0, max = 10). We ran two parallel MCMCs for each parameter and checked the convergence of the chains visually and using the Gelman and Rubin's convergence diagnostic. Estimating Grauer's gorilla numbers. To transform the map of probabilities of presence from the occupancy analysis into a gorilla distribution range we calculated a probability threshold maximizing the True Skill Statistic (TSS;  Fig A in S1 File)    [23] . Using data from nine sites where we had density estimates from line transect surveys in 1994 and 2011-2015, we regressed the encounter rate of individual nests with the density of gorillas and found a significant relationship  (Fig B in S1 File) . Using the regression equation obtained and the values of encounter rate obtained at the 10 sites where we had encounter rate data, we estimated average density of gorillas across their range, weighting by the area of each site. The surface area of the gorilla distribution range was multiplied by the weighted density of Grauer's gorillas to estimate the total population size. Computing lower and upper confidence limits around this number, we need to take into account the uncertainty around density estimates as well as the uncertainty in the gorilla distribution range estimated from the hSDM.ZIB.iCAR model. Both sources of uncertainty were taken into account by combining the 95% quantiles (2.5% and 97.5% values) for both measures (area and density). 
 Results 
 Comparison of density estimates Between 2011 and 2015 we surveyed the areas of KBNP covered in 1994-95 (Itebero and Nzovu sectors) and three other sites: the Kasese Sector, CFCB forest, and the Tayna and Kisimba-Ikobo reserves. When we calculated densities and estimated population numbers, we uncovered dramatic declines in nest and gorilla densities in the same sectors of KBNP  (Table 1) : the Itebero-Lulingu Sector (Zones 1-3  [5] ) and Nzovu Sector (Zone 4  [5] ). Combining the data for both sectors gives an 86.6% reduction in gorilla numbers for the lowland area of this park.  
 Comparison of encounter rates Comparisons of nest encounter rates (i.e. the number of nests counted per km walked on transects) showed major declines (81.7-100%) in six of the 10 sites: Balala Forest, Itombwe Reserve, KBNP (Itebero-Lulingu and Nzovu sectors), Maiko National Park, and RGPU north (  Table 2) . Smaller declines (5-10%) in encounter rates were observed in the Kasese Sector of KBNP, RGPU east and Usala Forest. In only one site, the highland Tshivanga Sector of KBNP, was an increase in encounter rates observed (following a drastic decline between 1994-2000). Half the population at Tshivanga was lost in the 1990s, when insecurity compromised the antipoaching activities of the park's staff, but it has since recovered with improved protection. The steady growth of this population since 2000 is attributed to highly-targeted protection efforts by the protected area authority, the Institut Congolais pour la Conservation de la Nature (ICCN), together with rehabilitation of the gorilla tourism programme. Across the six sites exhibiting a major decline, the average rate of decline was 6.0% per year, with an average total decline of 94.2% over the entire range during the past 20 years (1994-2015). 
 Occupancy Analysis Three significant environmental variables were identified (distance to active deforestation (m); elevation (m), and tree cover (%)) which together explained 17% of the model fit, and the spatial correlation explained a further 39%  (Table 3 ). Grauer's gorilla is, therefore, found in high altitude areas far from areas where people are clearing forest, with a high tree cover; effectively places people tend not to be. Occupancy analysis, incorporating this spatial autocorrelation (using an intrinsic Conditional Autoregressive Model), and using these three significant predictor covariables in a Bayesian framework (see methods) showed that KBNP, RGPU and Usala forest remain critical sites for Grauer's gorilla conservation  (Fig 1) . However, the extent of the KBNP-RGPU region where gorillas are present  (Fig 1)  has decreased in size from previous estimates of 15,870 in 1959  [5, 24]  to 12,770 km 2 in 1994 [5] to 9,005 km 2 today, a 29.5% loss in surface area since 1994 and 43.3% loss since 1959. Other areas of importance for Grauer's populations are parts of the Itombwe Reserve, the Tayna and Kisimba-Ikobo community reserves.  We computed the probability threshold of the occupancy data (0.35), maximizing the TSS to estimate the area where gorillas are likely to occur. The area of habitat where the occupancy probability exceeded the threshold was 19,700 km 2 . A regression of gorilla density on nest encounter rates using data from nine sites was significant (R 2 a dj = 0.96 -see  Fig B  in S1 File) and allowed us to predict gorilla density at the sites for which we had encounter rate data. The mean density of gorillas across their range was 0.193 km -2 , weighted by the area of the site. We then estimated the number of Grauer's gorillas remaining in the wild by multiplying this area by the mean density and produced an estimate of 3,800 individuals. Upper and lower 95% confidence interval maps. We computed the 95% confidence interval of the posterior distribution of the probability of presence for each spatial cell using argument save.p = 1 in the hSDM R package. We used this confidence interval to generate an upper and lower confidence probability map  (Fig 2) . For the three maps of probability, we computed the probability threshold maximizing the TSS and derived the mean and 95% confidence interval for the gorilla distribution range  (Fig 3) . Lower and upper confidence limits around the estimated numbers of gorillas across their range were computed from the uncertainty in the regression of encounter rate against density as well as the uncertainty in the gorilla distribution range resulting from the hSDM.ZIB.iCAR model. Combining both sources of uncertainty, the estimate of Grauer's gorilla numbers is 3,800 (95% CL: 1,280-9,050). 
 Discussion 
 Survey coverage and gorilla densities This survey of Grauer's gorilla is the most extensive ever made for this ape  [4, 6] . More sites were visited than have been previously to obtain quantitative data and more than 12,000 km were walked to obtain the data. Field teams conducted intensive surveys even in regions of insecurity where access was possible, searching for ground nests and other signs of this elusive ape. Insecurity has cost the lives of more than 150 ICCN rangers in eastern DRC in the past 20 years. Collecting data on Grauer's gorillas is therefore fraught with difficulty. WCS has established SMART databases across much of eastern DRC, in both national parks and community reserves. Rangers and ecoguards now have the ability to collect data on illegal activities and record wildlife observations on their smartphones during patrols. We used data collected by local community members and ICCN rangers, entered into SMART, because this enabled data to be collated from across most of Grauer's gorilla's range. SMART data are not collected uniformly across an area, but by analysing occupancy in grid cells and employing the novel approach of incorporating spatial autocorrelation in a Bayesian framework, it is possible to estimate the occupancy probability in a rigorous manner. Quantitative surveys of great apes are time consuming and expensive, involving line transects and ideally the measurement of decay rates of nests in the region being surveyed. Decay rates are often borrowed from other sites because of these costs or lack of time  [15] . The tight regression we obtained between encounter rate of numbers of individual nests along transects and the density of gorillas at a site (R 2 = 0.96) means that encounter rates, which are easier and less costly to obtain, could be used to estimate gorilla density at sites across Grauer's gorilla range in future. Hierarchical Bayesian species distribution model to improve species range estimate. The approach used here to calculate occupancy, incorporating spatial autocorrelation, converting this to a threshold value using the TSS, and weighting average density when calculating gorilla numbers is a novel way of estimating great ape population size, and one that will allow estimates to be made for other apes and elusive species. Of the 13 environmental and human-activity related variables initially tested to explain the distribution of the Grauer's gorilla, we selected only three explanatory variables based on statistical significance and biological coherence: tree cover, altitude and distance to recent deforestation. While the effects of these variables were easy to interpret (gorillas are most likely found in remote access areas at high altitude and under closed canopy forest, far away from recent human disturbance), they explained only 17% of the null model deviance  (Table 3 ). Using only  these variables in the species distribution model, we would have had a rough estimate of the potential suitable habitat for the gorillas, but it would not have been possible to estimate the current species range with precision  [25] . Including spatial random effects through the iCAR process, we were able to explain up to 56% of the null model deviance, increasing the deviance explained by 39 points. The final model had a high TSS value of 0.87 and was thus able to predict accurately both gorilla presence and absence. The resulting distribution map, albeit imperfect and showing some false-presence sites (e.g., Rwenzori National Park), was coherent in comparison with observational data and expert knowledge  [26] . Many species show some form of geographical patchiness  [19, 20] , as we have found for Grauer's gorilla. Including spatial autocorrelation in species distribution models accounts for the effects of ""hidden"" variables that explain patchiness in their distribution  [19] . These hidden variables can be intrinsic biological variables (e.g., social animals living in groups) or extrinsic environmental variables (e.g., unavailable climatic variables such as air humidity, or geographic barriers impeding species dispersion). Software packages commonly used to model species distribution, such as Maxent  [27]  or Biomod [28], do not account explicitly for spatial-autocorrelation. Here, we show the advantage of using a hierarchical Bayesian species distribution model with spatial autocorrelation to estimate a species' range more accurately. This was made possible by the hSDM R package, which provides functions for estimating the parameters of an iCAR process. This approach can be easily extended to other species showing geographical patchiness and for which access to significant explanatory variables is limited (see  [29, 30]  for fish and bird examples, respectively). Another advantage of our hierarchical model compared to the classical approaches cited above is the possibility of accounting for false-absence sites through the estimation of a detection parameter. Finding traces of gorilla presence (direct detection of individuals, or indirect signs of presence such as nests or faeces) in dense tropical forest is not easy. Not accounting for imperfect detection can drastically reduce the performance of species distribution models [31]. To account for imperfect detection, we used a zero-inflated binomial (ZIB) model combining a Binomial distribution for the suitability process and a Bernoulli distribution for the detectability process. We estimated an 11% probability of detecting gorilla presence if the site was suitable. Accounting for imperfect detection, we aimed at increasing the performance of our model to provide more accurate estimates of the species' range and population size. 
 Conservation status of Grauer's gorilla Updating the conservation status of Grauer's gorilla to Critically Endangered. It was suspected that a large decline in Grauer's gorilla numbers was likely because of the extensive insecurity and evidence of poaching of apes by armed militias and rebel groups  [1, 32] . Our results show there has been a mean reduction of 87% in gorilla density in the lowland area of KBNP, an average decline of 94% in nest encounter rates at six of 10 sites, and overall a 77% decline in the estimated total number of individuals across its range. It is likely that our model tended to overestimate the area (give false presences rather than false absences  [21] ), therefore the 77% decline is a minimum estimate. In order for a taxon to be listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List it must decline by more than 80% over three generations  [33] . Gorillas can live for 30-40 years, but the average generation time of Grauer's gorillas is 20 years  [1] . Our results show at least a 77% decline in Grauer's gorilla in just one generation, which qualifies the taxon as Critically Endangered (CR A4bcd). Mountain gorillas are already listed as Critically Endangered [34] and a similar listing for Grauer's gorilla will classify the eastern gorilla species as Critically Endangered, with a population size of fewer than 5,000 individuals. This uplisting will categorise all gorilla taxa as Critically Endangered. 
 Conservation actions for protecting Grauer's gorilla populations. Halting and even reversing the decline of Grauer's gorilla will take considerable effort and will require more funding than is currently available. Artisanal mining must be regulated, and the various rebel groups controlling the mines disarmed. To accomplish this, it will be necessary to halt mining in protected areas, because miners subsist on bushmeat and hunt gorillas around their camps  [11] . We urge the Government of DRC to actively seek to control this part of the country for the benefit of both humans and gorillas. Significant efforts must be made for the government to regain control of this region of DRC. In particular, this should include professionalising the DRC military and increasing their pay, so that they are better motivated to collaborate with ICCN and partners to protect the wildlife of this region. Grauer's gorilla is endemic to DRC and a symbol of the Albertine Rift, one of the richest areas on the planet for biodiversity. Unless significantly greater investment is made to conserve them, we are likely to lose Grauer's gorilla from many sites across its range in the next five years.

 • The concept of a corridor in West Africa The concept of a corridor has many interpretations. As both a line of communicat ion and a project territory. the functions. goals and stakeholders concerned differ from one corridor to another. With t heir concentrat ion of t ransportation routes connecting remote places. corridors also sometimes enable movement within the areas they go through. ln West Africa. t he ""Sahel-coastal"" corridors are t he legacy of colonial export infrastructure. reclassified after the countries gained independence as policies to tackle rural isolation. lnitially t he port-railway combinations orchestrated the movement of agricultural and mining products from t he hinterlands and. in return, supplied t hese areas with consumer goods. Infrast ructure policies have been conducted in these corridors for decades, with regional integration as a common goal for t he different cooperation institutions. However. the effects of communication corridors do not necessarily result in the development of these territories. • A corridor outside the WAEMU Because of the route it takes and t he formai tracte that gravitates around it. the Ouagadougou-Accra corridor is not really the legacy of colonial infrastructure. The Kumasi -Accra road was indeed built for gold and cocoa in the early days of the Brit ish Gold Coast. but the Kumasi-Ouagadougou section. straddling Burkina Faso and Ghana, corresponds to other processes. Tamale was only linked to Kumasi by Road in 1920. for administrative purposes and the recruitment of workers for the south of present-day Ghana. The stretch linking Ouagadougou to Tamale will be consolidated over the next decade. ln terms of the economy and transport. the successive colo nial and national policies implemented until the m id-1990s left the landlocked states dependent on the outside, generally through a single sector and a single maritime outlet. These states then opted for competition between the marit ime outlet points which. combined with the lvorian crisis. enabled the Ghanaian corridor to set itself apart from its neighbours, linked to Abidjan. . which includes the WAEMU member countries. But the removal of barriers to intra-regional trade is still limited: while ECOWAS external t rade benefits from a common tariff. internai movements of goods remain problematic. 
 • Enhancing complementarities in food production The main strength of this corridor is its diversity: a Sahel-coastal climatic gradient combined with a political. linguistic and monetary boundary. This diversity is a source of spatial complementarities illustrated by the food distribution channels for yams. maize and cowpeas. Yams. which are relatively ra re in Burkina Faso. are grown in the forest-savannah transit ion zone, f rom the border to the south of Lake Volt a. whereas cowpeas are mostly produced in the north. in the Sahel zone. and to a lesser extent in Ghana. Maize is grown along the whole length of the corridor, with high concentrations in the southern parts of both countries. Flows of yams go in two directions: huge demand from southern Ghanaian cit ies and massive exports towards the Sahel. Movements of cowpeas are mostly towards urban parts of Ghana, after concentration in the major markets of Burkina Faso. Grown in most parts of the corridor. maize follows more complex patterns: the southern half of Ghana has two rainy seasons. but the hum id t ropical climate is an obstacle to drying and conservation. Flows therefore have interannual variations depending o n harvests. are reversed according to t he climate and are even reconfigured depending on prices. lt is not unusual for grain from Ghana to be dried in the Burkinabe Sahel zone before returning to its country of origin. As a priority. these flows of food crops are intended for urban market s. but they also meet growing. more diversified demand from the emerging • A cross-border perspective for spatial inclusion The centre of gravity of cross-border tracte -whether formai or informai -has shifted in favour of connections between Ghana and Burkina Faso. rather than the tradit ional lvorian outlet inherited from colonial tracte flows and the Bobo-Dioulasso zone. ln an opportunistic manner. this tracte has intensified and market specialisation has restructured the economic area of the corridor. but it has not become more formalised as a result. Although free trade is hampered by numerous illegal levies, strategies to avoid these many obstacles and border crossing practices range from completely legal to completely illegal. As a result. this tracte network linking rural agricultural basins. intermediate towns. border markets and urban consumption hubs mobilises different types of stakeholders on different levels. from agriculture to the retail trade. via transport. logistics and finance. Inclusive rural development projects have emerged in the cross-border areas this corridor goes through. These include the Northern Rural Growth Programme and the Savannah Accelerated Development Authority in Ghana. and the Bagré Growth Pole in Burkina Faso. Over and above the interconnection of the areas it covers. the Ouagadougou-Accra corridor provides a type ofhybrid integration. which is neither institutionalised nor completely info rmai.

African rainy seasons experience recurrent dry spells, as described in many climate-related studies  (Modarres, 2010; Barron, 2004; Barron et al., 2003; Sivakumar, 1992) . These dry spells are important factors in crop failures, depending on when they occur during the cropping season, and their duration and frequency  (Barron et al., 2003) . This variability has a direct impact on the primary production, diets and monetary incomes of rural families and food supply  (Failler, 2014; Badolo and Kinda, 2014) . Farmers have developed strategies to counter this rainfall variability. Soil and Water Conservation (SWC) techniques such as zaï, half-moons and stone bunds help concentrate water and fertilizer around crops' roots (for more details, see  Zougmoré et al., 2014)  These techniques are rendered ineffective when dry spells, sometimes exceeding two weeks, are too long  (Roose, 1993; Sultan et al., 2013) . Furthermore, some SWC techniques have been found to be barely cost effective for individual farmers, as grain yield increases do not necessarily cover labour inputs and construction costs. For example, it has been shown that in central Burkina Faso, yield increases do not cover the cost of constructing stone bunds in the community because of the large amount of labour required to collect and transport the stones from their original locations to the fields  (Barry et al., 2008) . The construction of stone bunds was found to be profitable when the investment costs were reduced by providing free transportation of stones. With the projected increase in the occurrence of extreme weather events, there should be a focus on techniques that increase production while reducing the impact of rainfall variability. Supplemental irrigation from farm ponds has long been identified as a production technique that should reduce such uncertainties and ensure better food security. Supplemental irrigation is implemented during dry spells in the rainy season to prevent crops from suffering excessive water stress.  Sané et al. (2008)  described the characteristics of such dry spells. In Burkina Faso, the implementation of supplemental irrigation depends on farm size, available water resources, and technical and financial considerations  (Narayan et al., 2008; CNID-B, 2009 ). Many authors have shown supplemental irrigation's potential to minimise risks and increase crop yields in sub-Saharan Africa.  Dugué (1986)  tested supplemental irrigation from small farm ponds in northern Burkina Faso and assessed how it could secure production, especially in years with poor rainfall.  Fox et al. (2005)  have shown that the use of farm ponds and supplemental irrigation can be cost-effective in rain-fed agriculture in Kenya, Tanzania and Burkina Faso. In 2005, the National Agricultural Research Institute (INERA) in Burkina Faso tested supplemental irrigation on sorghum production in Saria under a Sudanese climate (average annual rainfall of 750 mm) and in Sabouna under a Sahelian climate (average annual rainfall of 400 mm). Compared to hand tillage (with hoes), the trial showed that supplemental irrigation has more of an effect on grain yields in the Sahel while tied ridges were more efficient under the Sudanese climate  (Somé and Ouattara, 2005) . The variability (long dry spells) of current rainfall in the Sahel does not allow SWC techniques to be more efficient than supplemental irrigation. However, the authors found that deep ploughing with animal power was an important element that allowed yield gains with supplemental irrigation. Also, the Burkinabe National Committee on Irrigation and Drainage  (CNID-B, 2009; Coulibaly et al., 2011)  has conducted supplemental irrigation tests in the Sourou Valley on 200 ha of maize over a period of three years  (2008) (2009) (2010) . Yields were above 4 tonnes per hectare and increased by between 230% and 300%, providing a significant return on investment. In Burkina Faso, the National Programme on Climate Change Adaptation Strategies (PANA) has incorporated supplemental irrigation in its priority project. Drawing on the experience of a pilot project, Burkina Faso's Ministry of Agriculture launched a 'maize garden' development project mainly in the Sahelian and Sudano-Sahelian agro-climatic zones in 2012. Several thousand farmers were given subsidies of US$ 163 to dig farm ponds of 300m 3 . Farmers dug a total of 3000 farm ponds and, though the impact of the project still has to be evaluated, the Burkina Faso government has initiated another pilot project to promote supplemental irrigation. This project seeks to add thousands of new small ponds collecting runoff water to secure around 2500 ha throughout the country. Most of the studies reviewed were limited to measurements of yields and agronomic impact but did not quantify the economic impact of supplemental irrigation at the farm scale. Supplemental irrigation has been tested in northern Burkina Faso, but not in the more humid southwest. The southwest region is the most favourable for agricultural production in the country and is increasingly marked by strong spatial and temporal rainfall variability, thereby affecting production choices and farmers' incomes. These rainfall disruptions are becoming recurrent, causing a high risk of food insecurity. The purpose of this study is to assess the economic impact of building farm ponds for supplemental irrigation in southwest Burkina Faso. Using a bio-economic model, we compared a baseline scenario to a scenario with supplemental irrigation in which farmers in the catchment dig farm ponds to irrigate their crops during long dry spells in the rainy season. We quantified the impact of the technology on catchment incomes. After an in-depth description of the study area, we present the model built to test the technology (Section 2) and discuss the results (Section 3). 
 Method 
 The study area This study was conducted in the village of Pontièba located in the municipality of Dano in southwest Burkina Faso  (Fig. 1) . The average annual rainfall is 850 mm and the rainy season extends from May to October. It is followed by a dry and cold season from November to January and then a dry and hot season from February to May. The length of the growing period is quite variable, ranging from 70 to 100 days. The number of dry days within the growing season has increased significantly, indicating a change in rainfall distribution. The farming system in the village of Pontièba is typical of the Dano catchment area. The main rainfed crops include maize, sorghum, millet, cotton and, to a lesser extent, cowpea, groundnut and sesame. Sorghum, cotton and maize are grown in the best soils; millet and sorghum are grown on shallower soils and maize in home gardens. Cowpea is usually grown in combination with a cereal. Rice is grown in flooded lowlands during the rainy season. In lowlands with a low flood risk one can also find maize. In irrigated areas, farmers grow rice during the rainy season and vegetables during the dry season, but not necessarily on the same plots. Hand tillage (with traditional hoes) is commonly used for soil preparation and weeding. Only 20% of households in the catchment area use animal traction. Sowing and harvesting are manual. The traditional SWC techniques are not common in the catchment and fallowing soils is becoming rare. In the mid-1990s the average fallow period was about six years, but this has dropped to three years today  (DPASA, Ioba, 2013) . The use of organic fertilizers depends on the quantities of manure available and usage is still very low because the region is not livestock-oriented. Inorganic fertilizer use is low because of the difficulties obtaining credit from banks. Fertilizers are mainly applied to cotton, as the cotton company distributes inputs on credit (fertilizers, seed and pesticides), with the cost of these inputs deducted from the revenues generated after harvest. 
 Sampling and data collection Data about the Pontièba farms in the catchment come from several sources. A survey of a sample of 100 households randomly selected in the village of Pontièba by  Yili (2006)  was conducted in two phases in order to describe the farmers' activities and constraints, and generate data that can help aggregate and parameterise the catchment model. In the first phase, the author identified the characteristics of the households in the area (family size, labour, consumption expenditures, capital, etc.). The catchment is composed of about 300 households with an average of 6 people per household. Cereals such as sorghum, maize and millet are the most consumed. Grain demand per individual per year is estimated at 200 kg according to the standards of the Ministry of Agriculture. In the second phase, the survey focused on land use with plot identification using a Global Positioning System (GPS). Yields, prices and climate data (long-term records: 1981-2013) available for Dano and the surrounding provinces from the Ministry of Agriculture and the Burkina Meteorological Department served to estimate average crop yields and prices. Finally, we held two focus group discussions (FGDs), the first with selected farmers and the second with local agricultural technicians to cross-check the data on yields and prices and discuss some aspects of the cropping patterns and the model. The irrigated area of Pontièba, from the common reservoir, covers about 25 ha or about 2% of the surface area of the catchment (about 13 km 2 ). The reservoir located upstream has a capacity of 300,000 m 3 . When it is full, it allows rice and two successive crops to be irrigated: usually, rice during the rainy season, and then maize or vegetables during the dry season. Dry season production is not always possible because the size of the catchment area means that the reservoir is not completely filled every year. Therefore, the irrigated area varies between 17 and 25 ha, depending on the water available in the reservoir after the rainy season. 
 Formulation of the model The model used in this study is a bio-economic optimisation model that seeks to represent the interactions between a stock of natural capital and the economic activity supported by it  (Pacini et al., 2004) . In our case the natural stock is the stock of water in the reservoir. Bioeconomic models help describe the combination of activities that maximise income and as such are more likely to be implemented by farmers. They are ex-ante assessment tools  (Torkamani, 2005; Pacini et al., 2004; Hazell and Norton, 1986 ) that help test some key innovations, in our case supplemental irrigation. We have chosen not to represent animal breeding in the model because the region is not livestock-oriented. Given the relative isolation of the area, we have also chosen not to include off-farm activities. The land uses in the model are maize, sorghum, millet, cotton, rice, tomatoes and fallow. For maize, the model has distinguished between extensive maize referred to as 'traditional' without SWC techniques nor fertilizer and fertilized maize under supplemental irrigation. The model distinguishes between good land with deep soil used for rainfed crops, marginal land with more shallow soils used for rainfed crops, irrigated land in the rainy season, irrigated land in the dry and cold season, and irrigated land in the dry and hot season. In addition, there are two types of lowland: slightly flooded lowland which is more favourable for maize and regularly flooded lowland which is more favourable for rice or sorghum. The cropping season has been divided into six periods to better reflect labour-related constraints: the planting of rain-fed crops, the harvesting of rain-fed crops, the planting of irrigated crops in the dry and cold season, the harvesting of irrigated crops in the dry and cold season, the planting of irrigated crops in the dry and hot season and, finally, the harvesting of irrigated crops in the dry and hot season. The model also distinguishes between three types of rainy seasons: a dry season, a normal season and a wet season. We defined the distributions of these types of seasons by combining two types of approaches: that taken by the Burkina Faso Meteorological Services Department and the approach taken by farmers. The first classifies seasons according to whether or not they are above or below normal. It classifies any season receiving b 90% of the long-term mean (over 30 years, 1981-2010) as a dry or poor season. Seasons ranging from 90% of the long-term mean to 110% are classified as normal. Seasons ranging from 111% of the long-term mean to 150% are classified as wet or good seasons. Finally, seasons with N150% of the long-term mean rainfall are classified as very wet or very good seasons. This classification is a simplification and does not take into account dry spells within the rainy season. Consequently, in order to verify farmers' assertions, the study looked at dry spells within the rainy season that can negatively impact crop yields. Each type of rainy season is associated with a probability of occurrence referred to as proba (h). In the baseline scenario there is no forecast and the model is considered myopic. We assign identical probabilities (33%) for the distribution of each of the three types of rainy seasons (wet, normal and dry), which is the approach used by the African Centre of Meteorological Applications to Development (ACMAD) to present seasonal forecasts in West Africa. For each type of rainy season, the model associates yields and prices. Yields are estimated according to a Cobb-Douglass production function (Tables 1, 2 and 3). The results on crop yields for each type of rainy season from the Cobb-Douglas production function are used to derive technical coefficients to parameterize the mathematical programming model. During the survey and focus groups discussions, farmers were asked the following questions: Among the agricultural seasons in the past 10 years, which was the best (in term of good yields)? Which was the worst? What are crop yields in good and bad seasons? How were the prices after a good or a bad season? From this information, we cross checked with statistics data from the Ministry of Agriculture and were able to construct confidence intervals for yields and prices for each crop. Considering prices to follow a law of uniform probability, we estimated the random coefficients. Subsequently, the real prices were obtained by multiplying the average by the estimated random coefficients. The prices of food crops vary, usually in the opposite direction of yields. Thus, a dry rainy season is associated with low yields and high prices and the opposite is true for a wet rainy season. The exception is cotton, for which prices are set. The model includes several constraints: land, water, labour, capital and cereal consumption. We added a water constraint related to the irrigated scheme. For supplemental irrigation, we assume that small ponds have been built. Following the government initiative, we assumed that these ponds have an average capacity of 300 m 3 . We added the labour requirement to dig a 300 m 3 farm pond. Farm ponds are dug during the dry season when labour is abundant and the model takes into account the cost of digging a farm pond. The characteristics of the soil in the catchment allow the model to consider a self-sealing option  (Fox et al., 2005) . The farm ponds are built without waterproofing in clayish soils where filtration is limited. Farm ponds are filled by direct runoff. The small 300 m 3 pond is usually filled by a few rainfall events. In the Sudanian zone, the runoff coefficients range from 10% to 25% depending on surface features  (Bagayoko, 2006; Kasei, 2009; Ibrahim et al., 2015) . Thus, with a mean rainfall intensity of 14 mm/day and from an impluvium of one to two hectares, the ponds are supplied with water from the first large rainfalls. Since the ponds contain water from the first cropping stage onwards, farmers can practice supplemental irrigation of maize from the beginning of the rainy season. A bucket-based splashing irrigation technique (hand irrigation) is used in the model. We selected only maize in the model because it is a well-marketed food crop in the sub-region. We added a cereal consumption constraint because farmers consume much of their produced grain. We also added a risk constraint because of the tendency of farmers to be risk averse. To ease understanding of the model's equations, vectors are written in lower case letters, and variables are in capitals. The land constraint is represented as follows: ∑ c ∑ s X c; s ð Þ≤land s ð Þ ð1Þ The land parameter ""land(s)"" distinguishes the surface areas of the various types of land, with ""s"" being the type of land. The cultivated land variable is represented by ""X(c, s)"". The total cultivated area must be less than or equal to the surface area available throughout the catchment area per type of land. The cropping season was divided into six periods to identify work peaks in the agricultural calendar. Cropping activities require labour which varies in some periods. Several farming system studies in Burkina Faso have attempted to calculate labour requirements for typical farms using the number of active workers in the household and the number of available working days  (Broekhuyse, 1983; Prudencio, 1996; Dugué, 1987; Matlon and Fafchamps, 1988; INERA, 1994) . Based on these studies, some authors consider that household members over the age of 15 provide almost the entire workforce  (Roth, 1986; Maatman et al., 1996) . People b 15 years of age are not considered active although they contribute to some farm activities. Roth and Maatman observed that an active man works 7 h a day while a woman works 6 h a day. In our study, the work force is adult-equivalent and men and women achieve the same work with the same efficiency. The Eq. (2) expresses the labour constraint at the catchment level and takes into account the fact that labour can be hired. The total labour requirement  (Table 4 ) takes into account the labour requirement for each crop for each of the six agricultural periods ""lrc (c, p)"", the number of available working days ""awd"" per person, the number of people in the catchment area ""pop"", the proportion of the working population ""wp"" and the labour to be hired for each period ""LH (p)"": ∑ c ∑ s X c; s ð ÞÂlrc c; p ð Þ≤awd Â pop Â wp þ LH p ð Þ ð2Þ The parameter ""cap(c, s)"" represents the capital requirement per hectare per crop and per soil type for the purchase of seeds and other inputs. The parameters ""cseed(c, s)"" and ""cinp(c, s)"" represent the cost of  Table 1  Expected sign of the Cobb Douglas (Solow growth) model variables. The theoretical specification of the model is as follow:     LnYC i;t ¼ α 0i;t þ α 1 LANDC i;t þ α 2 LABOURC i;t þ α 3 NPKC i;t þ α 4 UREC i;t þ α 5 PPC þα 6 PLC i;t þ α 7 OMC i;t þ α 8 dumyHR þ α 9 dumyLR þ e i;t þ μ i;t where ""tcinp(c, s)"" is a parameter indicating the total cost of all inputs. The model offers the possibility of using seasonal credit ""CRED"", and ""cap"" is a parameter indicating the farm capital available at the beginning of the agricultural season: ∑ c ∑ s X c; s ð ÞÂ tcinp c; s ð Þ≤cap þ CRED ð4Þ The credit for input is related to the cotton surface area ""cot"" and corresponds to the input needed for a standard area of cotton: ∑ c ∑ s X cot; s ð ÞÂcap cot; s ð Þ≥CRED ð5Þ The cereal consumption constraint specifies that each household has to cover its cereal needs. This is the product of the annual need for grain per person ""cons"" multiplied by the population of the catchment ""pop"". The variable ""SELF(c)"" is the optimal amount of selfconsumed cereals. The variable ""BC(c)"" is the optimal amount of grain possibly bought to meet the needs of the households and ""fp(c)"" is a food preference coefficient for each type of cereal. It is assumed that farmers display an optimisation behaviour that determines their consumption decisions based on their economic environment (changes in product prices and incomes). Therefore, the food constraint is written as follows: ∑ c SELF c ð Þ þ BC c ð Þ ð Þ Â fp c ð Þ≥cons Â pop ð6Þ To take into account the water constraint in the irrigated area, we incorporated the parameters ""wat (h, s)"" which indicates the amount of water available in the reservoir and ""watn(c, h, s)"" which indicates the need for water in cubic metres per hectare per crop  (Table 4 ). The various constraints related to the construction of farm ponds ""BAS(s)"" and water retention facilities are also introduced. The following equations summarise the water constraints for the two types of irrigation that is from the reservoir and from farm ponds: The water requirement by hectare of crops ""watn(c, h, s)"" has to be met by the amount of water available in the reservoir ""wat (h, s)"", or ""BAS(s)"" (for supplemented irrigated and fertilized maize). The water available from the dam at the beginning of the optimisation period ""wat (h, s)"" can be transferred from one season to the other ""O (h, s)"". Farm ponds created by the model are filled with water runoff, ""ROFF(s)"". Eq.

(9) assumes that the farm ponds are filled many times ""fill"" during the rainy season. 
 BAS s ð Þ Â fill ¼ ROFF s ð Þ ð9Þ Finally, the risk-related constraint states that the income of an adverse year should not be less than a minimum income ""MINC (h)"". The limited-risk models are intended to impose additional constraints on the model which state that the likelihood of occurrence of all other model requirements should be greater than a given threshold  (Diarra et al., 2013) . INC h ð Þ≥MINC h ð Þ ð10Þ The net cash income of the catchment to be maximised is calculated as follows: the quantities of products sold per crop ""c"" are added, ""SELL(c, h)"" multiplied by the unit sale price ""sp(c, h)"" of each crop, and minus the total cost of inputs ""tcinp (c, s)"" per unit of land cultivated multiplied by the crop area ""X(c, s)"", minus cereal purchases ""cp(c, h)"" for consumption multiplied by their purchase price ""cpp(c,h)"", minus financial costs ""rate"" related to seasonal credits multiplied by the amount of credit taken out ""cred"", minus taxes ""tax"" per unit of irrigated area ""land(irr)"", minus the amount of labour to be hired ""LH (p)"" multiplied by the price of agricultural labour ""cl"", minus the cost required to dig farm ponds ""costfp(p)"". ∑ c SELL c ð Þ Â sp c ð Þ− ∑ c;s X c; s ð ÞÂtcinp c ð Þ − ∑ c CP c; h ð ÞÂcpp c; h ð Þ− rate Â CRED ½ − tax Â land irr ð Þ ½ − ∑ p cl Â LH p ð Þ− ∑ p costfp p ð Þ ¼ INC h ð Þ ð11Þ To ascertain that the model does indeed replicate land allocation to crops, calibration and validation processes are required. The calibration consists of adjusting some model parameters (and/or coefficients), and ensuring its internal logic and consistency in order to reproduce farmers' actual observed situations  (Boussard, 1987) . This is a way to find the best parameters (and/or coefficients) that strengthen the model's capacity to reproduce reality  (Santillana and Serrano, 2005) . We used a manual calibration process which accepts a residual deviation of the model's results. The variable ""MINC"" is used to calibrate the model by adjusting it exogenously until the model approximately reflects the allocation of land to crops in the study area. However, while calibration is necessary, it is not sufficient to assess a model, and so the model also needs to be validated.  Ignizio (1982)  identifies four criteria to validate models: logical consistency in its construction, the reliability of the data on which the model is based, the consistency of the model for simple simulations and its ability to reproduce current trends. The observed cropped areas were used as data to validate the model. We compared the simulated land allocation to the various crops to the actual observed allocation  (Table 5 ). The difference is small enough to indicate that the model mimics farmers' behaviour quite well. 
 Scenarios tested The proposed scenarios were designed to test the impact of supplemental irrigation. The first scenario reflects the baseline situation where farmers have no farm ponds. In the second scenario, farmers can dig farm ponds for use during the rainy season. We assume that farmers can build farm ponds in clayish soils, in other words soils which do not need waterproofing with cement coatings or tarpaulins. We also assume that water will be lifted by hand and that irrigation is done with watering cans. For a given scenario, the model calculates the crop allocation and the whole catchment revenue associated with each type of rainy season multiplied by its respective coefficient. 
 Results and discussion 
 Baseline scenario The baseline simulation estimates land allocation between the various crops, agricultural production, several cropping patterns, techniques, consumption, labour, capital allocation between activities and net cash income for the whole catchment. 
 Land allocation to crops Land allocation without the ponds is similar to farmers' practices in the catchment. Millet and sorghum occupy most of the marginal land where soils are shallow  (Fig. 2) . Extensive rain-fed maize and cotton are grown on the deeper soils. Intensive rain-fed maize and rice are planted in the slightly flooded lowland and the regularly and highly flooded lowland respectively. During the dry season, the model adopts, as indeed farmers do, irrigated rice and tomatoes. Around 2% of the land is left fallow because labour is a constraint. However, with population growth all arable land will soon be cropped. Irrigated plots are allocated to rice production during the rainy season and tomato production during the dry and cold season and the dry and hot season. Millet occupies 20% of the available land, sorghum 36%, extensive rain-fed maize 21%, intensive rainfed maize 8%, cotton 4%, rice 5%, and tomatoes 4%. 
 Catchment income The optimal baseline cash net income in normal years is US$ 347,005 for the whole catchment area  (Fig. 3) . During dry years, the catchment cash net income (US$ 265,680) is 23% less than for a normal year due to lower yields. The consequences of dry years are lower crop yields and higher prices. Crop yields tend to fall in proportions greater than price gains (especially for maize and rice). This increase in price does not compensate for lower yields because farmers have little to sell during dry years and have to buy more food at higher prices. On average, in dry years, millet, sorghum, maize and rice yields can drop by 24%, 43%, 60% and 29% respectively  (DPASA, Ioba, 2013 ). In the model, product prices are exogenous but linked to yields. Millet and sorghum prices can rise by 40% and 45%, while maize and rice prices can rise by 42% and 13%. Moreover, in the model, because farmers have to meet household cereal needs, they sell only the surplus, especially after a dry rainy season when they consume their own millet and maize. After a wet season, the catchment income (US$ 395,136) is 14% higher than a normal year when yields are higher but prices are lower. The irrigated area is fully used and a small fraction of the so-called marginal land is not cultivated because village labour is not sufficient to crop the whole area. The marginal value of 1 ha of good land is about US$ 61. The marginal value of irrigated land in the rainy season, irrigated land in the dry and cold season, irrigated land in the dry and  hot season, slightly flooded lowland, and regularly and highly flooded lowland is US$ 1324, US$ 3935, US$ 3605, US$ 269 and US$ 382 respectively. This means, for example, that an additional hectare of irrigated land used in the dry and cold season would increase the catchment income by US$ 3935. Labour is a limiting factor during planting periods and, to a lesser extent, at harvest. Although the model allows labour to be hired, the constraints on capital limit the hiring of workers. It also means that farmers in the catchment area could benefit from hiring external labour during the planting season, provided its cost is lower than the marginal value, which is about US$ 3. During the dry season, labour is not a constraint because only the small irrigated section (4%) of the area is cultivated. The available cash and credit are fully utilised by farms. The model adopts the planting of cotton in order to gain access to credit and inputs. The cotton company provides credit to finance cotton production but not for the other crops. Water is also a limiting factor because the actual reservoir is small and all the water is used. The marginal value is US$ 0.10, meaning that one cubic metre of water would increase the overall income by this amount. This is very little. Risk is also a limiting factor because farmers cannot afford to have too low an income after a dry season. To reduce risk they still grow millet to avoid the impact of droughts, thus pulling down the average income. 
 The supplemental irrigation scenario 
 Land allocation to crops The model adopts 192 farm ponds of 300 m 3 each to irrigate 16 ha of fertilized maize during dry spells in the rainy season. Farm ponds occupy about 3 ha of good land, which is about 17% of the land under supplemental irrigation. Introducing farm ponds for supplemental irrigation during the rainy season will change the allocation of crops slightly  (Fig. 4)  compared to the baseline scenario. Fertilized maize under supplemental irrigation appears on good land with deeper soils (about 2% of the total cropped area). On marginal soils, the model reduces the surface area of millet from 20% to 18% and that of sorghum from 36% to 18%. Fallow land increases significantly, from 26 to 265 ha which is an increase of 919%  (Table 6 ). On slightly flooded lowland, the model proposes extensive rain-fed maize, accounting for 7% of the total cropped area, at the expense of intensive rain-fed maize. On good land, extensive rain-fed maize decreases from 21% to 16%, while the acreage allocated to cotton increases from 4% to 7%. The results show that labour is increasingly allocated to supplemental irrigation and more profitable crops. Indeed, cotton and supplemental irrigated and fertilized maize cultivation is more labour-intensive but more profitable than extensive rain-fed maize, millet or sorghum. The surface area allocated to irrigated rice and tomatoes remains almost unchanged.   
 Catchment income Gains are higher during dry years with a net catchment income increase of 5% over the baseline situation. This is an increase of US$ 14,159 compared to the catchment income in the baseline scenario  (Fig. 5) . In wet and normal years, gains of the ponds are negligible. With supplemental irrigation, fertilized maize yield gains are higher during drier years than they are in normal or wet years. The profitability of irrigated and fertilized maize under supplemental irrigation helps offset the loss of land to the pond and the reduction in amount of land devoted to rain-fed crops. Labour is likely to be a limiting factor because digging farm ponds is time consuming. Given the high demand for labour during the field preparation for rain-fed cropping and at harvest time, the model chooses to build the farm ponds during the dry season when the labour opportunity cost is lower. During the dry season, only 4% of the total farmland is under cultivation and labour is still abundant. Capital remains a limiting factor. This finding is corroborated by  Kumar and Dam (2008) , who reports that capital is likely to be one of the main constraints in the water harvesting systems needed for supplemental irrigation. 
 Conclusion This study evaluated the relative advantage of farm ponds and supplemental irrigation as an adaptation strategy to rainfall variability compared to existing practices in a small catchment in south-western Burkina Faso. A bio-economic model based on mathematical programming was used to mimic the local economy under various scenarios. The model takes into account the complexity of farmers' decisions in a severe agro-climatic environment. The baseline simulation produces a crop allocation similar to the one practiced by farmers in the catchment on the different types of soils in the catchment. If given the possibility, the model adopts 192 farm ponds of 300 m 3 to irrigate 16 ha of intensive maize during dry spells in the rainy season, which means that supplemental irrigation is profitable. However, overall gains remain modest. They are higher during dry years when incomes increase by 5%. Supplemental irrigation makes intensive maize production possible over a small area but would reduce the area of rain-fed crops, such as maize, millet and sorghum, and more land would be left fallow. The increase in intensive maize would also trigger the expansion of cotton because cotton production increases access to credit and inputs. The model proposes the building of more ponds but constraints on labour, water and capital restrict its expansion beyond the 16 ha. Supplemental irrigation secures only part of production. It could become an important technology for agriculture in semi-arid regions such as Burkina Faso, but we also need to consider the capital constraints of Burkinabe farmers.

Hotspots for avian influenza virus (AIV) in wild birds are largely unstudied and poorly understood. A striking feature is the existence of a unique but consistent AIV hotspot in shorebirds (Charadriiformes) associated with a single species at a specific location and time (ruddy turnstone Arenaria interpres at Delaware Bay, USA, in May). This unique case, though a valuable reference, limits our capacity to explore and understand the general properties of AIV hotspots in shorebirds. Unfortunately, relatively few shorebirds have been sampled outside Delaware Bay and they belong to only a few shorebird families; there also has been a lack of consistent oropharyngeal sampling as a complement to cloacal sampling. In this study we looked for AIV hotspots associated with other shorebird species and/or with some of the larger congregation sites of shorebirds in the old world. We assembled and analysed a regionally extensive dataset of AIV prevalence from 69 shorebird species sampled in 25 countries across Africa and Western Eurasia. Despite this diverse and extensive coverage we did not detect any new shorebird AIV hotspots. Neither large shorebird congregation sites nor the ruddy turnstone were consistently associated with AIV hotspots. We did, however, find a low but widespread circulation of AIV in shorebirds that contrast with the absence of AIV previously reported in shorebirds in Europe. A very high AIV antibody prevalence coupled to a low infection rate was found in both first-year and adult birds of two migratory sandpiper species, suggesting the potential existence of an AIV hotspot along their migratory flyway that is yet to be discovered.

Particular seasons, environments, or species associations can generate disease ''hotspots'' in which pathogen prevalence is consistently higher than elsewhere. These hotpots play a major role in the dynamics of infectious diseases: for instance, seasonal peaks in infection rate produce a rapid increase in the level of the population immunity, affecting the long-term maintenance of a pathogen in the host population; elevated pathogen prevalence may facilitate reassortment between hetero-subtypic pathogens; and hotspots may constitute a source of pathogen spillovers to less susceptible or less exposed species, environments or geographical areas that are connected to the hotspot by host movements. Identifying the occurrence of hotspots is therefore of particular importance for the control and prevention of infectious diseases. Low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (AIV) have been extensively studied in wild birds in recent years in response to the emergence and dispersion of highly pathogenic AIV responsible for major health and economic threat  [2] . Shorebirds (Charadriiformes) are classically recognised, together with ducks, geese and swans (Anseriformes), as the major natural reservoir of AIV  [3, 4] . Globally and locally, the typical prevalence of AIV infection in shorebird species sampled worldwide is low (c. 1%)  [3] [4] [5] [6]  as compared with prevalence in ducks (c. 10% globally with seasonal peaks of 20-60%)  [3, 4] . There is, however, one notable exception: a high AIV prevalence (.10%) has been consistently reported in the ruddy turnstone (Arenaria interpres) sampled in May during spring migration at Delaware Bay, USA  [5, 7, 8] . This particular species, season and site combination represent the only known shorebird-AIV hotspot worldwide at which the infection rate is consistently higher than elsewhere in the world  [5, 6, 8] . Delaware Bay is one of the world's largest congregation sites of shorebirds, supporting an estimated 1 million shorebirds stopping during spring migration. Surprisingly, all of the other shorebird species that mingle with the ruddy turnstones at Delaware Bay in May show a very low AIV prevalence (,2%)  [5, 9] . A low prevalence has also been found in shorebirds (including ruddy turnstone) stopping at Delaware Bay during autumn migration  [7, 10] . Shorebirds form the most abundant and the most species-rich group of waterbirds. Shorebirds are divided taxonomically into three major clades: the Scolopaci (sandpipers, snipes, phalaropes, jacanas), Lari (gulls, terns, auks, pratincoles, skuas) and Charadrii (plovers, oystercatchers, stilts)  [11] . Most species share a set of ecological characteristics that are favorable to the transmission and dispersion of AIV: (i) they are generally highly gregarious (at least outside the breeding season), congregating at very high densities at key staging sites along migratory flyways, where they form multispecies foraging or roosting flocks; (ii) most species are very long-distance migrants, including some that undertake non-stop flights of up to 11,000 km  [12] ; and (iii) many shorebirds breeding in the Northern hemisphere winter in the Southern hemisphere; in this way they connect the northern hemisphere waterbird fauna to the regions south of the equator that are not reached by migratory ducks. Characterisation of AIVs isolated from shorebirds suggests that they play a key role in the perpetuation of AIV in wild bird communities. The majority of inter-continental exchange and reassortment of AIV genes between Nearctic and Palaearctic regions has, although uncommon, been reported in shorebirds  [13, 14] . A larger variety of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase combination subtypes has been found in shorebirds than in ducks  [8, 10]  suggesting that shorebirds may maintain a wider spectrum of viruses than ducks  [3] . Furthermore, phylogenetic studies consistently indicate the existence of a large overlap between the gene pools of viruses that originate from both ducks and shorebirds  [13, 15] , suggesting that AIVs are commonly transmitted between those two groups of species. It is not currently known whether Delaware Bay constitutes the world's only shorebird AIV hotspot or whether other hotspots exist, in particular at other large shorebird congregation sites  [5, 6] . Published studies have limitations in their geographic scope, numbers of sampled birds, taxonomic range, and ability to detect AIVs. So far there have been relatively few intensive studies of AIV infection in shorebirds outside Delaware Bay (see  [6]  for a review) and it is unclear whether the number of birds sampled at other locations and times has been adequate to detect hotspots. Most of the shorebirds that have been tested belong to only two (Scolopacidae and Laridae) of the 19 families of Charadriiformes. In addition, almost all AIV infection studies in shorebirds have relied only on cloacal or fresh fecal samples  [6, 8, 16, 17] , whilst oropharyngeal samples have been tested on very few occasions  [8, 18] . Several recent studies of Anseriformes provide evidence of the importance of the respiratory tract for the replication of AIV  [2, 19]  and demonstrate the complementary nature of cloacal and oropharyngeal samples, since birds are rarely found concurrently infected from both types of samples  [8, 20] . Results from experimental infection studies also suggest that oropharyngeal excretion may be predominant for some AIV subtypes in gulls  [21, 22] . As a result of these various limitations, some hotspots of AIV infection in shorebirds may have remained undetected. As this summary implies, the significance of interspecific variation in AIV prevalence among shorebirds, and in particular the high prevalence in the ruddy turnstone, remains unclear. Ruddy turnstones have rarely been tested for AIV infection outside Delaware Bay (only 9%, see supporting information  Table  S1 ). It remains to be determined whether this species is associated with AIV hotspots in other sites or if other species are involved. In this study we investigated the possibility that other AIV hotspots may be associated with large shorebird congregation sites or with alternative species. First, we conducted a survey of AIV infection in shorebirds, including ruddy turnstone, at the Banc d'Arguin in Mauritania (Table 1,  Figure 1 ). This site constitutes one of the largest wintering sites for shorebirds in the world (c. 2.3 million birds) and supports the greatest number of ruddy turnstones (c. 9,000 birds) across the old world  [23] . Second, we extended our analysis to a large-scale dataset of AIV prevalence in 69 shorebird species that we sampled in 25 countries at some of the most important shorebirds sites in Africa and Western Eurasia (  Figure 1 , and in supporting information  Table S2 ) during various international surveillance programs  [20, 24, 25] . We explored these data for the presence of potential hotspots of AIV infection in relation to the number of birds sampled at a given time and location. We also examined whether variations in prevalence could be linked to ecological factors that affect (i) the local persistence and transmission potential of AIV (such as the environment and local abundance of shorebirds) and (ii) the exposure of host species to AIV (such as their geographical range and foraging behaviour). Third, we conducted a serologic survey in some shorebird species to compare differences in previous AIV exposure between species throughout their annual range and identify the species that might potentially be involved in AIV transmission at other hotspots. 
 Methods 
 Ethics statement Birds used in this study were sampled from Botswana, Burkina Faso, Chad, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, Malawi, Mozambique, Ukraine, Senegal, Republic of Sudan, South Sudan, Tanzania, Tunisia, Turkey, Zambia and Zimbabwe (  Figure 1 ). Most birds were captured and released in the wild using conventional techniques (mist-nets and baited walk-in traps) covered in the Ornithological Council ''Guidelines to the Use of Wild Birds in Research''. Procedures for capture, handling, and sampling were approved by the Centre de Recherches par le Baguage des Populations d'Oiseaux (CRBPO, Natural History Museum Paris -French National Reference Bird Ringing Center). We conducted a serological survey on a subset of birds captured at two sampling sites (Banc d'Arguin, Mauritania; Inner Niger River Delta, Mali) (see below for details). A capture and sampling permit at the Banc d'Arguin was obtained from the Conseil Scientifique du Banc d'Arguin. Capture permits were similarly obtained from the relevant government authority in each country where field studies were conducted. All sampling activities were conducted in the presence of a representative from the animal health and veterinary national services and a representative from the environment national services.  On some occasions birds (8% of the total sample) were provided by hunters. Samples were collected from traditional or commercial safari hunting activities. Birds that had been killed by hunters had been hunted with appropriate permits from each relevant local authority and were obtained with the hunters' permission. None of the collected birds were protected. Safari operators conduct their activities through authorisations delivered by: Morocco: Haut Commissariat aux Eaux et Forêts et à la Lutte Contre la Désertification, Direction de la Lutte contre la Désertification et de la Protection de la Nature; Burkina Faso: Direction de la Faune et des Chasses; Chad: Direction de la Conservation de la Faune et des Aires Protégées. In two countries (Mali, Malawi) birds were acquired through local bird hunters who harvest birds for subsistence and to supplement and sustain the food resources of the local population. In Mali birds were acquired from local bird hunters through an official hunting and sampling authorisation delivered by the Direction National de la Conservation de la Nature (Félix Dakouo, National Director of the DNDN). In Malawi birds were acquired through registered bird hunters who belong to bird hunting clubs that form part of the Lake Chilwa Bird Hunters Association which was formed with the aim of sustainably managing the utilisation of sedentary and migratory waterbirds at Lake Chilwa; sampling authorisation was provided by the Wildlife Conservation Department, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. On two sampling occasions (Niger and Burkina Faso in 2006) birds were shot through special permits for sample collection in the framework of a national emergency surveillance operation implemented after the notifications of avian influenza highly pathogenic H5N1 outbreaks. These birds (n = 163) represent only 2% of the entire birds sampled in this study. Hunting authorisations were obtained from the Direction de la Conservation de la Nature for Niger (Ali Harouna, Director of the Direction de la Conservation de la Nature) and the Direction de la Faune et des Chasses for Burkina Faso (Urbain Belemsobgo, Director of the Direction de la Faune et des Chasses). 
 The Banc d'Arguin The Banc d'Arguin National Park is located near the 20 th parallel and extends .180 km along the Atlantic coast of Mauritania, bordered by the Sahara desert (  Figure 1 ). This area of about 500 km 2 of very shallow intertidal flats is flooded by upwelling of cold water rich in nutrients. This exceptional ecosystem is the wintering site with the highest density of shorebirds along the East Atlantic Flyway  [26] . It also represents a crossroads for migratory shorebirds breeding in the Palearctic, Nearctic and Afro-tropical regions and wintering along the African coast. 
 Sampling and AIV detection procedures Shorebirds were sampled at the Banc d'Arguin on five occasions between 2006 and 2010  (Table 1) . Samples were collected during the same period at 30 other sites in 25 countries (  Figure 1 , and supporting information  Table S2 ). Sampling was conducted on a different number of occasions according to sites and years. Three types of samples were collected that we distinguished in our subsequent analyses: a single cloacal or fecal swab, a single oropharyngeal swab, or both cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs tested separately. All samples were collected using cotton swabs and stored in cryovials containing a viral transport medium. Cryovials were stored in liquid nitrogen directly in the field and every effort was made to maintain the cold chain using cryopacks with dry ice during international shipment to the laboratory. Samples were analysed in different laboratories using a similar standard diagnostic procedure based on RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR virus detection (rRT-PCR) targeting the matrix gene specific for influenza A viruses. Positive samples were also inoculated into embryonated SPF chicken eggs for virus isolation and typed according to standard procedures. Further details on sampling and diagnostic procedures can be found in a previous publication  [20] . We computed the observed prevalence for each species for each sampling occasion as the percentage of individuals found positive for AIV compared with the total number of birds tested. 
 Presence of hotspots of AIV infection We defined a hotspot as a specific location and time at which the AIV infection rate is consistently elevated and about an order of magnitude greater than in other sites, using 10% as a minimum prevalence threshold according to long-term prevalence measures in ruddy turnstone at Delaware Bay  [5, 8] . We compared the number of AIV-positive birds detected on each sampling occasion (considering birds from all species altogether or from each species separately) with a threshold number of positive birds for a sample of the same size below which the prevalence is unlikely (probability ,0.05) to be greater than 10%. This threshold was defined as the 0.05 quantile of a binomial distribution B(n = sample size, p = 0.10) (stats R package, qbinom procedure). If the observed number of AIV-positive birds on a sampling occasion was below the threshold defined for a sample of the same size, we concluded that prevalence in the population from which the sample had been drawn was most likely lower than 10%. We restricted our analysis to sampling units that had at least 28 birds sampled (28 being the minimum number of individuals required to be 95% confident of detecting at least one infected bird when prevalence is $10%). 
 Variations in AIV prevalence in shorebirds across Eurasian and Afro-tropical regions Explanatory variables tested in this analysis are summarized in  Table 2 . Species behavioral and ecological traits were taken from literature (body mass, main foraging technique:  [27, 28] ; geographic range:  [23] ). We restricted our analysis to species that had at least 20 individuals sampled. Sampling sites were classified according to four abundance classes of shorebird populations estimated from counts compiled in  [23] . We explored the relationships between AIV prevalence and explanatory variables using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) with a binomial error distribution and a logit link function (lme4 R package, glmer procedure). We tested the independence among categorical variables (phi coefficient) to identify potential collinearity issues. Samples had usually been collected on several occasions at the same site or during the same year; to avoid pseudo-replication we included a year and a site random effect in models. The potential aggregation of infected birds within a given sampling occasion was also accounted for by incorporating the sampling occasion as a random effect nested within year and site. Finally, we included a random laboratory effect to account for a potential difference in diagnostic sensitivity among laboratories. Our analysis consisted of two steps. First, we tested for environmental, seasonal and species variation in prevalence, accounting for differences in the types of sample tested. The two variables related to the sampling site (abundance and environment) were considered associated (phi coefficient .0.28) and were tested alternatively in models. We constructed a full model including four explanatory variables (species, season, sampling procedure and abundance/or environment,) as fixed effects and four random factors (year, site, sampling occasion and laboratory). The goodness-of-fit of the model was assessed using the Pearson Chi-Square statistic. The initial full model was simplified by a stepwise backwards elimination of non-significant variables. We used likelihood ratio tests (LRT) to test the significance of each variable, computing the x2 of the LRT between the model retaining and the model excluding the variable. We first explore the random part of the model, iteratively removing from the model the random factors with the lower estimated variance components. We then explored the fixed part, iteratively removing variables that had the lowest explanatory power (highest P values, t-test) to identify the minimal adequate model. In a second step we tested whether species variation in prevalence was related to species traits that may affect exposure and immunity to re-infection (  Table 2 ). In most ecosystems, cohabiting shorebird species are separated in space and time through dietary preferences and foraging techniques leading to potential differences in exposure to infection. Shorebirds of the Scolpaci (sandpipers and allies) and Charadrii (plovers and allies) clades use two main sensory mechanisms to detect their prey: species relying on tactile sensation that forage mainly by probing prey continuously beneath the substrates may have a higher AIV exposure by comparison to species that use visual mechanisms and forage by pecking prey from the surface. Moreover, differences in foraging strategy lead to variations in vigilance; tactile-foraging species tend to form larger foraging flocks than visual-foraging species  [29]  and hence may be subject to higher contact rates and inter-individual AIV transmission. Species heterogeneity in transmission rate may be caused by latitudinal and habitat differences in AIV exposure. Environmental persistence of AIV is reduced by salinity. A lower AIV exposure is expected in the high Arctic regions where shorebirds breed at low density, forage mainly on terrestrial invertebrates in moist or dry habitat and where the dabbling ducks of the Anas genus (presumably the main AIV maintenance hosts  [3] ) are largely absent. High Arctic breeding shorebird species winter predominantly in coastal-saline environments  [30]  and therefore remain year-round in AIV-poor environments, whereas species breeding in sub-Arctic to temperate regions winter mainly in inland-freshwater wetlands where the potential for AIV infection is higher (freshwater, cohabitation with dabbling ducks of the Anas genus). Eurasian migratory species wintering in Africa move between vastly separated areas with distinct waterbird communities and hence are likely to be exposed to a higher diversity of AIVs than Afro-tropical species that reside year-round within sub-Saharan regions where AIVs generally circulate at a lower level than in temperate or boreal wetlands  [20] . In the second step we followed the same model selection procedure as in the first step, starting from the previous minimum adequate model but substituting the variable ''species'' with variables describing species traits. Since demographic turnover rate in birds is related to body size at the inter-specific level, we included among the potential explanatory variables body mass (log transformed) as a proxy for turnover rate of susceptible birds in the population. In order to account for non-independence between species owing to phylogeny we included a hierarchical taxonomic (Clade-Family-Genus-Species) nested error structure as random effects in the model. The foraging and range classes defined for the Scolopaci and Charadrii were not appropriate for species belonging to the Lari clade (most gull and tern species that we sampled remained year-round in coastal habitats and forage using either specialized techniques, such as aerial-plunging in terns, or opportunism in gulls); they were removed from this second analysis. 
 Serological survey of antibodies to AIV We conducted a serological survey on a subset of birds captured at two sampling sites (Banc d'Arguin, Mauritania; Inner Niger Delta, Mali) during three sampling occasions at each site. Birds were ringed and aged (first year, $second year, undetermined) on the basis of plumage characteristics, and a blood sample was collected from the jugular vein. We tested individual serum samples for the presence of antibodies specific to the AIV nucleoprotein by using a commercial blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (bELISA) kit (FlockCheck AI MultiS-Screen nucleoprotein antibody test kit, IDEXX Laboratories) following the manufacturer's instructions. All samples were run in combi-  Table 2 . List of the explanatory variables tested to explain geographical, seasonal and species variations in AIV prevalence in shorebirds across Eurasian and Afro-tropical regions (  Figure 1 ). nation with supplied positive and negative controls for validation. Optical density (OD) values were read at 650 nm and sample with S/N values (ratio of the sample OD to the kit negative control mean OD),0.50 were considered positive for antibodies to AIV. We also tested a subset of samples from different species at both sites using a second commercially competitive ELISA kit (ID screen, influenza A nucleoprotein antibody competition, ID.VET) following the manufacturer's instructions. We evaluated the reproducibility of diagnostic results using i) the McNemar's test (exact binomial test for correlated proportions) to assess if proportions of positive results differed between the two Elisa assays, and ii) the Cohen's Kappa statistic to measure the level of agreement between the two tests beyond chance. Seroprevalence of antibodies to AIV was computed for each species and sampling occasion from results of the first diagnostic assay. We investigated the variations in seroprevalence using a GLMM approach, as described above. We tested for effects of age and species as fixed factors, accounting for potential pseudoreplication issues by including year, site and sampling occasions as random factors. We also restricted this analysis to species that had at least 20 individuals sampled. 
 Results 
 AIV circulation at PNBA, Mauritania A total of 2018 shorebirds were sampled at the Banc d'Arguin. AIV was detected on four out of the five sampling occasions and in almost all species, but at a consistently low prevalence (,2%,  Table 1 ). Only one AIV-positive ruddy turnstone was found, and the proportion of birds found infected with AIV in this species (0.6%, n = 158) was not significantly different from that in other shorebird species (0.8%, n = 1860) (x2 = 0.06, p.0.5). We also found no difference in infection rate for all shorebird species between sampling occasions conducted at the beginning (Nov-Dec: 0.9%, n = 894) and the end (Feb-Apr: 0.7%, n = 1124) of the wintering period (x2 = 0.21, p.0.5). 
 Presence of AIV hotspots in shorebirds across Eurasian and Afro-tropical regions Altogether, a total of 7715 birds belonging to 69 species from 10 shorebird families were tested for AIV infection during 86 sampling occasions at 31 sites (in supporting information  Table  S3 ). The global prevalence was low: AIV infection was detected in only 1.4% (n = 107) of birds tested. Two AIVs were isolated, an H1N1 virus in dunlin (Calidris alpina) in Turkey and an H10N7 virus in Spotted Redshank (Tringa erythropus) in Romania. Our analysis for the presence of potential AIV hotspots in the shorebirds revealed that on most sampling occasions, the number of AIV-positive birds detected was below the threshold number of infected individuals expected for a prevalence of at least 10% (  Figure 2 ). For about 90% of sampling occasions when at least 28 birds were tested (42 out of 47 occasions) we can be 95% confident that prevalence was lower than 10%. We found similar results when we considered each shorebird species separately (supporting information  Figure S1 ). On only five sampling occasions (  Table 3 ) the number of positive birds was too large for rejecting the hypothesis that prevalence could be at least 10%. For these, we could not exclude the presence of a hotspot of AIV infection. Interestingly, three of these sampling occasions originated from the same site (Lakes Manyame-Chivero, Zimbabwe) and from the same bird species   (Table 3) . 
 Variations in AIV prevalence in shorebirds across Eurasian and Afro-tropical regions Although AIV prevalence was generally low, AIV infection was relatively ubiquitous in shorebirds across Eurasian and Afrotropical regions. AIV positive individuals were found in a large number of bird species (n = 26) of both Eurasian and Afro-tropical origin, belonging to various families including Scolopacidae (13 species), Charadriidae (8), Laridae  (7) , Jacanidae (1) and Glareolidae (1) (in supporting information  Table S3 ). Infection with AIV was reported for the first time in about two thirds (n = 18) of these species. AIVs were also detected in birds sampled throughout the year, in all study regions, and in both inlandfreshwater and coastal-saline environments. In our first analysis of the environmental, seasonal and species variations in prevalence, we found that the sampling occasion accounted for most of the variance in the random part (random effect variance estimation = 4.47). The inclusion of each of the other random factors (laboratory, site and year) did not improve the model fit (LRT, p.0.5). We therefore included sampling occasion as a random effect in all subsequent models. During our selection procedure among explanatory variables we found that only sampling procedure and species had a significant effect on   Table  S2 ). The number of AIV-positive birds detected in relation to the number of birds sampled per sampling occasion is here compared to the threshold number of positive birds (solid line) below which the prevalence is unlikely (probability ,0.05) to be greater than 10% for a sample of the same size. Points on or above the line represent potential AIV hotspots, i.e. sampling occasions (n = 5) for which the number of positive birds was too large for rejecting the hypothesis that prevalence could be .10% (see  Table 3 ). Only sampling occasions (n = 47) that had at least 28 birds sampled were considered in this analysis. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0046049.g002 variation in prevalence  (Table 4 ). Prevalence was significantly higher for birds tested concurrently for both cloacal and oropharyngeal samples than in birds tested for a single cloacal sample (Z value = 2.29, p = 0.022). However, prevalence was similar between birds tested for a single cloacal or a single oropharyngeal sample (Z value = 0.93, p = 0.35). We detect a significant variation in prevalence between species but no species had prevalence significantly different from the prevalence estimated for the ruddy turnstone. We did not detect a statistical difference in prevalence between seasons, the type of environment or the abundance classes of shorebirds at the sampling site (  Table 4 ). The variable species and sampling procedures were also significant when we restricted our analysis to Scolopaci and Charadrii. None of the variables related to species traits (geographic range, foraging behaviour and body mass), however, was a significant predictor of AIV prevalence and only the variable sampling procedure was retained in the selection process (  Table 4) . None of the nested taxonomic levels (Clade-Family-Genus-Species) included as a random effect received statistical support from the data and sampling occasion accounted for most of the variance of the random part (variance estimation = 4.89). 
 Seroprevalence of antibodies to AIV The presence of antibodies specific to AIV was investigated in a total of 930 birds belonging to 23 species (in supporting information  Table S4 ). The overall seroprevalence was 17.6% and was highly variable between species, ranging from 0 to 77%. The reproducibility of diagnostic results, evaluated by testing a subset of samples (n = 258) using a second ELISA kit, was high: we found no significant difference in the proportion of positive samples between the two ELISA assays (McNemar's chi-squared = 5.79, df = 1, p-value = 0.016) with an almost perfect agreement (Kappa test = 0.87, p,0.001). Our GLMM analysis indicated that seroprevalence was unrelated to age (x2 = 0.79, df = 12, p = 0.67) but varied significantly between species (x2 = 281.31, df = 10, p,0.001). Age also had no significant effect when we excluded birds of unknown age (x2 = 2.61, df = 12, p = 0.11). Seroprevalence was significantly higher in the red knot Calidris canutus   Table S5 ). No AIV antibodies were found in species sampled in the Inner Niger Delta, in either Eurasian migrants (ruff Philomachus pugnax, wood sandpiper Tringa glareola) or Afrotropical species (African jacana, painted snipe Rostratula benghalensis, spurwinged lapwing Vanellus spinosus) (in supporting information  Table  S4 ). As in the analysis of AIV infection rate we found that the sampling occasion accounted for most of the variance of the random part (variance estimation = 0.41) while the inclusion of each of the other random factors (site and year) did not improve the model fit (LRT, p.0.5). The limited number of species in the data set precluded tests of the relationship between species traits and variation in seroprevalence in our modelling analysis. We note, however, that a high seroprevalence was found in both one mainly tactile (red knot) and one mainly visual-foraging species (ruddy turnstone) at the Banc d'Arguin and that globally, no difference was found between species using these two distinct foraging strategies (x2 = 0.45, df = 1, p = 0.50). Among species originating from Arctic breeding ground and wintering in the coastal environment of the Banc These sites correspond to sampling occasions (top) at which the number of AIV-positive birds was above the threshold number of birds for which the hypothesis that prevalence is lower than 10% could not be rejected (see  Figure 2 ). Sampling conducted in different years at the same sites during the same months and on the same species (below) detected a low number of AIV-positive birds. d'Arguin we found both species with high (red knot, ruddy turnstone) and low seroprevalence (dunlin, sanderling). 
 Discussion Despite an unprecedentedly large geographic and taxonomic coverage we did not detect any hotspots of AIV infection in shorebirds that matched the criterion that infection rate should be consistently elevated and about an order of magnitude greater than in other sites ($10%). We did find a relatively high infection rate at one of our sampling sites -Lakes Manyame-Chivero, Zimbabwe -on three distinct occasions, representing different seasons (Sep. and Nov.-late dry season, Jan.-wet season) and years  (2007 and 2008) . These two adjacent lakes, though of relatively small area (65 and 185 km2, respectively) represent a key site for shorebirds in Zimbabwe  [23]  and AIV has been detected continuously in the wild bird community present at these lakes  [33] . The relatively low number of individuals sampled per species and sampling occasions limit our ability to identify the species associated with this potential hotspot. The African jacana was the shorebird species that was most commonly sampled and the most frequently found infected at the Lakes Manyame-Chivero, but surprisingly no African jacana was found infected at any other sites across Africa despite a relatively large number of individuals sampled (n = 312 birds). Follow-up sampling studies conducted at Lakes Manyame-Chivero in following years during the same season and on the same species consistently detected AIV-positive birds but at a lower infection rate, making us unable to confirm the existence of a recurrent AIV hotspot at this site. Peaks in AIV prevalence may be associated with very narrow seasonal windows (e.g., few weeks in May at the Delaware Bay  [6, 9] ). However the timing of these seasonal windows may be more variable in tropical than in temperate ecosystems. The high variability of seasonal rainfall in the tropics and the related fluctuations in the timing of reproduction and congregation of waterbirds may produce different seasonal dynamics of AIV infection between years. The inter-annual difference in prevalence measured at Lakes Manyame-Chivero may result from a difference in lake level and the related difference in the local density of waterbirds  [33] . The overall absence of shorebird-AIV hotspots in our study is notable for several reasons. First, we looked for hotspots in a remarkably large number of species (n = 69) from ten shorebird families, including species and families that had never been tested for AIV infection before. This wide exploration identified many new AIV host species. Second, the majority of birds were tested for AIV infection from both cloacal and oropharyngeal samples. As predicted, a significantly higher prevalence was found in birds tested using both types of sample than those using one type of sample only. Among birds (n = 4711) tested for both cloacal and   [8, 31] ) using the same commercial bELISA kit (see Methods). The mean species breeding latitude was computed from the northern and southern limits of the breeding distribution of the populations present at each site using distribution maps from  [22, 32] . Species include ruddy turnstone (D), red knot (%), dunlin (o), sanderling (e), short-billed dowitcher (6), ruff and wood sandpiper  (2) . Error bars represent the binomial exact 95% confidence interval. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0046049.g003  Table 4 . Results of the model selection procedure relating variations in AIV prevalence in shorebirds across Eurasia and Africa to species ecological traits, sampling procedure, period and ecological characteristics of the sampling site. oropharyngeal samples, few birds were found positive concurrently for both types of sample (n = 3), while birds were found positive as frequently from cloacal samples only (n = 34) as from oropharyngeal samples only (n = 36) (McNemar's chi-squared = 0.01, df = 1, p-value = 0.90). Moreover, the two viruses isolated in this study originated from both an oropharyngeal (dunlin/H1N1) and a cloacal sample (spotted redshank/H10N7). Though these results confirm the importance of the respiratory tract for the replication of AIV in shorebirds as previously shown for wild ducks  [2, 19, 20] , neither the inclusion of new species nor the collection and testing of oropharyngeal swabs revealed new AIV hotspots. Major attention was given to the preservation of the cold chain from the field to the laboratory, although in some instances logistical constrains in remote field locations or unexpected international shipment delays may account for the low virus isolation rate obtained. However detection of AIV by rRT-PCR is insensitive to differences in cold-chain conditions and freeze-thaw cycles  [34]  therefore differences in storage conditions should not have affected our results. Third, we found a consistently low AIV prevalence in shorebirds in several sites that are, like Delaware Bay, large seasonal congregation sites of shorebirds. Prevalence was also not related to the abundance classes of shorebirds across all our sampling sites. With two million wintering shorebirds, about onethird of the entire East Atlantic Flyway population, the Banc d'Arguin clearly qualifies as one of the larger congregation sites of shorebirds in the world. Shorebirds forage on the intertidal flats of the Banc d'Arguin at a density four times as high as the average density recorded in the other major wintering sites along the East-Atlantic coast  [26] . Despite those ecological characteristics, we found a consistently low AIV prevalence in shorebirds, including in ruddy turnstone, sampled in various seasons and years at the Banc d'Arguin. We found a similarly low prevalence at other major shorebird congregation sites, including the Sivash (Crimea peninsula, Ukraine) and the Senegal River delta (Senegal-Mauritania). In  Figure 4  we present the distribution of the world's largest congregation sites of waders (i.e. shorebirds of the Scolpaci (sandpipers and allies) and Charadrii (plovers and allies) clades): AIV detection studies in these birds have been conducted for seven of these sites (including two from this study) but a high infection rate has been reported only at Delaware Bay (in supporting information  Table S6 ). Therefore, a large congregation of birds appears to be an insufficient condition for the existence of a hotspot of AIV infection. Another characteristic of Delaware Bay is the exceptionally high number of ruddy turnstones which represent the second most abundant shorebird species at this site (annual maximum counts range from c. 32,000 to 105,000 birds  [35] ). No other site worldwide supports such a concentration of ruddy turnstones. By comparison, the highest abundance of this species over Western Eurasia and Africa is found at the Banc d'Arguin in winter, with maximum annual counts fluctuating between c. 4,100 and 10,300 individuals  [23] . During spring migration, shorebirds gather at Delaware Bay to feed on the eggs of horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus) spawning in the bay. Variation in spawning activity and wave action creates patches of egg concentration where shorebirds forage in densities as high as 210 birds/m 2  [36] . Much lower shorebird densities are found at other sites where resources are more uniformly distributed over the intertidal zone (e.g. 7610  23  birds/m 2 on average at the Banc d'Arguin  [26] ). The exceptionally high abundance of ruddy turnstones, the unusually high foraging density of shorebirds and the potential variation in their feeding strategy associated with a unique food source (horseshoe crab eggs) may explain the specific AIV hotspot at the Delaware Bay. Our repeated sampling revealed a low but continuous circulation of AIVs in shorebirds at the Banc d'Arguin throughout the wintering period of Eurasian migrants. This coastal tropical site combines several constraints to virus persistence in the environment: high temperatures, solar radiations and wind exposure, salinity, little precipitations, and tidal washing of the tidal flats. The main maintenance hosts of AIVs (the dabbling ducks of the Anas genus) are also absent. The perpetuation of AIV throughout the wintering period, therefore, likely results from a continuous inter-individual transmission among shorebirds facilitated by the aggregation of birds into large flocks at a few high tide roosts. Besides its importance as a wintering site, the Banc d'Arguin is also a major staging site for migratory shorebirds: it represents the tip of a flyway funnel draining migratory birds breeding across the extensive Arctic tundra of North America and Eurasia through the Atlantic coast from Western Europe down to southern Africa  (Figure 1 ). Continuous AIV circulation at such a migration crossroad creates the potential for reassortment between AIV strains originating from different geographic areas as well as the potential for geographically extensive dispersal of new viruses. Globally, our results reveal a low but widespread circulation of AIV in shorebirds across Eurasian and Afro-tropical regions. AIVinfected shorebirds were detected in a large number of species, in all study regions and in both inland-freshwater and coastal-saline environments. This finding contrast with the absence of AIVs previously reported in studies of shorebirds in northern Europe  [3, 4]  and suggest that these birds play a role, as in the Americas, in the epidemiology of AIV in the old word. Results from our study also reveal that the ruddy turnstone is not consistently associated with AIV hotspots. Prevalence measured in this species was low and not significantly different from the prevalence measured in cohabiting species. Our multivariate analyses revealed the existence of significant species variations in AIV prevalence and seroprevalence. Contrary to our predictions, prevalence and seroprevalence were no lower in visual-foraging species (feeding mostly by pecking in small foraging flocks) than in tactile-foraging species (mainly probing in large foraging flocks). Nor were they lower in Arctic-coastal species that remain yearround in AIV-poor environments than in boreal-freshwater species (see methods). Conversely, no AIV antibodies were found in freshwater Eurasian or African shorebird species. This absence is striking, given that most of these freshwater shorebirds cohabit, sometimes in close proximity and high numbers, with potentially infectious wild ducks in boreal, temperate, and/or Afro-tropical wetlands. AIV-specific antibodies acquired after a natural infection have been reported to persist generally for not more than a year in captive mallards  [37]  and in free-ranging migratory geese  [38] . Similarly in this study we found no difference in seroprevalence between first-year and adults birds. Though the potential existence of long-lasting antibodies in shorebirds cannot be completely ruled out, the very high AIV antibody prevalence but low infection rate that we found at the Banc d'Arguin in red knot (c.80%) and ruddy turnstone (c. 50%) suggest that these species experienced a prior exposure to a relatively high AIV infection rate at other staging sites along their annual range. A similar pattern of high antibody prevalence (c. 50-90%,  [8, 31] ) and low infection rate (,1%,  [5, 9] ) was found in red knot at Delaware Bay, also suggesting a prior high AIV infection rate at other sites. These three bird populations have non-overlapping breeding ranges: the sub-species of red knot that winter or stop at the Banc d'Arguin (canutus) breed on the Taimyr Peninsula, western Siberia, whereas the sub-species that stop at Delaware Bay (rufa) breed in the central Canadian Arctic  [30] ; the ruddy turnstone of the Banc d'Arguin breed in both the north-eastern Canada and the Fennoscandia-west Russia regions  [23] . Very little information is available on the infection status of these populations along their migratory flyway, and hence the site and season where potentially high infection rates occur -i.e. potential AIV hotspots -remain to be discovered. Highly contrasting seroprevalence values were found at the Banc d'Arguin among four species -red knot, ruddy turnstone, dunlin and sanderling -that are ecologically and phylogenetically highly related. A very similar pattern in seroprevalence variation was found among the same species sampled at Delaware Bay  [8, 9, 31]    (Figure 3 ). The two species found with a high seroprevalence at both sites -red knot, ruddy turnstone -both breed in the high-Arctic, while closely related species with a lower seroprevalence have a more southerly breeding distribution (except the sanderling,  Figure 3 ). This finding is in contradiction with the adjustment to disease pressure hypothesis that predicts a lower exposure to pathogens and a lower investment in immune system in species breeding at higher latitudes as an adaptation to pathogen-poor environment and a trade-off to compensate the higher energetic costs associated with long-distance migration and breeding in climatically adverse conditions  [30, 39] . Studies conducted in the high Arctic regions (Svalbard  [38] , Chukchi Peninsula  [40] , Northern Alaska  [41] , Taimyr Peninsula  [42] ) have consistently reported no or very low AIV infection rate in wild birds. The low seroprevalence found in the sanderling -one of the more northerly breeding shorebird species -in both the Banc d'Arguin and Delaware Bay  (Figure 3 ) also suggests that the high Arctic is not the region where high AIV infection occurs. Differences in seroprevalence among these closely related shorebird species do not appear to be readily explained by environmental variables. They may instead result from an intrinsic difference between species in their receptivity to AIV infection, and/or in their ability to mount and maintain an acquired antibody-mediated (humoral) immune response. At Delaware Bay the low infection rate in several shorebird species commingling with ruddy turnstone at very high density to forage on the same egg resource also suggest the existence of species-level constraints to interspecies AIV transmission. The spectrum and the distribution of sialic acid receptors of AIV on host epithelial tissues varies substantially among closely related bird species  [22, 43]  and may lead to variations in permissiveness for infection and limit transmission between cohabiting species. Species-specific differences in acquired immune responses have also been found among closely related shorebird species after an experimental infection with the same antigens, with ruddy turnstone showing higher antibody responses than sanderling, ruff and red knot  [44] . The lower immune response of red knot compared to ruddy turnstone does not, however, fit with the high AIV antibody prevalence found in these two species. On few occasions the serological status of birds individually identified from their ring number could be controlled on consecutive sampling occasions at the Banc d'Arguin NP. One dunlin seroconverted between November 2009 and March 2010, as a result of an infection that probably occurred at the Banc d'Arguin, since this site constitutes the larger southernmost staging site of dunlin of its migration flyway  [23] . AIV was also detected by rRT-PCR in a red knot sampled in March 2010 that had been previously found seropositive in November 2009; this bird was still seropositive in March 2010. This suggests that acquired immunity is only partial and that a prior exposure does not fully protect against a subsequent AIV infection. In summary, our study reveals that, when considered separately, the individual features associated with a disease hotspot do not systematically produce a locally and temporally high transmission rate in other contexts. Outside Delaware Bay, the ruddy turnstone has not been found infected at a higher prevalence than other shorebird species (in supporting information  Table S1 ). In addition, no AIV-hotspot has been found at any of the other world's largest shorebird congregation sites investigated so far  (Figure 4 , supporting information  Table S6 ). Different constituents should be combined to generate an exceptionally high transmission rate. To what extent the constituents (species, environment, and season) of AIV hotspots are identical and temporally stable, hence predictable, remains to be elucidated  [1] . More generally, we suggest that interpreting existing hotspots in light of data from other ecosystems and pathogens should help to understand and work towards a more general model of hotspots.  Figure S1  Number of AIV-positive birds detected per species for a given sampling occasion compared to the threshold number of positive birds (solid line) below which the prevalence is unlikely (probability ,0.05) to be greater than 10% for a sample of the same size. Points on or above the line represent potential species-hotspots, i.e. species for a given sampling occasion (n = 11) for which the number of positive birds was too large for rejecting the hypothesis that prevalence could be .10%. Only species sampling occasions (n = 89) that had at least 28 birds sampled were considered in this analysis. (DOCX)

Epidemics of RVF in livestock mainly cause abortions and neonatal deaths. In humans, symptoms are usually non-specific causing an influenza-like syndrome, but sometimes infection can also result in meningoencephalitis, haemorrhagic fever and death  [1] . Since its first description in Kenya in 1931  [2] , RVF has been reported in Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as in  Egypt (1977) , in  Madagascar (1979) , in the Arabian Peninsula  (2000) , and in the islands of the Comoros archipelago (2007)  [3] ; the latter being located in the North of the Mozambique Channel, between Mozambique and Madagascar  (Fig 1) . RVF is transmitted to mammals mainly by mosquito bites (main vectors belong to the genera Aedes and Culex). The hypotheses underlying RVF virus emergence is the concomitance of (i) the presence of susceptible livestock, (ii) an increase in vector abundance (e.g. due to heavy rainfall) thereby facilitating virus amplification and transmission, and (iii) the presence of the virus itself. The virus may be imported through the movements of infectious animals or arthropod vectors, or be present locally. RVF virus may persist between epidemics at a low level in livestock causing sporadic cases, or be maintained in potential local reservoirs. The latter includes vertical transmission in mosquito eggs and a large range of wild mammalian hosts, such as buffaloes, rodents and bats, although no good evidence exists on the latter hypothesis  [4] [5] [6] . Humans may acquire the virus mainly by contact with infectious animal tissues, and also possibly via mosquito bites  [1] . In Mayotte, RVF virus was detected for the first time in 2007 in humans  [7, 8] . Sequencing related this virus to the 2006-2007 eastern African Kenya-1 lineage  [9] , suggesting a recent import onto the island from the African mainland. Retrospective serological analyses conducted on livestock sera (collected between 2004 and 2008) showed that RVF virus had been on the island at least since 2004, so before the 2007 introduction, but no virus sequencing had been done  [10] . Since 2009, an on-going disease surveillance system (SESAM, Système d'Epidémiosurveillance Animale à Mayotte) has been monitoring livestock health status, and collecting livestock sera. This paper aims at presenting eleven years (2004-15) of RVF serological data, merging the 2004-08 dataset presented in Cetre-Sossah et al.  [10] , the 2012-13 dataset presented in Cavalerie et al.  [11] , with all other serological analyses conducted between 2008 and 2015. This large dataset collected on an insular territory represents a unique opportunity to study RVF epidemiology. It will be used to describe the past and current RVF status in Mayotte and propose relevant further data collection and mathematical modelling work to study RVF virus dynamics. 
 Methods 
 Study site The island of Mayotte is a French overseas department that belongs to the Comoros archipelago  (Fig 1) . It is a small island of 374km 2 (about 35km North-South and 10km East-West), with a high population density (212,600 inhabitants in 2012 [12]). The estimated livestock population is approximately 20,000 cattle and 13,000 small ruminants (sheep and goats). Average herd size is rather small (5 animals); with animals mainly kept outdoors year round and raised for family consumption or cultural ceremonies  [13, 14] . 
 Livestock data Livestock (cattle and small ruminants) serological data were collated from different sources. The 2004-08 data were retrospective serological surveys  [10] ; whilst prospective data collections were conducted in 2008-15. The different surveys collated and the serological testing data are presented in  Table 1 , and detailed hereinafter. Serological testing. All sera were tested for IgG (ID Screen RVF Competition ELISA (IDVet, Grabels, France)) or IgM (ID Screen RVF IgM Capture ELISA (IDVet, Grabels, France)) antibodies by ELISA. For RVF, IgG antibodies are detectable in the blood of infected animals approximately 10 days post-infection (PI), and are believed to remain detectable for several years PI. IgM are detected earlier (approximately 5 days PI), but remain detectable for only approximately 3 months PI  [1] . Therefore, the presence of IgG indicates animals ever infected, whilst IgM indicates those recently infected. Retrospective cross-sectional serological surveys 2004-08. These surveys (surveys 1-6,  Table 1 ) were carried out in 2008, when RVF virus was isolated in humans. They aimed to determine whether RVF was also or had previously been present in livestock, tracing back as far as possible. Little detail is available on how animals were selected in all those surveys; therefore we considered these as convenience sampled. Surveys 1-6 are ordered in  Table 1  based on the date of animal sampling. The specific order in which these surveys were conducted is however know, presented in Cetre-Sossah et al. 2012  [10]  and reminded below, together with the maximum information available. The first retrospective cross-sectional surveys were surveys 6a-c conducted in March 2008  (Table 1) . These included 29 illegally imported goats (survey 6a), 79 native cattle from the island living close to these goats (survey 6b), and additional 78 cattle sampled from other areas of the island (survey 6c). Whilst surveys 6a and 6b were targeted surveys in specific areas exposed to receiving illegally imported animals, survey 6c tested animals from different areas of the island. All sera were tested for IgG, and a subsample (26 sera chosen randomly) was also tested for IgM, to look for recent infections. The second retrospective survey (survey 5) aimed at further exploring the geographical extent of past RVF infections, and analysed sera collected between June 2007 and May 2008, from herds sampled across the island. Finally, surveys 1-4 explored whether RVF had been present in Mayotte before the introduction of the 2006-2007 eastern African Kenya-1 lineage. These tested sera were randomly selected among sera collected for brucellosis prophylaxis (between 2004 and 2007), which were stored at the Veterinary Services offices. For surveys 1-5, sera were tested for IgG only. Prospective serological surveys 2008-15. The first longitudinal study was conducted in small ruminants between June 2008 and February 2009. A total of 272 animals were sampled on the first occasion in June 2008, from 13 herds. These herds were selected across the island. Three months later, in September 2008, 76 animals were resampled, drawn only from herds negative in June 2008; and 79 animals from these herds were sampled again in February 2009 (surveys 7a, 7b and 7c in  Table 1 )  [10] . An animal disease surveillance system was created in 2009 (SESAM, survey 8 in  Table 1 ), whose target population was the livestock of Mayotte, and the source population (or sampling frame) was the official farm registry of the Chambre de l'Agriculture, de la Pêche et de l'Aquaculture de Mayotte (CAPAM). SESAM has been sampling livestock across the island selected from that list, based on farmers' accessibility, agreement to be visited, and availability on the day of visit. Farms have been visited once or several times, with no strict regular temporal pattern due to resources and logistical reasons. Animals present on the farm on the day of the visit were sampled for RVF (and other diseases). Most importantly, animals were sampled regardless of their RVF status at the previous visit. Therefore, the design of data collection resembles a repeated cross-sectional design. Between May 2009 and June 2015, a total of 4565 blood samples from 2550 animals (75% cattle and 25% small ruminants, and about 70% females and 30% males) and 194 herds have been tested for RVF antibodies. The mean herd size was 9 (median = 7, interquartile range IQR =  [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] ). From these 4565 blood samples, all were tested for IgG only, and 32.8% (n = 1497) were tested for both IgG and IgM. IgM testing was randomly done on a subsample of sera when funding was available. IgM testing was independent of the IgG serology results. Ethics statement. The studies were implemented with the approval of the Direction of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (DAAF) of Mayotte. Before 2015, animal sampling in this study was not subject to the approval of ethics committee nor to specific national of international regulations at the time of sample collection. Consent for blood sampling on a herd was obtained from its owner verbally after information in French (official language) or Shimaore (local language) was given. The animals were bled without suffering. No endangered or protected species were involved in the survey. For the 2015 data, all procedures on living animals were approved by the London School of Hygiene Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Board. 
 Climate data Rainfall and temperature are known to drive vector abundance and competence. The climate in Mayotte is marine tropical, with little temperature variation (average year round 24-34°C), but important rainfall (1500mm on average per year). Two main seasons are observed: hot rainy (December to March), and dry cool (June to September)  [15] . In order to compare serological results to rainfall and temperature, data from 2004 to 2015 were sourced  [16] . Monthly total rainfall and average temperature values were plotted against time, together with their average values by calendar month. 
 Data processing and descriptive statistics The total dataset included the results of 5720 samples from 3529 animals (from 448 herds, average herd size = 7.4, median = 5, IQR = [2-10]), sampled from and collected over 11 years (October 2004 to June 2015). All 5720 blood samples were tested for IgG, and 26.5% (n = 1513) were tested for both IgG and IgM. The dataset used the data from surveys 1 to 5, 6c, 7a and 8  (Table 1 ), defined as cross-sectional or repeated cross-sectional studies. Surveys 7b and 7c (the follow-up of the longitudinal study, totalling 155 sera) were not included as they clearly indicated measures of disease incidence; neither survey 6a nor 6b, as they were both targeted surveys. Due to the small size of Mayotte, estimates were produced for the whole island, as a single spatial epidemiological unit. Temporal pattern of RVF seroprevalence. To look for the potential variation of RVF seroprevalence over the 2004-15 period, monthly and annual IgG and IgM prevalence estimates were plotted against time. For both IgG and IgM, monthly and annual prevalence were estimated as the number of RVF positive animals per month (or year) divided by the number of animals tested in that month (or year), accounting for clustering using the one-stage cluster sampling method varbin, from the aod R package  [17] . When an animal was sampled more than once per year, it was counted once in the annual estimate, being classified as positive if at least one test was positive, and negative otherwise. Annual seroprevalence estimates were obtained by aggregating data from July of year y to June of year y+1. This temporal aggregation (named hereinafter ""epidemiological year"") allowed estimating annual prevalences by capturing each rainy season as a whole, as opposed to aggregating by calendar year. Age-stratified IgG prevalence. The livestock national identification database implemented in 2008  [14]  provided the dates of birth for approximately 53% (n = 1346 animals) of the sampled animals from survey 8. To get insight on RVF dynamics through time, age-stratified IgG prevalence for each epidemiological year was estimated, starting in 2008-09. 
 Results After examining the annual IgG and IgM prevalences  (Fig 2A and 2B , S1  Table) , and IgG prevalence by age group  (Fig 3A-3G , S2  Table)  we divided the study period into three phases. Phase 1 is the period with less information available. It includes the first four epidemiological years 2004-05, 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08, during which IgG annual observed prevalence remained at 15% or less  (Fig 2A) . Newly infected animals were reported in 2007-08 (  Fig  2B,  IgM positive animals), but the information was scarce, and no information on the age of animals was available. Phase 2 (2008-09 and 2009-10) suggests recent transmission of the virus. Indeed, IgG annual prevalences were significantly higher compared to the rest of the study period, reaching their maximum average value of 36% in 2008-09 (N = 142, n = 51, 95% CI ). In addition,  Fig 2B shows     (Fig 3A and 3B) . Phase 3 (2010-11 to 2014-15) suggests a decrease in RVF virus transmission. IgG annual prevalence was significantly lower than during phase 2, at approximately 10-15%  (Fig 2A) , and a steep drop in the number of new infections was observed, with IgM prevalence in 2010-11 being only 4% (N = 109, n = 4, 95% CI [0-7]) (  Fig 2B) . In addition, young animals (1 to 4 years old) were less affected over time, and the IgG seropositive animals were older than 5 years (  Fig  3C-3G    (Fig 2A) ; and very few young animals were positive between 2012-13 and 2014-15  (Fig 3E-3G) . Although no animals were IgM positive in 2014-15  (Fig 2B) , two animals in the one-year old group were found IgG positive, indicating that the virus may have been still circulating  (Fig 3G) . Finally, monthly rainfall pattern, and average monthly rainfall are shown in  Fig 2A and 2B . Monthly rainfall varied over the study period (ranging from 2.40 to 540 mm, S3  Table) . During phase 2 and in 2014-15, peaks of above-average rainfall were observed; whilst high IgM prevalence was reported in May-July 2009 during the dry season  (Fig 2B) . Temperature values were available for the period 2005 to 2015  (Fig 2A and 2B) . Their range was narrow, with average monthly values varying between 24.7 and 28.1°C over the entire study period, and extreme monthly average minimum and maximum temperature values between 19.8°C and 32.8°C (S3  Table) . 
 Discussion The analyses of serological data showed that Mayotte probably experienced an RVF epidemic in livestock around 2008-10. Peaks of above-average rainfall were observed during the epidemic phase, while variation of temperature was limited. The RVF virus seems to have Serological data were collected throughout the period 2004-15, although not in a standardised manner. Retrospective data were obtained from sera stored at the Veterinary Services office. These sera were collected prior to RVF detection on the island, and it was not possible to determine exactly how this sampling was conducted in livestock. Although these results are not of a comparable value to the SESAM dataset, it gives precious information on past RVF infections, and evidence of on-going RVF virus transmission in 2008 in animals (IgM positive), shortly after the newly imported RVF strain was sequenced from humans. From 2009 onwards, farms were sampled from the CAPAM official registry  [14] . Since Mayotte became a French department in 2011 and part of the EU in 2014, official registration has become compulsory, expanding the official list. The first farmers to register were possibly more affluent (with larger herds), and with an increased awareness of livestock health than those farmers who registered later. The average herd size during the study period was 7.4, and was equal to 9 in the SESAM study only. The official census from 2010 reports an average herd size of 5  [13] , confirming that our sample tended to capture larger than average herds. This could have slightly biased our estimates, since animals in Mayotte are raised outdoors and therefore may share a similar exposure to mosquito bites. In addition, analyses were conducted at the scale of the island. Accounting for a smaller spatial resolution (e.g. administrative communes) would be of limited benefit for an island that is relatively small and that has a similar ecosystem throughout. Finally, in the SESAM dataset, the RVF status of an animal did not influence whether this animal would be resampled in the future. Therefore, the dataset presented is valuable to estimate RVF prevalence in Mayotte through time, especially after 2008. Few animals were sampled in surveys 1-4  (Table 1) , which resulted in large confidence intervals, giving limited knowledge for the period 2004-08 (Phase 1). The absence of age- stratified prevalence also precluded drawing any hypothesis on RVF virus transmission for that period. However, although illegal import of animals was quite common at that time, it is unlikely that all animals found positive were imported; and this supports the hypothesis that the RVF virus had been circulating on the island at least since 2004 (Phase 1), four years before the sequencing of the new virus lineage in 2008. The data in Phase 2 suggest that Mayotte experienced a large RVF epidemic in livestock; but no clinical signs as usually described in animals (abortions, high mortality in young animals) were detected, probably because no formal surveillance system in animals was in place at that time. Indeed, in humans attending the hospital for dengue-like illnesses, RVF virus was detected by RT-PCR in 8 patients between September 2007 and May 2008, confirming the presence of the virus on the island  [7] . Since the implementation of the SESAM surveillance system in livestock in 2009, RVF has been monitored in livestock. There is evidence of new infections (IgM positive or one-year-old animals IgG positive); but the virus has not been detected nor isolated during Phase 3. There is seasonality in rainfall, with very dry months in June-September, and extremely wet months, especially from December to March (average monthly rainfall from 223 to 321mm). In our dataset, however, high IgM prevalences in 2009 with IgM positive animals across the whole island were detected during the dry season. This suggested a large epidemic but does not support a direct correlation between rainfall and new cases. In other ecosystems, such as in the Horn of Africa or Southern Africa, unusually heavy rainfall or an increase in vegetation density were observed from one to six months before the emergence of new RVF cases  [18] [19] [20] [21] . Therefore, it may well be that the heavy rain observed in January-March 2009 prepared suitable conditions for mosquito breeding during the dry season, explaining the high rates of new infections in May-July 2009. In addition, field studies conducted in Mayotte in 2007 showed that natural larvae habitats specifically in rural areas allowed Ae. aegypti to survive the dry season  [22] . Finally, it is also possible that a high number of new infections also occurred during the dry season of 2008 following heavy rains, but unfortunately no IgM testing was done at that time. Very little variation was observed in temperature over the period 2005-15. During the 2010 epidemic in South Africa, temperature above 25°C was the most important risk factor  [23] , and experimental studies in Culex pipiens and Aedes taeniorhynchus, two RVF vector species, showed that temperature above 26°C favoured RVF virus amplification and transmission  [24, 25] . The high average temperatures observed in Mayotte year round may therefore provide almost constantly suitable conditions for RVF virus transmission; and RVF dynamics observed on the island maybe driven mainly by rainfall patterns. There is no information on the virus lineage that circulated in 2004-07. The sequencing of the Mayotte 2008 lineage placed the virus into the East African clade that includes the Kenyan 2006-2007 and Madagascar 2008 lineages  [9, 26] . This suggests that the Mayotte 2008-10 epidemic might have followed, not only heavy rainfall, but also the import of infectious animals with an RVF virus lineage new to the Mayotte ecosystem. Trade of livestock exists from the African mainland and Madagascar, into the Comoros islands and then Mayotte  (Fig 1) , although the latter is illegal  [27] . This import scenario was also supported by the detection of IgM positive goats illegally imported  [10]  from Anjouan  (Fig 1) , between November 2007 and March 2008. Since 2008, no virus has been isolated nor sequenced in animals. The Mayotte 2008 lineage could persist at a low level in livestock or also potentially in wildlife  [1, 6] , causing the latest sporadic new infections in 2014 and 2015. Alternatively, as Mayotte still experiences regular animal illegal imports, introductions of other RVF virus lineages cannot be excluded, such as the Anjouan 2011 lineage detected in a zebu  [28] . The working hypotheses underlying RVF virus re-emergence presented in the introduction are the concomitance of (i) the presence of susceptible livestock, (ii) an increase in vector abundance (e.g. due to heavy rainfall), and (iii) the presence of the virus emerging from local reservoirs or newly introduced. The data presented here suggest that Mayotte currently meets two of the conditions for re-emergence, that are: (i) a high proportion of susceptible livestock that reached about 95% in 2015, and (iii) the presence of the virus, evidenced by the new infections observed in phase 3. Therefore, we hypothesize that with heavy rainfall, such as it was observed in 2008-10, RVF virus could re-emerge. Modelling work was done to assess whether climate pattern could favor RVF virus persistence in Mayotte, which appeared to be true even under very low transmission assumption  [11] . Further modelling work on RVF virus emergence can be implemented accounting for animal imports, wildlife and climate data. Different scenarios of animal imports and rainfall patterns could be tested to explain the observed epidemic dynamics and estimate the likelihood of a future epidemic. Further data collection would therefore be necessary, including ongoing climate data, surveillance in livestock, RVF prevalence in wildlife, RVF data on illegally imported animals, and virus detection, isolation, and sequencing when applicable (S1 Text). In conclusion, this study has shown the value of repeated serological testing to explain RVF population dynamics in this island population despite limited resources. Linking these ongoing studies with additional data and modelling could also shed further light on the origin and reemergence mechanisms of this virus.

 a very high proportion of recently infected animals during that time, with IgM prevalence of 41% (N = 96, n = 39, 95% CI [25-56]) in 2008-09 and 36% (N = 77, n = 28, 95% CI [22-51]) in 2009-10. Finally, IgG prevalence was similar across all age groups in 2008-09 and 2009-10 
 ), presumably those infected in 2007-10. The 2013-14 and 2014-15 seasons suggest a very low intensity of virus transmission. IgG annual prevalence reached its lowest value in 2014-15, 6% (N = 462, n = 29, 95% CI [3-10])

The virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of a mosquito that has previously acquired the virus by blood-feeding on infected birds. The role of mosquito species in the WNV transmission cycle was first demonstrated in the species Aedes albopictus (Skuse) in 1943  [47] . The first isolations from human sera occurred in Egypt and Israel in 1951  [20, 23] . Subsequent events, including the emergence of WNV in North America in 1999, its spread westward across the United States, and then throughout the western hemisphere from South America to Canada, as well as repeated outbreaks in Europe  [11, 12] , suggest that WNV has the largest geographical distribution among the arthropod-borne viruses  [24] . In Africa, WNV is endemic and widely distributed  [45] . In South Africa, the first evidence of WNV infection was observed in 1958  [38] . Since this initial observation, large human epidemics due to changes in environmental conditions resulting in higher mosquito abundance  [62]  and high seroprevalence of WNV infection  [26]  have occurred in South Africa. WNV infections have also been detected in North Africa (Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Senegal)  [4, 9, 49, 52]  as well as in Central Africa (Central African Republic, Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria) and Madagascar  [4, 9, 14, 40, 52, 53] . Based on genetic differences, WNV strains have been classified in eight lineages, with lineages 1 and 2 being described as pathogenic. WNV Lineage 2 strains, which are endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar, were previously considered to be of low pathogenicity  [12, 30] . Mosquitoes of the genus Culex are the primary vectors of WNV in Africa and Asia due to their vector competence and host preferences. There is geographic variation within the genus due to the presence of locally important Culex (Cx.) species such as Cx. pipiens pipiens Linnaeus and Cx. quinquefasciatus Say in Nigeria  [44] ; Cx. univittatus Theobald in Kenya and South Africa; Cx. theileri Theobald in South Africa; and Cx. neavei Theobald, Cx. quinquefasciatus groups, and Cx. poicilipes (Theobald) in Senegal  [3, 14] . In Asia, Cx. quinquefasciatus, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus Giles, and Cx. vishnui Theobald predominate  [25] . Moreover, WNV vertical transmission has already been demonstrated in the field for several species: Cx. univittatus, Cx. salinarius Coquillett, Cx. tarsalis Coquillett, Cx. erythrothorax Dyar, Cx. stigmatosoma Dyar, and Aedes triseriatus (Say)  [13, 39, 41, 42, 61]  and experimentally for several other species: Ae. aegypti Linnaeus, Ae. albopictus, Cx. pipiens, Cx. quinquefasciatus, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, and Cx. modestus Ficalbi  [2, 3, 19, 34] . In Madagascar, virus isolation was first reported in 1978 from an endemic parrot species  [10]  and later from mosquitoes and humans  [16, 17] . Despite serological and virological data demonstrating widespread circulation of WNV across the 18 districts of Madagascar that cover different bioclimatic zones of the country [16,  33, 36, 37, 43] , neither epidemics nor epizootics of WNV have been reported to date. Only one lethal case due to WNV infection has been reported in a traveler returning from Madagascar in 2011  [31] . Among the 235 mosquito species described from the country  [56] , 29 species are widely associated with WNV infection, and they belong to five distinct genera: Aedeomyia (Ad.), Aedes, Anopheles (An.), Culex, and Mansonia  [55] . Of these 29 mosquito species associated with WNV infection, 25 are not native to Madagascar  [55, 56] : 12 species of genus Culex, 6 of Aedes, 4 of Anopheles, 1 of Aedeomyia, 1 of Coquillettidia, 1 of Lutzia, 2 of Mimomyia, and 1 of Mansonia. According to the proposed system of mosquito vector categorization that included natural infection, vector competence, and field vector-host contact, 4 of these 29 mosquito species were considered as major (Culex quinquefasciatus, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Culex univitattus, and Mansonia uniformis (Theobald)), nine as candidate vectors (Aedeomyia madagascarica, Aedes albocephalus (Theobald), Aedes circumluteolus (Theobald), Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, Anopheles coustani Laveran, Culex antennatus (Beker), Culex decens Theobald, and Culex pipiens) and the remaining (16 species) as potential vectors  [55] . There have been few human and animal serological surveys of circulation rates of WNV in Madagascar in recent decades. In 1990, a first serological survey conducted in 12 regions of Madagascar reported a prevalence of 29.9% for anti-WNV antibodies in a non-random sample of 5-20 year-old children or young adults  [43] . A second survey conducted in 1996 in children under 15 years of age in the highlands, and a third in 1999 along the north-western coast of Madagascar detected a 2.1% and 10.6% prevalence of anti-WNV antibodies, respectively  [33] . Finally, in 2012-2013, a serological analysis of chicken sentinels was performed in areas close to lakes where domestic, wild, and migratory birds co-exist with humans and potential mosquito vectors were reported. This study revealed differences in the prevalence of anti-WNV antibodies between the two studied districts (Antsalova 29.4% and Mitsinjo 16.7%)  [36] . These observations are consistent with several possible hypotheses regarding the persistence of enzootic/endemic WNV transmission in Madagascar. The first possibility is that there is a constant potential for contact between WNV vectors and humans due to the persistence of WNV in wild birds, regardless of the urban/rural setting. A second could be that there are alternating cycles in which urban and rural populations of vectors experience peaks in infection intensity separately, with each being the major contributor to WNV transmission at different times. To gain a clearer understanding of the involvement of local mosquito populations as putative competent vectors in WNV transmission in Madagascar, a longitudinal entomological survey was carried out around Lake Kinkony. The lake is the second largest lake in Madagascar  [28] , supporting most of the wetland bird species of western Madagascar  [35]  with a strong vector density and a high WNV antibody prevalence  [5, 36] . Given these conditions, it is an ideal location to understand the relationships between epizootic and putative sylvatic cycles. This preliminary study aims to determine population dynamics of mosquito species, along with their distribution, abundance, and feeding behavior in the WNV endemic context of Madagascar. 
 Materials and methods 
 Study sites In the western region of Madagascar, the district of Mitsinjo was chosen based on three criteria: (i) detection of a high WNV seroprevalence in domestic animals with WNV detection in mosquitoes in 2012, (ii) presence of migratory birds in the same area  [36] , and (iii) ecological features (lake, village, and forest) compatible with WNV transmission between domestic as well as wild wetland and forest birds. Three localities were investigated: Morafeno, Ankelimitondrotra, and Analalava forming an East-West transect across Lake Kinkony  (Fig. 1) . Morafeno, the most easterly village (16°08 0 74.6 00 S, 45°55 0 17.5 00 E), is surrounded by the lake, 100 m from the lakeside with a landscape made of jujube, tamarind dry forest, and food crops. Ankelimitondrotra (16°08 0 86.7 00 S, 45°52 0 97.3 00 E) is located on a peninsula-like projection into the lake. The village is located about 150-200 m from the lakeside with the landscape predominately composed of jujube and tamarind dry forest as well. A large area of swamp and marshland with aquatic plants is observed between Morafeno and Ankelimitondrotra as described by Andriamasimanana and Rabarimanana  [1] . The village of Analalava, the most westerly village (16°08 0 35.7 00 S, 45°42 0 02.5 00 E), is located 1 km from the lakeside with a landscape consisting of jujube, mango, tamarind forest, and savannah dominated by Satrana palm. The average outside temperature is greater than 20°C through the year and can exceed 25°C during the wet season (September to May). The highest rainfall (200 mm-400 mm a year) was observed between January and March, while the lowest rainfall (<15 mm a year) is during the dry season (May and October)  [8] . Fishing is the main occupational activity in Morafeno and Ankelimitondrotra; domestic animals (dogs) and livestock (cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and poultry) are present in all three villages. 
 Longitudinal entomological survey Mosquitoes were sampled every two months from February to December 2014 using CDC-light traps (CDC miniature light trap, BioQuip Products, Inc, Rancho Dominguez, USA) (12 in total) for the determination of mosquito population dynamics and poultry-baited BG sentinel traps (BGS traps) (BioQuip Products, USA) (five to six in total) positioned from 6:00 pm to 5:00 am. A longitudinal serological survey of chickens was performed concurrently. Both mosquito traps were distributed in three distinct ecosystems: forest-village transition zone, within village, and lakeside for one night of capture in each village (four light traps and two BG sentinels per ecosystem). The average distance between each ecosystem is about 100 m, except for Analalava where the distance between village and lakeside is 1 km. In August 2014, BG sentinel traps were not used in the village of Analalava due to security concerns. Each mosquito specimen was morphologically identified by microscopy in the field and in the laboratory on a chilled table, after freezing in liquid nitrogen, based on morphological keys: the unpublished Fontenille key and the Brunhes key  [6] . After identification, insects were pooled (1-10 individuals) per species, sex, and blood-feeding status of female (bloodengorged or not engorged), per trap and per zone. They were stored in liquid nitrogen in the field and stored at À80°C in the laboratory. The host origin of the blood meals of 33 engorged mosquitoes collected in CDC-light traps was determined by the Beier method  [4] . In all, seven vertebrate hosts were tested (human, rat, cow, pig, sheep, chicken, and dog) by a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 
 Screening mosquitoes for West Nile virus The abdomens of 1825 unfed monospecific female mosquitoes were dissected, pooled, and ground up in 350 lL of Minimal Essential (MEM) cell culture medium (Gibco Life Technologies, USA) containing a mixture of 1000 U/mL penicillin, 1 mg/mL streptomycin, and 25 lg/mL amphotericin B (Sigma, USA) with two 3-mm diameter stainless steel beads (Loudet, France) for 30 s using the TissueLyser system (Qiagen, USA). Total RNA was extracted using the NucleoSpin RNA Virus kit (Macherey-Nagel, Germany). For WNV RNA detection, a capsid-based Taqman probe real-time PCR system able to detect WNV lineages 1 and 2 was used with AgPath-ID TM One-Step RT-PCR Reagents (Ambion, Life Technologies, USA) [32] on a 7500 Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA). A lineage 2 positive control was kindly provided by Dr S. Lecollinet (ANSES, France) and included in each of the tests for plate validation. 
 Statistical analysis Data analyses were performed in R version 2.10.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing (http://www. r-project.org), and p 0.05 denoted statistical significance. The mosquito community structure at the different study sites and transects was analyzed using the following approaches: diversity using a Shannon equitability index (H 0 ), and similarity of mosquito fauna using the Jaccard Index of similarity (J), based on the presence/absence of data only. We used the number of mosquito adults caught as the numeric surrogate for analyzing the effect of the types of trap, months, localities, and biotopes with a multi-way ANOVA (analysis of variance).We used Tukey's honest significant difference (HSD) to determine which pairs of means were significantly different. 
 Results 
 Mosquito abundance, species diversity, and trophic preferences A total of 2519 specimens belonging to 21 mosquito species and 6 genera were identified  (Tables 1 and 2 ). At each study site, no significant difference in terms of proportion of  mosquitoes was observed between CDC-light traps and chicken-baited BG sentinel traps  (Table 3 ; df = 1, F = 0.037, p > 0.8). When data from the three villages collected during six separate field samplings in a one-year period were combined, the species accumulation curve tended toward a plateau  (Fig. 4) . Two species of the genus Aedeomyia made up 82.33% of the adult catches. Ten and seven species of Anopheles and Culex genera accounted for 10.32% and 4.00% of the collection, respectively. The remaining, lowfrequency, mosquito species captured (2.54%) consisted of species from the genera Aedes, Mansonia, and Uranotaenia. Greater species richness was found in Analalava (H 0 = 2.94), followed by Morafeno (H 0 = 2.77) and Ankelimitondrotra (H 0 = 2.70). Similarity in species diversity was much higher (J = 0.82) between Morafeno and Ankelimitondrotra than between Morafeno and Analalava (J = 0.75), or between Ankelimitondrotra and Analalava (J = 0.61). Mosquito abundance, driven mainly by the highly abundant species Ad. madagascarica, seemed to be associated with villages that are close to the lake (i.e. Morafeno and Ankelimitondrotra  (Table 3 ; df = 2, F = 4.448, p < 0.01), with higher mosquito density observed in Morafeno (Tukey HSD tests: p < 0.001). Correlation between lakeside biotope and the abundance of mosquito vectors was observed in Morafeno  (Table 3 ; df = 17, F = 17.89, p < 0.001). Post hoc tests showed that this difference is only driven by the differences of Anopheles density between forest and lake (Tukey HSD tests: p < 0.001) and between forest and village (Tukey HSD tests: p < 0.001). No difference in mosquito density was observed for each of the mosquito species between lake and village in Morafeno (Tukey HSD tests: p > 0.05). No significant relationship between biotopes/ecotypes and mosquito abundance was observed in Ankelimitondrotra  (Table 3 ; df = 18, F = 0.848, p > 0.64) and Analalava  (Table 3 ; df = 15, F = 0.00, p = 1). We noted that in Ankelimitondrotra, the forest and lakeside ecosystems are located in close proximity, as the village is surrounded by the lake, while for Analalava, the lakeside biotope is located farther (approximately 1000 m) from the village and forest. The highest and lowest abundance of caught adult mosquitoes was observed, respectively, in the village of Morafeno and the village of Analalava; with a high number of Ad. madagascarica obtained in Morafeno and Ankelimitondrotra  (Table 3 ; df = 20, F = 2.61, p < 0.001). This species made up 81.54% (2054/2519) of the overall  adult catches with light traps, being rare during the rainy season (November to March) and very abundant during the dry season  (Fig. 2) . The total amount of mosquitoes and Ad. madagascarica captured gave the same pattern of monthly variation when data from the three villages were combined  (Fig. 3)    (Table 3 ; df = 45, F = 1.51, p < 0.01). Whereas the peak of abundance of mosquitoes in Ankelimitondrotra was observed in April, the peak in Morafeno occurred in August with a sharp decline afterwards  (Fig. 2) . Of the 33 blood meals analyzed from engorged mosquitoes, 15 (45%) of the total amount could not be identified due to the limits of the technique used. As shown in  Table 4 , most of the identifiable blood meals (11/18) were taken from domestic ruminants (cattle or sheep), six mixed blood meals were from cattle/sheep and one mixed blood meal from chicken/dog.  · shows the effect of interaction between cited factors. * p = 0.05; ** p = 0.01; *** p = 0.001. df = Degrees of freedom; Sum Sq = sum of squares; Mean Sq = mean of squares; F value = value of the F test; Pr (>F) = probability of the F test.  
 Screening mosquitoes for West Nile virus Eight mosquito species that have previously been found infected with WNV in Madagascar were collected during our study. Two of these species (An. maculipalpis and Cx. decens) were not collected in one of the localities (Ankelimitondrotra). When WNV genome detection was performed for a total of 346 abdomen pools representing 1825 mosquitoes (177 pools from Morafeno, 104 pools from Ankelimitondrotra, and 65 pools from Analalava), positive detection was observed in two of the tested pools: one pool of Ad. madagascarica (collected in April 2014) and one pool of An. pauliani (collected in August 2014). Both positive pools came from light traps placed near the lakeside in Morafeno. 
 Discussion The species accumulation curve tending toward a plateau suggests that the number of species caught was approaching the total number of mosquito species in the area. Twenty-one mosquito species were collected in our study, a much larger number than the 14 species described in 2012 in the same area  [5] . However, we did not collect seven mosquito species belonging to the Aedes, Anopheles, and the Culex genera that were collected near the site Morafeno in November 2012  [5] . This observation might be explained by the limitations of our sampling methods using only CDC-light traps and chicken-baited BG sentinel traps, in contrast to  Boyer et al. (2014)  in which other types of traps such as cattle-baited nets and backpack aspirators were used  [5] . Of the eight mosquito species caught in our study area that were previously known to be infected by WNV in Madagascar [16,  36, 55] , four were recently found WNV-positive in villages near lake areas: Ad. madagascarica and An. coustani near Lake Kinkony and An. pauliani and Ma. uniformis near Lake Soamalipo  [36] . In our study, Ad. madagascarica and An. pauliani were the two species found to be positive for WNV. Unfed mosquito abdomens rather than whole specimens were screened for WNV infection. Detecting WNV in the abdomens of unfed mosquitoes suggests the potential for these two species to be involved in the maintenance and/or transmission of WNV in Madagascar. However, to incriminate these species as vectors of WNV transmission, vector competence studies should be undertaken to show infectious virus in the saliva  [18, 48] . CDC-light traps are suitable for studying mosquito seasonal dynamics as evidenced by data obtained in Morocco  [15] , in sub-Saharan Africa  [40] , and in Madagascar  [57, 58] . Interestingly, vector populations were abundant during the dry season with a great abundance of Ad. madagascarica  (Fig. 3) , contrasting with the findings in the central highlands of Madagascar, where WNV mosquito vectors and other arthropod-borne diseases are abundant at the beginning of and during the wet season [16,  57, 58] . Our results would suggest that the abundance of the potential vector Ad. madagascarica is influenced by temperature rather than by rainfall  [51] . In Europe, abundance of WNV mosquito vectors was reported to be driven mostly by artificial flooding for human activities (cultivation, hunting, and fishing) rather than rainfall  [2, 21] . This is the first time that Ad. madagascarica has been trapped in such large numbers in Madagascar, emphasizing its potential role in the WNV endemic cycle around the wetlands of Lake Kinkony. Indeed, species belonging to the genus Aedeomyia were rarely captured with other types of mosquito traps (light or baited traps) in Madagascar  [5, 16, 46, 58] . Despite the lack of information on its larval stage biology, the abundance of this species at our study sites, mainly in Morafeno and Ankelimitondrotra, might be explained by the presence of the large swamp and marshland (with aquatic plants) that are favorable larval sites of the genus Aedeomyia  [6] . Worldwide, there are seven species in the genus Aedeomyia  [6, 22]  with Ad. africana (absent from Madagascar) reported to be involved in the transmission of WNV in Africa  [59] . In Madagascar, three species of the genus Aedeomyia have been collected (Ad. madagascarica, Ad. pauliani, and Ad. furfurea)  [56]  and previous detection of WNV in Ad. madagascarica on the island  [36]  has been confirmed by this study. This endemic species was recently described at adult stages that are morphologically close to those of Ad. africana  [6] . Our results also raise questions as to how An. pauliani intervenes in WNV circulation around Lake Kinkony given its low relative abundance. Indeed, only a small number of this species were previously reported in the western wetlands (Lake Kinkony and Lake Soamalipo) of Madagascar  [5] . However, this species might be an important WNV vector in a different biotope such as the village of Mampikony (district of Mampikony, 200 km east of lake Kinkony) where this species was found to be abundant  [46] . An. pauliani is a general feeder  [56] , but is already considered as a potential vector of WNV due its rarity and to the lack of information on its vector competence  [55] . Our results also support ornithophilic blood-feeding behavior, mainly for Ad. madagascarica in this study, in that chicken-baited BG sentinel traps proved to be very attractive for mosquitoes, thus confirming the use of poultry as an alternative to BG-Lure  [5] . Indeed, BG sentinel traps were designed to collect anthropophilic mosquitoes by using artificial substances (BG-Lure) which are also present on human skin  [29] . This attraction of Ad. madagascarica to poultry is in accordance with blood meal analysis, showing chickens as the blood meal source for this species  (Table 4 ). The use of ELISA for blood meal analysis carries a risk of cross-reactivity but more notably fails to identify many potential hosts, including wild birds, as evidenced by the inability to identify more than 40% of blood meals from engorged mosquitoes. Further analysis using PCR-based methods targeting cytochrome B or cytochrome 1 genes  [27]    would provide confirmation of host blood meal sources. Unfortunately, at the time of the study, the technique was not routinely used in the laboratory. Our findings highlight the ornithophilic behavior already described for the genus Aedeomyia  [6] , and uphold the hypothesis of the involvement of ornithophilic mosquito species in the WNV epidemiological cycle  [2, 7]  and WNV circulation in bird populations in  Madagascar [16, 17, 36] . The ornithophilic feeding preferences of Ad. madagascarica suggest this species might be involved in the maintenance of WNV in the mosquito/bird enzootic cycle, while other mosquito species considered as generalist feeders  (Table 4 ) might serve as bridge vectors between birds and dead-end hosts (mammals) due to the low numbers of bird-to-bird feedings  [60] . Finally, our results suggest that the abundance of mosquitoes around households, mainly Ad. madagascarica, depends on the distance between villages and lakes, suggesting mosquito heterogeneity in accordance with WNV incidence between villages around Lake Kinkony  [36] . Although currently not documented in this study, more intense WNV transmission in villages near lakes would be expected, as highlighted by WNV detection in mosquitoes in Morafeno, given the correlation between lakeside ecotype and the abundance of Ad. madagascarica in this village. However, exposure of this species to a viremic host could not be excluded, given that WNV circulation was recently reported in this area  [36] . For this reason, Ad. madagascarica is considered as a candidate vector of WNV due to the lack of information on its vector competence  [55] . Vector competence studies need to be undertaken to conclude that this species may act as a bridge vector from wild to domestic birds, or vice versa, given that chickens, ducks, and geese are often left wandering during the night, facilitating bird-vector contact at our study sites. To demonstrate the vector competence of this species, the transmission of the virus during the feeding process is required with the determination of the dissemination rate throughout the mosquito body (legs, salivary glands) suggesting virus dissemination and transmission, which are known to depend on temperatures and viral loads  [18, 48, 50 ]. An association with the presence of Ad. madagascarica in areas subject to WNV epizootics and/or epidemics could provide further evidence of its role in transmission. In conclusion, our findings suggest that Aedeomyia madagascarica and Anopheles pauliani are potential vectors involved in the maintenance and/or transmission of WNV in Madagascar. Further work will provide greater knowledge of the host blood meals of these mosquitoes and better characterize the dynamics of WNV in this region, along with determining the WNV vector competence of these two species.

A few major private agro-industries are competing for shares in the new markets, which are often in developing countries and involve the use of dried milk, from the global market and locally produced fresh milk. Dairy mega-farms are being developed, but companies are increasingly in contact with family farms as a sourcing strategy (Nestlé Milk District Model, Danone Ecosystem initiatives, etc.), promoting inclusive businesses  (Kelly et al., 2016) . Milk-sourcing projects are often associated with non-governmental organizations (NGO)  (Gold et al., 2013) . By providing agricultural services to producers' community, companies and NGOs seek to improve the quality and quantity of the raw material collected to meet agroindustrial standards. These projects carry development opportunities and risks. Understanding the general context where they operate appears essential to ensure their sustainability  (Vatin, 2008) . Egypt faces tough challenges. Its population has more than quadrupled in 60 years  (92 million in 2015) . Urban encroachment threatens arable land availability and water resource is scarce. Most milk is produced by family farms, with a peak production in winter. Large and mega dairy farms breeding thousands of cows complete the national production. Yet, Egypt has to import 2 million tons of milk equivalent, increasing the national trade deficit  (Fig. 1 ). In this context, an agro-industrial enterprise has been promoting milk collection centres (MCC) since 2011; an NGO is responsible for developing MCCs within pre-existing farmers organizations supervised by public employees. The project's aim was to collect cow milk from family farms to supply a yogurt processing plant in Greater Cairo and to encourage local development in the regions hosting the MCCs. It has been very active in the Beni Suef (BS) Governorate since 2011 and claimed its key role in milk market development. This paper explores the role of the agro-industry milksourcing project in the evolution of the dairy sector of the BS milkshed. Did the project initiate the creation of a local milk market? Our hypothesis is that MCCs: (i) arrived in an already highly competitive market; (ii) modified milk prices in favour of small suppliers (farmers and milk collectors) and achieved lasting improvements to dairy hygiene. 
 Material and Methods Project promoters intensively invested in the Nile Valley of BS Governorate justifying our choice of investigating the milkshed of this area. The BS milkshed surrounds the city of Beni Suef (120 km south of Cairo)  (Fig. 2)  and follows the Nile Valley borders (excluding desert land and Fayoum Oasis in the west). A literature review helped us to identify relevant data on the BS region: history, demographic trends and changing demands. An in-itinere socio-economic impact study of the project has been conducted during three years (2014-2016) at farms, community and supply chain level. In BS, three villages were selected according to their involvement with the project in 2014 (had an MCC, will receive an MCC and no link with the project). A total of 76 farmers were interviewed, selected according to their milk marketing practices (dealing with MCC or not). 11 dairy collectors and 4 MCC of these villages were also interviewed. They all received a visit every year. Semi-structured interviews were performed to collect data on socio-economic and technical characteristics of these diverse systems. Historical qualitative data were also collected on their dairy activity and the milkshed recent evolution. It will be the main material for this analysis. Participatory meetings were also held in the village with the longest involvement of the project to assess the dairy sector evolution after the MCC opening, including milk hygienic quality evolution. It gathered diverse dairy stakeholders of the village: a milk collector, 2 farmers, a feed trader, 2 MCC employees, a veterinary, an animal trader, and 2 cooperative employees. Additional data were collected via open discussions with key figures involved in the local dairy sector and in the project. Our analysis is consistent with a realistic narrative approach  (Vaara et al., 2016) . By combining these diverse sources, we tried to rebuild the recent evolution of BS milkshed. 
 Results The evolution of BS milkshed is depicted in  Figure 3  and will be detailed in the following paragraphs. 3.1 Before 1980: dairy products marketed on the local market In 1947, the governorate's population was 600,000  (Shousha, 1947)    (Fig. 4) . Its economy was based on  agriculture. BS city was linked to Cairo, but the infrastructure was poor. The majority of the city population were rural migrants, who maintained a rural lifestyle  (Ibrahim and Ibrahim, 2003) . The demographic evolution led to an increase in local demand for homemade processed dairy products, as well as for cow and buffalo milk  (Galal, 2002) . The largest rural population was and remains ""Fellahin"", peasant working in small family farms. They combined integrated crop and livestock production  (Ayrout and Williams, 2005)  on less than 1 ha. Agriculture was subject to State planning and farmers had to plant important areas with cotton. Cereals (maize and wheat), vegetables (tomatoes, onions, etc.) and green fodder (berseem,   maize fodder) were also grown  (Ibrahim and Ibrahim, 2003) . Small herds were kept (one or two cows, one buffalo and a few sheep or goats). Calves were fed on milk. Women used the surplus to make butter or cheese (Karish or Mesh) for home consumption or sale (neighbours or local markets). Buffalo butter or cheese was particularly appreciated. Although several larger farms existed, dairy speculation was absent in the 70 s. Product quality was tested using organoleptic analysis. At that time, the fluid milk market was limited as selling milk was considered a sign of poverty. 
 1980-2000: a ""milkshed centred"" development in the dairy sector During the 1980s, the population increased throughout the BS Governorate and in BS city. Major developments, including the construction of a bridge across the Nile, a highway to Cairo, an extension to BS University and the creation of a new city on the east bank of the Nile (New BS) stimulated local economy. Urban encroachment on arable land and population growth increased farm fragmentation. Between 1980 and 1990, the total number of farmers increased by 12.9 %  (Ayeb, 2010) , mainly among small farms (< 1 ha)  (Robson et al., 2012)  in Egypt. Urban growth and dietary changes increased local demand for dairy products. Several farmers from Zarabi, a village 3 km from BS city, began collecting small volumes of cow milk (< 50 kg/day) in a perimeter of less than 2 to 3 km. The daily round was made on a donkey or bicycle. Milk was sold to cafés in downtown BS. Initially, milk collection provided a supplementary income for farmers. By the end of the 80 s, they became milk collectors, gathering 100-200 kg/day of cow milk, with a farm activity on the side. The arrival of cheap equipment from Asia (motorbikes, tricycles) meant they could extend the collection perimeter (up to 5 km). Subsequently, several milk collectors began renting premises in downtown BS to sell directly to consumers. In the mid-nineties, Zarabi became a dairy cluster in the governorate: 20 families collected 0.5 to 1 t/day of milk from farmers and employed two or three family members. Milk was sold to creameries and a few families started processing milk, using traditional techniques. At the same time, agro-industrial products appeared on the local market in direct competition with artisanal products. Gradually, the taboo regarding liquid milk marketing disappeared, so women could supplement family incomes by selling fresh milk sparing processing time. With the liberalization of the agricultural sector, farmers had more freedom to choose their cropping pattern and increased fodder and dairy production. Taking advantage of the city's proximity, they relied on intermediaries to sell their milk on the urban market. Until then, dairy quality was subject to organoleptic controls. The number of both cows and buffalos increased during this period at the national level. Holstein genetic spread through artificial insemination and resulted in important local genetic losses. Private industrial dairies multiplied in the country encouraged by authorities while informal sector remained neglected. 
 2000 to 2011: structuration and emergence of major local operators In the 90 s, demographic trajectories continued their upward trend: in 2003, the population in Greater Cairo reached 15 million. Dairy products consumption and liquid milk demand increased as well  (EMHP, 2012) . The number of dairies using industrial processes increased in the megalopolis. They produced Roumi (hard cheese similar to Parmesan), White cheeses (fetatype cheeses), Mozzarella, yogurt, etc., collecting several tons of whole and/or skimmed milk, completed with dried milk, on a daily basis. Simultaneously, giant agribusinesses were developing their activity in and around Cairo. In addition to milk powder, their milk supply was guaranteed by their own mega-farms (thousands of dairy cattle) in the New Reclaimed Land (desert land developed for farming through national policies initiated in the 50's and continuing nowadays) and by collecting from  private industrial farms or milk collectors. Although the demand trends provided new opportunities for regional collectors, industrial processes imposed new milk quality standards. In BS, most milk collectors continued to collect from fellahin and sold their products to consumers in milk shops on an increasingly competitive urban market. Few milk collectors' families invested in equipment (coolers, large tanks, pick-ups) to reach Cairo's market. Five larger operators emerged in the BS milkshed, centralizing 1-5 t/day of cow milk (raw and skimmed), collected from farmers and small local milk collectors. It allowed for few speculative dairy farms to appear (20-50 cows, with up to 20 ha) in the governorate. In 2010, milk intermediaries paid 1.5 EGP (Egyptian Pound)/kg (in January 2015, 1 euro equalled 8.57 EGP) for cow milk at the farm gate and sold to urban consumers at 2.2 EGP/kg. With the new industrial quality requirements, large milk traders had to start to use electronic devices to test milk quality. 
 After 2011: agro-industry competing on the local milk market The agro-industry entered the milk collection market in the BS milkshed in 2011, while demographic and urbanization trends continued  (Fig. 4) . Since then, several marketing channels in the region have been co-existing to add value to milk off-farm (  Fig. 5  shows average milk prices and volume for winter 2015): -The traditional local market: women sell their dairy products to neighbours or on the local market. Butter (buffalo milk) was sold to consumers for 35-40 EGP/kg. -The skimmed milk channel: some women own a milk separator (centrifugal device that separates milk into cream and skimmed milk), which they can rent to other woman in the village (average of 3 EGP/animal/week). These milkprocessing houses also give women the opportunity to socialize. After skimming, customers bring back cream and skimmed milk for home processing. Skimmed milk was collected for 1.10-1.20 EGP/kg by dedicated milk collectors. -The whole milk channel (mainly cow milk in BS): small intermediaries collect two times a day, 100-200 kg/day from farms in all the villages in the governorate, using a tricycle and no cooling system (2.48 EGP/kg at farm gate). They can sell some milk to rural consumers (3.5 EGP/kg) during their round or to bigger milk collectors (2.95 EGP/ kg) as well as MCC. Most of the larger milk collectors are from Zarabi, a village that has become a dairy cluster with a regional influence. Its members channel most of the milk  from the milkshed to the city of BS city and the Cairo area. Almost 40 families collect 0.5-2.0 t/day of milk (mainly cow milk) from BS farms (2.48 EGP/kg at farm gate) and other milk collectors. Processing remains a marginal activity for these families. Buffalo milk collection is uncommon in the BS milkshed. It is primarily supplied by milk collectors from the Fayoum milkshed (4.15 EGP/kg). It was sold at 6 EGP/kg to consumers in BS city. In priority, BS milk collectors market their products in their milk shop in BS city (an estimated total of 50 shops). Cow milk was sold at 4.5 EGP/kg and yogurt at 0.65 P/100 g. Surplus is sold to one of the five major collectors in the area connected with agro-industries and cheese laboratories in Cairo (2.95 GP/kg) or to MCC (2.70 GP/kg). The five large collectors test their supply of milk for fat and protein content introducing quality bonuses and penalties. However, the rest of the chain lacks the equipment to test for quality. Almost all milk collectors provide financial services (credit and loans) to their suppliers. Thus they play a key role in agricultural activity and maintain longterm relationship with their suppliers and outlets without formal contracts. -MCC channel: since 2011, MCCs have opened. The main terms of the contract between the agro-industry and agricultural association receiving a new MCC include: the delivery of all the milk collected for a period of 5 years in exchange for the MCC's equipment, agricultural services for suppliers during the initial phase of development (training courses, veterinary services, feed, etc.) focused on woman empowerment, management support and advantageous milk prices when the MCC first opened. The business model is designed to maintain agricultural services by using some of the proceeds from milk sales. The MCC accepts any quantity of milk from its suppliers. Alcohol tests are performed occasionally. Milk composition (and rarely presence of antibiotic residue) is analysed when large quantities of milk are supplied and before each delivery to the plant in the outskirts of Cairo (150-200 km away depending on the MCCs' location). Sales are concluded when the milk delivered meets the company's requirements (quality and quantity). Milk failing to meet requirements is rejected. MCC then have to find alternative marketing channels without bargaining power. When it opened, the MCC was very attractive to farmers and local milk collectors. Its direct link with a major multinational company suggested increased security and new perspectives. In 2012, this company offered an average of 2.70 GP/ kg to MCC. The recommended margin was set at 0.25-0.30 EGP. Thus, the estimated MCC price was 2.40 GP/kg for suppliers (farmers and milk collectors) compared to milk collectors who paid 1.5 EGP/kg the previous year. In 2012, MCC received an average of 4 t/day. Local milk intermediaries resisted by increasing their prices. Thus, milk prices for farmers increased and the volume collected by MCC decreased. In 2014, the average volume collected decreased from 4 t/day to 2.5 t/day as five MCCs collected milk regularly in the BS area. MCC offered an average price of 2.70 EGP/kg in the winter of 2015. The conventional milk collectors offered lower prices (2.48 EGP/kg), but had lower quality requirements and collected at home. Milk hygienic quality evolution in the village was assessed during participatory meetings. According to this group, by introducing new milk quality requirements and offering courses, the MCC helped farmers improving their production practices. Based on their perception, the milk hygienic quality improvement was scored to 30% in the village. Families adjusted their practices to benefit from the MCC's high initial prices. Regardless their marketing channels, they kept the new practices to protect their families' health. The standards enforced by independent traders also contributed to this evolution. However, the company regularly rejected MCC milk for quality reasons. Subsequently, milk was sold to other businesses below cost price, which undermined the MCC's economic balance. Consequently, when the company stopped providing financial support, the MCC found it difficult to maintain agricultural services for farmers. Over the years, the MCC collected smaller quantities  (Fig. 5) . 
 Discussion-Conclusion Demographic growth and diets evolution led to an increase in the demand for dairy products. It also generated the bottomup structuration of the Beni Suef (BS) dairy sector, which was made possible by more liberal policies and improved infrastructure. The evolution of the BS milkshed until the 90 s is comparable to the Brasil Novo milkshed, in Brazil  (Poccard-Chapuis and Carvalho, 2015)  where local urban demand and know-how facilitated the organization of the dairy sector within the milkshed. This evolution has not been observed in Ethiopia, where the increasing urban demand did not lead to the local dairy sector structuration  (Geleti et al., 2014) . After the 90's, the opening up of the BS milkshed strengthened the dairy sector structuration. Few operators were able to reach the demands of cheese-processing units and agroindustrial in Greater Cairo. Meanwhile industrial dairy products entered BS market. This validates the first hypothesis: a dynamic dairy activity had developed in the BS milkshed before the agro-industry began to collect milk locally. In 2011, when milk collection centers (MCC) arrived, a new sequence started. Similar to the cases in Turkey, MCCs could be conceived as proximity operators that stimulated the dairy network locally and created a new ""bridge"" between producers and agribusiness  (Sayin et al., 2011) . The MCCs generated positive competition in BS. They stimulated a rise in milk prices and improved local milk quality. Farmers and small local collectors could diversify their marketing channels, increasing their resilience. Interesting research perspectives would be to consider the impact of this evolution on the access to dairy products for the poorest segment of the population which might have been hindered. Large traditional collectors were quick to respond to the new competition and the MCCs faced difficulties. Meeting the agro-industrial quality and quantity requirements regularly remains difficult for MCCs. It undermines their economic stability. As in the case of Morocco  (Faysse and Simon, 2015) , the MCCs' strategy to improve milk quality was limited to farmers delivering directly their milk (without intermediary). Encompassing all the actors of the local value chain in a management that would focus on both improving milk quality of MCC suppliers (farmers and milk intermediaries) and dealing with milk quality heterogeneity, by relying on the local value chain, might be a more efficient strategy. This last sequence can be considered in the light of two cases from Senegal. In 1992, Nestlé tried to develop a local milk collection system. It faced problems similar to those seen in the model currently promoted in Egypt: high transport costs, milk quality issues and fairly unattractive prices offered by agro-industries compared to the local market. The company withdrew its activity after 10 years  (Vatin, 2008) . On the contrary, La Laiterie du Berger is a successful dairy in Senegal. Local milk collection and milk powder are processed into high quality value-added dairy products for urban consumers. An agro-industrial group has recently invested in the enterprise  (Corniaux, 2015) . La Laiterie du Berger raises the question of the possibility for a MCC to diversify sources of income by taking advantage of nearby urban markets while continuing to supply raw milk to the agro-industry. Diversifying MCCs activities by processing and diversifying marketing channels would help overcome the problem of milk heterogeneity and might improve financial stability. Gender dimension was a corner stone of the MCC project. It provided to woman employment, trainings and opportunity to market raw milk (reducing processing time). As in the Bengali case study, the role of women may have been strengthened by the MCCs projects  (Quisumbing et al., 2013) . Paradoxically, it also competed with traditional businesswomen (those with a separator or who sell cheeses in the market). Several development pathways can be considered for the future development of the BS milkshed. Population growth and changing diets will continue to drive demand. It will create new market opportunities for businesses and agro-industries will continue to invest in their search for new milk sources. Fellahin are likely to remain the main milk producers in Egypt for years to come. They will continue to raise agro-industrial interest. The sustainability of the top-down models currently promoted is uncertain in the short term, given their precarious economic situation. As long as agro-industry enterprises do not offer incentives competing with the informal chain, attempts to secure their milk supply will remain precarious. In order to develop adapted business strategies, a deeper acknowledgement of the local contexts is essential. Adjusting these initiatives in a process of co-construction with local milk collectors seems to be a pathway to explore. MCC could benefit their social anchorage, as well as their knowledge of the region  (Kelly et al., 2016) . Diversifying marketing channels by relying partially on them is a key for MCC to deal with milk quality heterogeneity and thus become more profitable. Furthermore, in a context where consumer's expectations regarding quality are increasing and a new food law is under preparation, MCCs involvement towards diverse dairy actor's hygienic practices could constitute an added synergy between public decision makers, project managers and micro-enterprises from the informal market. More generally, competition for land use and water scarcity calls into question the future of agriculture and dairy sector in BS. The escalating cost of feed (fodder and concentrates) is already problematic for dairy production. If agro-industry plans to maintain its family farm supply, optimizing efficiency of local resources use and limiting tensions by promoting inclusive coordination mechanisms is a pathway. Interbranch organizations dedicated to build inclusive value chains, rather than integrated, could help to progress towards values creation benefiting both the investing company as well as the local stakeholders. Ultimately they could contribute to the advent of a more sustainable territory. Fig. 1 . 1 National dairy production and imports in relation to demographic growth in Egypt from 1961 to 2012.Fig. 1.

Straw is sometimes used as a synonym for stover, which is the stalks and leaves of larger cereal plants such as maize (maize stover), sorghum (sorghum stover) and pearl millet. Sunflower stalks are also called straw or stover. Unlike small cereal straws, stover may be relatively fresh. Maize, sorghum and millet stovers are major forages in developing countries. Maize stover is also widely used in commercial agriculture. Straw is often a synonym for the haulms and vines of legume crops  (pea, common bean, lentil, cowpea...) , oil crops (rape, groundnut, soybean...), root crops (potatoes) or textile crops (flax). Legume straws are much more difficult to recover: in humid climates the leaves tend to discolour or drop at, or before, harvest, and in dry conditions they shatter. Where the final drying of the crop takes place at the homestead, it is easier to recover the leaves and stems. It should be noted that the term straw used for other crops than small cereals can be a source of confusion. Essentially, straw, stricto sensu, is dry and does not usually include residual grains and chaff (very small pieces of straws mixed with grain husks and weed seeds). However, straws from legumes and other plants may be significantly moist and include other plant residues. In livestock feeding, straws of all types are coarse, high-fibre, low-protein and low-digestibility roughages. They play an important role as fillers and they have some value as an energy source for feeding ruminants and pigs provided that they are adequately supplemented. In dry climates, well-harvested, stored and processed straws may have a nutritive value similar and in some cases better than dried, mature tropical grasses. In temperate areas, straws can be emergency feeds in periods of drought  (Suttie, 2000) . While straws are typically of low nutritive value, their quality is variable and depends on species and variety. Legume straws generally have a higher nutritive value than cereal straw due to their higher protein content  (Suttie, 2000) . Soil fertility, rainfall, time of sowing, time of harvest and storage conditions also influence straw quality  (Aitchison, 2005) . Oat straw is considered to be more palatable than the straws of other cereals due to the absence of awns  (Kruse, 2003; Warren, 2004) . This datasheet is mostly concerned with straws of small cereals from temperate countries (wheat, barley, oat, rye and triticale), since these straws are largely comparable from a nutritional point of view. However, processes that increase the nutritional value of straws tend to be common to most high-fibre roughages. Straws from tropical and subtropical cereals, stovers, legume straws and other crop residues are described in the datasheets of the corresponding plant forages, but comparisons between small cereal straws and other straws are discussed below. 
 Distribution Straws are available wherever cereal or legume grain production occurs. Assuming that cereal straw production is slightly higher than the corresponding grain production, it can be estimated that 2 to 3 billion tons of straw were produced in the world in 2007  (FAO, 2011) . 
 Processes Straws are low quality roughages and there have been many attempts to improve their nutritive value through physical or chemical treatments. 
 Physical processes Straws can be treated by grinding, soaking, boiling and fermenting. Grinding (also called chaffing or chopping) is the preferred method as other methods generally give poor results. In India, chopping straws and stovers reduced fodder wastage by 30% as animals could not select between leafy parts and dry stems  (Chander, 2010a) . 
 Chemical processes Treating straw with chemicals can give a product of higher nutritive value, particularly when the untreated product is of very low nutritive value. The nutritional improvement depends on the plant family, species and variety: notably, legumes straws are less responsive to chemical treatments than cereal straws  (Chenost et al., 1997) . Chemical treatments are primarily designed to facilitate the attack of lignified cell walls by rumen micro-organisms: alkali treatments break lignin-carbohydrate linkages, resulting in the solubilization of lignin associated with polysaccharides and in the breaking of cellulose into smaller units. The treated straw is thus looser and easier to digest  (Ramalho-Ribeiro, 1994) . Most chemical treatments are alkali treatments: sodium hydroxide (NaOH), ammonia (NH 3 ) and urea. These methods tend to require large amounts of water and are therefore impracticable in areas where water supply is limited  (Suttie, 2000; Chenost et al., 1997) . Treatment with HCl has also been successfully tested on straw to be fed to sows  (Gärsch et al., 1989) . 
 Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) treatment 
 Wet treatment The process consists in soaking the straw in 10 times its weight of a 1.3% NaOH solution at ambient temperature for about 24 hours. The liquid is drained off to be used for another batch of straw. An average of 7-8 kg of NaOH is required for 100 kg of straw. The straw is washed after treatment until it is free of alkali. Attempts have been made to reduce the amount of water required for the process, for example mixing 100 kg of straw with only 300 L of water and 6 kg of NaOH. After treatment, straw is washed according to the principle of chromatography (countercurrent), whereby the stream of water meets the flow of straw: this treatment has a tremendous effect on crude fibre digestibility. If higher costs for chemicals are acceptable, the alkali can be neutralized with acetic acid rather than washed out. However, the high level of sodium in such materials may cause problems if fed in large amounts. Neutralization through ensiling also seems promising  (Suttie, 2000) . 
 Dry treatment Another approach is to spray low concentrations of alkali on the feed (4 kg of NaOH per 160 kg of chopped straw) and to allow it to slake before feeding. The sprayed straw is pelleted so that the alkali comes in close contact with the fibre. The pellets are not neutralized before feeding. Another method consists in treating the straw for fifteen minutes in a hot (80-90°C) NaOH solution. The liquid is then pressed out of the treated straw before it is dried in a grass drier. The acid hot gases (carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide) in the dryer neutralize the straw  (Suttie, 2000) . Though NaOH treatment increases cell wall digestibility, it may be dangerous for the operators and it has no effect on nitrogen content  (Ramalho-Ribeiro, 1994 ). 
 Ammonia (NH 3 ) and urea treatment Ammonia treatment increases the digestibility of straw with the additional benefit of enriching it with nitrogen. Ammonia also acts as a fungicide as the process creates anaerobic conditions. Anhydrous ammonia or a 35% aqueous solution can be used when water is available. Gaseous ammonia is best suited to large operations but can only be used where the distribution system for ammonia (tankers, cylinders) is available  (Suttie, 2000) . In a simple farm-scale application, the straw is baled loosely and placed on a plastic sheet, after which the straw is tightly and hermetically covered with plastic, and gaseous ammonia (3-4% of the weight of the straw) is let in through a hose. The straw can be used after 3 to 8 weeks, depending on temperature conditions (the lower the temperature, the longer the process), when the plastic is removed and the ammonia aired off. Ammonia treatment requires good moisture conditions (the straw moisture must range between 15 and 40%) which are not always easy to fulfil in drier areas. The ammonia treatment requires that providers of gaseous or anhydrous ammonia are available, which is not always the case  (Chenost et al., 1997) . While developed countries use the direct ammoniation process for treating straw, treatment with urea has been proposed since the 1980s as a cheaper and safer alternative to NH 3 and NaOH treatment in tropical countries  (Walli, 2010; Chenost et al., 1997) . Urea mixed with moist straw releases ammonia throughout the following reaction: CO (NH 2 ) 2 + H 2 O → 2 NH 3 + CO 2 Facilitated by bacterial action, the process is rapid at high temperatures and is thus more suited to subtropical and tropical conditions than to temperate climates or subtropical winters. Because it releases ammonia, urea treatment has a similar effect on straw as anhydrous ammonia  (Suttie, 2000) . Depending on environmental conditions and especially temperature, ureatreated straws can be used between 2 weeks after treatment in dry tropical regions or on humid plains, and 3-5 weeks at higher altitudes in tropical areas where night temperatures can drop considerably  (Ramalho-Ribeiro, 1994) . Urea treatment should be timed to fit in with crop-harvesting operations and wherever possible done before the straw or stover has already been stored or stacked, to avoid double handling and extra labour. This will also help ensuring that the straw is in good condition; dirty, mouldy or rotten straw must never be treated as the end-product would be a poor and potentially dangerous feed  (Suttie, 2000) . However, though urea treatment was ""hugely extolled"" as the most promising treatment for small-scale farms in tropical areas  (Chander, 2010b) , a 2010 report by the FAO showed that this technology could be considered a failure due to its poor adoption by farmers, except in China. Many reasons have been suggested among which the cost of urea, the time (and subsequent labour costs) needed and the insufficient water supply were the most important. Reducing labour requirements through the mechanical spraying of straw during harvest, or through the establishment of straw treatment cooperatives, might improve its adoption by a wider range of small farmers. The use of urine as cheap urea source was also proposed as a possible incentive factor for farmers  (Owen et al., 2010) . 
 Other chemical treatments Sulphur dioxide, ozone and alkaline hydrogen peroxide are other possible chemical treatments. Sulphur dioxide and ozone treatments had a positive effect on rape straw degradability  (Alexander et al., 1987) . 
 Biological treatments Many experiments have been done in order to increase the degradability of ligno-cellulosic material by the way of ligninolytic fungi or enzyme treatments. In wheat and rice straws, fungi such as Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus awamori, Trichoderma reesei, Trichoderma viride and Phanerochaete chrysosporium have yielded higher levels of reducing sugars than chemical treatments  (Patel et al., 2009) . Such methods could be a practical, environmental-friendly and cost-effective future approach for enhancing the nutritive value of straws  (Sarnklong et al., 2010).  drilling management Harvesting It is generally preferable to store straw as much as necessary to cover the roughage needs of livestock through the lean season. Straw yield, recovery and quality can be improved without changing cultivars by attention to agronomic details at the time of harvest and immediately afterwards. Where the whole crop is cut at harvest, the straw should be dried as quickly and thoroughly as possible, and stored with care. Where heads or cobs are hand-gathered, the cutting and drying of the stover or straw should be done immediately after grain harvest is completed, with the fields protected from grazing livestock in the period between grain harvest and straw collection. Stooking of maize and sorghum allows final ripening of the grain after the plant is cut. This provides stover of better feeding value than if the crop is allowed to mature standing  (Suttie, 2000) . 
 Traditional harvesting method In developing countries, straw is hand-cut a few days before full maturity to prevent shattering. It is then bound into sheaves that are let to ripen and dry in the field. The sheaves are threshened and yield grain and straw. The form of straw depends on the threshing method. Threshing by flails or by mechanical threshers produces long straw. Treading by animals (horses or draught oxen) or with a ridged roller breaks straw into 5-10 cm long pieces. Straws can be chaffed during threshing, resulting in short straw pieces. After threshing, straw often remains unbaled. It can be stored in the field on the ground where it can be covered with mud or plastic sheeting to protect it from rain and livestock, or stored in trees or on roof tops so that livestock cannot reach it. Mud covering can be used to seal stacks for urea treatment  (Suttie, 2000) . In small-scale farm systems, maize, sorghum and millet stover is usually handled and dried in the long, unchopped state, often by stooking (sheaf bundling) in, or on the boundary of the field prior to storage. Where dried roughage is highly valued and there is a dry season after harvest, stovers are usually dried in sheaves. In dry areas they are often stored by stacking the sheaves together with the stems more or less vertical. In large-scale systems stover may be baled, but it can also be collected by forage-harvester and ensiled with or without urea treatment  (Suttie, 2000) . 
 Mechanized harvesting method In industrialized countries, fully mature cereals are harvested with combine-harvesters. Straws are thus of lower value as the leaves are drier and the nutritive value drops with maturity. Moreover, herbicides suppress weeds which can increase the nutritive value of the straw  (Suttie, 2000) . Straws are generally baled in square or round bales of variable size and weight. The chaff is removed from the straw and used as bedding material or as feed. Removing chaff from the field and feeding it to livestock is a conservation method as it allows no-till methods by removing weed seeds  (Carton, 2009  common in small-scale farm systems for rice, maize, pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), finger millet (Eleusine coracana) and sorghum. Where feed is plentiful or where labour is scarce, this stubble may be grazed directly by livestock, which is advantageous since stubble may have a higher nutritional value due to the presence of unharvested grains and weeds. Animals graze it selectively and may find a maintenance diet from what might be a sub-maintenance feed if taken as a whole. However, this technique causes a lot of wastage through trampling and is not advisable where there is an overall shortage of roughage for the dry season or winter  (Suttie, 2000) . Stovers are still grazed in some countries, especially in parts of Africa. This is wasteful but does save a lot on labour and returns some organic matter to the fields  (Suttie, 2000) . 
 Environmental impact Environmental services The use of straw for numerous agricultural and non-agricultural activities of straw makes it one of the foremost and most ancient multi-purposes agricultural by-product. Vast quantities of biomass and energy are recycled through the use of straw for feed, fuel and fertilizer. Environmental and health issues with straw treatments 
 Health hazards Chemical treatments of straws may have deleterious impacts on health and the environment. Alkali treatments may be potentially dangerous for operators as they may cause eye and skin burns when not properly used  (Ramalho-Ribeiro, 1994) . 
 Water contamination When straws are treated with urea, the necessary high moisture content of the final product (more than 30%) requires the addition of large amounts of water at the beginning of the process. Because NH 3 is hygroscopic and remains in water, and because straw does not retain high levels of water, urea treatment can result in NH 3 leaching from the bottom of the silo (Ramalho-Ribeiro, 1994).  
 Nutritional attributes Straws are rich in fibre and poor in nutrients including protein, sugars, minerals and vitamins. Straws from cereals and grasses (Poaceae) are generally of lower nutritional value than straws from other plant families. The leaf:stem ratio as affected by harvesting conditions may determine to a great extent the nutritive value of straw, especially for legume species, and leaf loss should be prevented if the straw is going to be used as an animal feed . The following table shows the average (and range) protein and fibre content of straws from cereals and legumes (Feedipedia, 2013): 
 Type of straws Cereals and grasses Vegetables Crude protein % DM 4. The composition of straws depends on the species and, like other crop residues, on the proportions of stems, leaves and other material such as soil. Cereal and grass straw contains about 4% DM protein vs. about 10% for legume straws. The crude fibre and ADF levels are roughly similar (35-40% DM) but cereal straws tend do be much richer in NDF (about 74% DM) than legume straws (about 54% DM). The latter, however, are more lignified (10% lignin vs. 6.5% DM for cereal straw). Straws are poor in sugars and starch (less than 2% for wheat straw). Temperate cereal straws (wheat, barley, oats) tend to have relatively low levels of mineral matter (5-7% DM) but other cereal species, like rice, are rich in minerals (18% DM). Oat and barley straw are generally considered to be more nutritious and palatable than wheat straw. In western Europe, untreated wheat straw is considered to be very poor, and not fed except in an emergency. In the UK, oat and barley straw were the only ones recommended as feed until modern straw-treatment techniques were introduced. In the traditional wheat-growing countries of Asia and North Africa, however, wheat straw is highly prized and great care is taken in collecting and storing it. The straw of foxtail millet (Setaria italica), which is an important crop in north-western China, is well accepted by livestock. In India and Nepal, finger millet straw (Eleusine coracana) is considered a good feed. The straw of common millet (Panicum miliaceum) is hairy and its palatability is mediocre  (Suttie, 2000) . 
 Potential constraints Toxicity of urea and ammonia-treated straws Treating straw with urea or ammonia can cause toxicity in ruminants. Large amounts of urea entering the rumen may result in the production of excess NH 3 by the rumen bacteria. Part of this ammonia cannot be fully detoxified by the liver and passes into the blood stream, causing ataxia (at 29 mg/L blood in cattle) or death (at 42 mg/L in cattle and 32 mg/L in sheep)  (Rogers, 1999) . It is thus important that livestock is progressively introduced to treated straws so that rumen bacteria can adapt to the increased levels of urea, thus preventing the sudden release of NH 3 in the rumen  (Suttie, 2000; Rogers, 1999) . 
 Other concerns Concerns about straws tend to be specific. For instance, some straws (wheat, barley) contain awns that may lower their palatability. Some legumes, like faba bean (Vicia faba) have coarse, woody stems  (Suttie, 2000) . The high fibre content of oat straw is known to cause digestive and bowel occlusions (phytobezoars) in horses  (Kohnke et al., 1999) . The straw of chickpea (Cicer arietinum) has a very high oxalic acid content, is unpalatable, and reputed to be toxic  (Suttie, 2000) . 
 ruminants Straws are generally bulky and the feeding value of untreated straws for ruminants is rather low: the OM digestibility of straws is in the 42-54% range. Their ingestibility is low: it is higher for sorghum, faba bean, pea and grasses than for rice, wheat, barley and oat  (INRA, 2007) . The nutritive values of legume straws are intermediate between those of medium-quality hays and those of cereal straws . Large differences in degradation can be observed within the same species, as reported for barley straw  (Capper et al., 1992)  and rice straw  (Vadiveloo, 1992; Abou-El-Enin et al., 1999; Agbagla-Dohnani et al., 2001) . In ruminants, oat straw is more palatable than barley straw, while barley straw is more palatable than wheat straw  (Hamilton, 2010) . However, despite their poor feeding value, straws can be useful during dry periods when high quality forages are lacking. Straws must be harvested well dried, and stored in a dry place. Straw digestibility is limited both by its lignification and by its low nitrogen content. The digestibility and the rate of rumen passage can be increased by supplementing the straw with protein concentrate or urea plus minerals. It may also be economical to increase the nutritive value of straws by physical or chemical treatments  (Göhl, 1982) . Effect of treatments on intake and digestibility The feeding value of straw can be improved by grinding or by treatment with alkalis such as NaOH and ammonia. Grinding improves the ingestibility of straws, but not its energy or nitrogen value. Grinding also deprives the animal of the opportunity to reject the fibrous parts, thus reducing the digestibility of the feed, although this disadvantage is usually counterbalanced by the higher voluntary feed intake. For example, grinding wheat straw, even rather coarsely, can result in a 20-30% increase in intake because of the faster rate of passage through the rumen  (Göhl, 1982  Such increases in digestible energy intake can result in much greater performance. For instance, there have been reports of a 50% increase in the daily gains of beef cattle fed on all-roughage diets. It should be noted that the increased intake of digestible energy raises the protein requirement as well. When ground forage is mixed with concentrates, grinding tends to eliminate the difference in forage quality  (Göhl, 1982) . 
 NaOH treatment NaOH treatment can increase the organic matter digestibility of wheat straw from 46% to more than 70%. Chromatographically treated wheat straw has a crude fibre digestibility of about 90%. An additional benefit is that straw treated with NaOH becomes softer, so less energy is lost in chewing and digestion. NaOH-treated straw is palatable and can be consumed in large quantities by livestock. Beef cattle can be fed up to 20 kg of treated straw per day, dairy cows up to 15 kg, young heifers up to 10 kg and sheep up to 3 kg. However, as noted previously, NaOH treatment is expensive and dangerous and does not improve the nitrogen value of the straw  (Göhl, 1982) . 
 Ammonia or urea treatment Ammonia treatment (by the addition of anhydrous NH 3 or urea) is easier to do in practice than NaOH treatment, and more valuable since it improves ingestibility, digestibility and nitrogen content  (Baumont, 2011) . In sheep, the increase in voluntary intake induced by NH 3 -treatment is on average + 5 g/kg BW in sheep. In cattle, data are scarce but are of the same order of magnitude (+ 1.8 kg/d for steers and heifers;  Baumont, 2011) . This is far from being negligible given the low ingestibility of untreated straws (e.g. 11-12 g/kg BW in sheep and heifers for a barley straw;  Dulphy et al., 1994) . The increase in OM digestibility is on average 10-12 percentage points for wheat, barley, sorghum and maize, but is lower for rice (on average 4 points), which is initially more digestible. The increase in digestibility of crude protein is on average 6.2-6.5%, and an extra 14-20 g/kg DM of PDIN (true protein absorbable in the small intestine when N is limiting in the rumen) for wheat, barley and rice straws. For sorghum, crude protein digestibility is increased by 9.6%, with an extra 38 g/kg DM of PDIE (true protein absorbable in the small intestine when energy is limiting in the rumen). Ammonia-treated straws have an energy value and ingestibility comparable to that of late cut grass hays, but their nitrogen value remains lower  (INRA, 2007; Baumont, 2011 ). 
 Supplementation Straw is generally combined with other forages such as hay or silage, but it can be used as sole forage with supplementation where more nutritive forages are scarce. The first objective of supplementation is to meet the requirements of the rumen microbes in order to improve straw digestibility. Soluble nitrogen and fermentable carbohydrates can be provided by liquid feeds (such as a molasses-urea mixture included at 5-10% by weight of straw), protein concentrate (100 g of soybean meal or 150 g rapeseed meal per kg straw), by-products (corn gluten feed, DDGS and other maize processing by-products, rice bran), or legume forages such as leucaena leaves (Leucaena leucocephala). Minerals, trace elements and vitamins must also be provided. The second objective is to meet the energy and nitrogen requirements of the animal without affecting the cellulolytic activity of rumen microbes. Cracking or coarsely grinding cereal grains must be preferred to fine grinding in order to avoid an excess of rapidly fermentable carbohydrates. When a high level of concentrates is required, fibrous concentrates such as beet pulp, bran or corn gluten feed can be used  (Devun et al., 2011) . Straw can be the main forage for heifers older than 15 months, and for suckling cows before the 8 th month of pregnancy, provided that their body condition score is sufficient. For younger heifers and for early calving suckling cows or animals with a low body condition score, other forages must be offered with the straw. For dairy cows and fattening steers, straw is mainly used to meet appetite and to ensure adequate rumen function as well as a fractioned distribution of concentrate among the day. Straw must be offered as long particles, ad libitum and several times per day  (Devun et al., 2011) . Urea-treated rice straw is sometimes used as roughage for milking cows in dairy farms (e.g. in Northern Thailand) but requires a true protein supplement  (Sruamsiri, 2007) . In fattening lambs, straws can result in a performance similar to that obtained with hay. Ewes have a limited intake capacity and at least 500 g/d of good quality hay must be given with the straw (1-1.5 kg/d) from late pregnancy to early lactation  (Devun et al., 2011) . 
 Specific information on straws For detailed information on the use of specific straws in ruminants, see the datasheets for those species in Related feeds on the ""Description"" tab. 
 Pigs Straws are a highly fibrous and nutrient-poor material and thus only have a limited use in pig nutrition. However, they are used in pig farming both as a foraging substrate for behavioural purposes and/or as a feed for diluting dietary energy. 
 Sows Supplying pregnant sows with straw was found to be effective in preventing bar and chain manipulations and in reducing stereotypic behaviour  (Stewart et al., 2011; Veum et al., 2009; Whittaker et al., 1998; Spoolder et al., 1995  In lactating sows, untreated ground straw had a reducing effect on milk production as excessive straw consumption reduced energy intake  (Kempen et al., 1977) . This dilution of dietary energy was found to be useful in pregnant sows, as it prevents them being overweight at farrowing, which can be deleterious to piglet survival  (Dourmad et al., 1994) . Including straw in the diet resulted in higher or unchanged sow performance, litter size and litter weight at birth and weaning  (Veum et al., 2009; Guillemet et al., 2007; Gärsch et al., 1989) . The effects of a high fibre diet on duration of parturition are debated. This duration was reduced in sows fed a 7% straw diet  (Morgenthum et al., 1988) . In sows kept at low temperatures, wheat straw included at 22% together with wheat grain or dehydrated alfalfa meal reduced methane emissions and resulted in increased extra heat production  (Noblet et al., 1988) . 
 Growing and fattening pigs Straw has a negative effect on digestibility and energy availability in growing pigs. For instance, in animals fed up to 30% barley straw in the diet, an increase in crude fibre from barley straw by 1% depressed the digestibility of gross energy by 2.9% (2.1 percentage points) and depressed the efficiency of utilization of metabolizable energy by 1.0% (0.7 percentage points)  (Just, 1982) . In fattening pigs, dilution of dietary energy can be used to limit fatness during the second stage of fattening when ad libitum feeding may result in the pigs being overweight. The inclusion of 10-15% wheat straw for fattening pigs was found to decrease the digestibility of protein, NDF, hemicellulose and gross energy  (Falkowska et al., 2006) , and to negatively affect daily gain and feed conversion ratio  (Kozera et al., 2006) . These results are partly consistent with former results that indicated that straw inclusion (8 or 16%) decreased intake of metabolizable energy and fat retention but that animal performance depended on the sex of animals (unchanged performance and lean tissue growth rate in castrated male pigs but slightly decreased performance in females)  (Hakansson et al., 2000) . 
 Poultry In regions where straw is available at low cost, it is often used as a bedding material in poultry sheds. Straws have no value for poultry feeding: due to their high fibre content, they provide no energy or usable nutrients. In some conditions, straw can help to increase the proportion of fibre in diets of layers or male breeders  (Hetland et al., 2004; de Jong et al., 2005) . It can be practical to use finely ground straw as a filler for low energy diets, although the same effect could be obtained by selecting a higher proportion of fibre-rich ingredients through feed formulation. 
 Horses and donkeys Straw from cereal grains can be fed to horses almost exclusively as a fibre source and can be used to replace all of the hay if the diet is properly supplemented with protein and minerals: for example, free-choice straw supplemented 2.2 to 3.2 kg of a 16% protein grain mix or 2.2 to 3.2 kg of alfalfa  (Warren, 2004) . However, straw is best used to replace only a portion of the hay and is a way to bypass buying additional hay when feeding a horse with high energy needs  (Warren, 2004; Kruse, 2003) . When feeding straw, water should be made available to reduce the risk of impaction colic. Straw should be gradually introduced in the diet over two weeks to give the horse's digestive system time to adjust to the fibre.

The culms are fine, erect, simple or sparsely branched, prone to lodging. The root system is shallow and fibrous. Tef is a leafy species. Its leaves are glabrous, linear, 25-45 cm long x 0.1-0.5 cm wide. The seed head is a long panicle, 10-65 cm long, bearing 10-40 slender racemes which may be either very loose or very compact. Panicles bear 30-1100 spikelets. Fruits are ellipsoid, minute (1-1.5 mm x 0.5-1 mm), yellowish-white to deep brown caryopsis (grain)  (Tefera et al., 2006; Seyfu Ketema, 1997) . Tef is possibly the smallest cereal grain with an average length of about 1 mm. The average thousand kernel weight of 12 teff varieties was 0.264 g (Geremew . The word ""tef"" is connected by folk etymology to the Ethio-Semitic root ""ṭff"", which means ""lost"" (because of the small size of the grain). 
 Uses Tef grain is a staple food in Ethiopia. It has a high nutritive value and is used to prepare several dishes, the main one being injera, a popular fermented and flattened sour bread  (Tefera et al., 2006) . Tef grain is one of the cereal grains used in the production of Ethiopian beer (tela). Due to the minuteness of tef grains, they are difficult to decorticate, and the cereal is consumed as a wholegrain  (Baye, 2015) . There are many varieties of tef. The Hagaiz type has white seeds, matures slowly (150 days), makes higher demand on soil and cannot be grown above an altitude of 2500 m. The Tseddia type has brown seeds, matures early (90 days), can be grown above 2500 m and is superior for fodder production  (NRC, 1996) . Three major categories exist on the market: white (nech), red (quey) and mixed (sergegna). Wholesalers subdivide white tef into very white (magna) and white (nech), though these categorizations remain subjective  (Baye, 2015) . Consumers prefer white tef over darker coloured types, but red tef, which is believed to be more nutritious, is also gaining popularity among health conscious consumers in Ethiopia  (Tefera et al., 2006

 Rasbak Maheder In Ethiopia, a country of nearly 90 million people, approximately 6 million households grow teff. The production and consumption of tef grain are matters of national policy, since food insecurity remains a serious problem. Tef is now considered a luxury cereal and its consumption is mostly an urban experience, as most rural people are unable to afford teff and rely mostly on less expensive grains to make injera. The Ethiopian governement banned the export of tef grain (but not of injera) in  2006 (Crymes, 2015 . Demands for teff grain by African diasporas, health conscious and gluten intolerant individuals in industrialised countries have led to increased production of teff internationally  (Miller, 2010; Crymes, 2015; Baye, 2015) . Though there is hardly any literature on the use of tef grain as a feed for livestock, its valuable nutrient composition could make it useful in animal production. 
 Distribution Tef is thought to have originated in Ethiopia, where it started to be used as a food grain between 4000 and 1000 BCE. It is mainly cultivated in its native range (Ethiopia and the highlands of Eritrea) and in neighbouring northern Kenya. It has been introduced into South Africa, the USA, Canada, Australia, the Netherlands and Yemen for small-scale production of gluten-free grain  (Tefera et al., 2006) . In the tropics, tef is particularly suited for altitudes ranging from 1300-2800 m, but can grow from sea level to an altitude of 3400 m. Only brown/red tef is grown above 2500 m. Tef is particularly valued for areas too cold for sorghum or maize, and it can be found in places where -15°C occurs provided the frost does not last too long  (NRC, 1996) . In Ethiopia, tef grows where annual rainfall ranges between 950-1500 mm with a growing season rainfall of about 450-550 mm  (Tefera et al., 2006) . Tef cannot withstand more than 2 500 mm rainfall. However tef can adapt to growing conditions ranging from drought to waterlogging. It is able to withstand wet conditions perhaps better than any cereal other than rice. Tef is mainly grown on sandy loams, but it can grow on black, heavy clay soils (black cotton soils) provided they are well drained and have sufficient N fertility. Neutral or slightly acidic soils are preferred  (Tefera et al., 2006) .Tef can withstand as much or more salinity than alfalfa  (Miller, 2010) . A C4 plant, tef makes efficient use of water and heat. It can grow in places prone to drought after short rains  (Tefera et al., 2006) . Tef grain production accounts for 25% of total cereal production of Ethiopia and was reported to be about 4.  
 drilling management Tef is an fundamental food crop in Ethiopia due to its specific agronomic capabilities. It is possible to harvest tef after a first cereal harvest in the same year  (NRC, 1996) . Tef may be used as an emergency crop when harsh conditions occur. Farmers can still sow tef when their other crops are failing and subsequently get grain only two months after and use it as a famine food  (NRC, 1996) . 
 Establishment Tef is propagated through seeds and should be used in sole cropping systems as tef does not withstand intercropping  (Ecocrop, 2016) . Tef is commonly grown in rotation with cereals, pulses and niger  (Tefera et al., 2006) . Tef requires a weeded, well-prepared, firm seed-bed. It can be planted, broadcast or sown at 15-20 kg/ha in rows, no deeper than 1 cm, and subsequently rolled  (Ecocrop, 2016; Tefera et al., 2006) . It must be regularly weeded. N fertilizer should be provided in low amounts, or tef should be sown after an N-legume in order to reduce the risk of lodging. Tef requires little care after establishment . Its rapid growth outcompete weeds. It suffers few diseases and pests attacks. In Yemen, it is considered a ""lazy man's crop"" as it does not require any care between sowing after flash flood and harvesting  (NRC, 1996) . 
 Harvest Tef is one of the fastest maturing cereal crops. Grain maturity occurs 2 months after sowing in very early-maturing types, in 3-9 months after in early-maturing types and 6 months after in late-maturing types. Tef maturity is indicated by the yellowing of the stalks bearing the spikelets  (NRC, 1996) . Harvesting after physiological maturity may result in seed shattering, especially in windy and rainy conditions. In Ethiopia, harvesting is done between November and early January. Tef is hand-harvested. The plants are cut at ground level with sickles and then transported to the threshing ground  (Tefera et al., 2006) . Threshing is done by animal trampling or by using treshers. All grain cannot be completely removed from the straw (Seyfu  Ketema, 1997; Alemayehu Refera, 2001) . Tef straw is soft and fast drying  (NRC, 1996) . Tef has a low estimated percentage post-harvest loss, about 3%, compared to the other cereals such as maize (25%) and wheat (26%)  (Kassier, 2002) . 
 Grain yields Tef grain yield ranges from 0.2 to 2 t/ha  (Lyddon, 2015; Alemayehu Refera, 2001 ). 
 Storage One advantage of tef grain is that it can be stored for an extended period of time, at least five years, under traditional storage conditions. The seed remains viable under such conditions for up to three years. It is no attacked by weevils or fungi, which reduces postharvest costs, as no protective chemicals are required for storage  (Kassier, 2002) . 
 Environmental impact Erosion control, ground cover, green manure Tef can serve as a temporary ground cover. Its very fast germination and fibrous root system development makes it an excellent choice for erosion control  (Miller, 2010) .  
 Nutritional attributes The nutritional value of tef grain is comparable to that of other major cereals. Tef is relatively rich in protein, though the literature reports a wide range of values: Baye, 2015 reports a range of 9-12.5% (DM) while the CGIAR/ILRI Subsaharan feed database reports an average of 13.2% DM and a range of 8.4-19.4%  (CGIAR, 2009 ). Tef has a good amino acid composition, with lysine levels (3.7% protein) and sulphur amino acids levels (methionine 4.1% protein) higher than those of wheat or barley  (Lester et al., 1981) . Tef contains about 73% starch, similar to maize grain and higher than for wheat and barley. The crude fibre content (3-4%) seems to be slightly higher to that of wheat and maize, and lower than than of barley. Crude fat (2.5-3.4%) is similar to that of other cereals  (Baye, 2015) . Tef contains high amounts of phytate (0.6-1.4%) comparable to those of other cereal grains, with a wide range of variability, probably due to differences in varieties and growing conditions. Tef has a higher iron, calcium and copper content than other common cereals  (Mengesha, 1966) . However, the difference in mineral content between and within teff varieties is wide ranging. Red tef has a higher iron and calcium content than mixed or white tef while the latter has a higher copper content than red and mixed tef  (Abebe et al., 2007) . The very high mineral content of tef has attributed to soil contamination, and particularly to the traditional threshing method by cattle trampling  (Baye, 2015) . 
 ruminants No scientific studies are available (as of 2016) on the utilisation of tef grain for ruminants. Because it is widely and safely used in human nutrition, grains discarded for food should be usable in the manner of other cereals, notably maize (large starch content) or wheat (good protein content). Its relatively high content in sulphur amino acids may be valuable. 
 Pigs No scientific studies are available (as of 2016) on the utilisation of tef grain for pigs. Because it is widely and safely used in human nutrition, grains discarded for food should be usable in the manner of other cereals, notably maize (large starch content) or wheat (good protein content). Its relatively high content in sulphur amino acids and low fibre content may be valuable for pigs. 
 Poultry Although no scientific studies are available on the nutritive value of tef in poultry (as of 2016), the chemical composition and the lack of major antinutritional factor suggest that its value is close to that of other cereals. Tef has higher protein content and slightly lower energy content than maize or sorghum, and its value would be closer to that of wheat or oats. Tef grain seems to be relished by birds as growing recommendations for tef crop include bird protection  (Yifru Teklu et al., 2005) . Tef grain was reported to be fed to captive buff-spotted flufftail (Sarothrura elegans) in southern Africa  (Taylor, 2010) . When available it is used by scavenging chicken  (Hayat et al., 2016) . 
 Rabbits No scientific studies are available (as of 2016) on the utilisation of tef grain for rabbits. Because it is widely and safely used in human nutrition, grains discarded for food should be usable in the manner of other cereals, notably maize (large starch content) or wheat (good protein content). Its relatively high content in sulphur amino acids may be valuable for rabbits, but attention should be paid to its low lysine content, as for other cereal grains.  3 million t in 2015, up from only 1.4 million tons in 2001 (Lyddon, 2015; Alemayehu Refera, 2001).

Parasitic infections in relation to practices and knowledge in a rural village in Northern Thailand with emphasis on fish-borne trematode infection.

Opisthorchis viverrini, a fish-borne trematode, is known to be one of the factors that may lead to bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma), which is endemic to Southeast Asia  [2] , and other helminths such as Taenia spp. are also widespread among Southeast Asian populations  [3] . Intestinal parasitic infections (helminths and protists) transmitted via the faecal-oral route are also of importance in this region due to the tropical environmental conditions that facilitate the maintenance of their life cycles. An overall decline in the prevalence of helminthiasis has been observed in Thailand over the last few decades, from  54.7% in 1980-1981 [4]  to  18 .1% in 2009 when the last national survey was conducted  [5] . However, according to this most recent survey, pockets of high infection still remain, particularly of O. viverrini, hookworms and Strongyloides stercoralis in the north and northeast of Thailand  [5] . Changes in the prevalence and incidence of pathogenic intestinal protists have not been estimated. However, the conditions and human behaviours that favour intestinal protists of medical importance are common to several helminth species; consequently, a decrease in the infection rates of many protists may be expected with a general approach. The National Health Assembly (NHA) of Thailand, an institution representing the government sector, civil society and the academic sector, passed a resolution in 2014 for the elimination of liver fluke (opisthorchiasis) and bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma) in humans. The resolution, acknowledging the importance of the incidence and mortality of bile duct cancer, insisted on the fact that 'the action taken must be integrated and cover all risk factors concerned, behavioural, environmental and cultural'  [6] . In Thailand, the overall poverty rate has continuously declined over the past 40 years, as shown by the increase in the Human Development Index from 0.574 in 1990 to 0.74 in 2015  [7] . Poverty is more prevalent in rural than urban areas, despite Thailand's universal healthcare system now providing coverage to 98% of the population  [8] . Notable parasitic incidences and prevalences are still recorded in parasitological surveys in rural communities  [9] . The identification of parasitological risk factors is important to explain prevailing parasitic infections in rural communities, which is one of the objectives of the present study. Although numerous parasitological studies have been conducted in rural Thai communities, the identification of risk factors is mostly limited to studies of single parasites such as Opisthorchis  [10]  or hookworms  [11] , despite the fact that rural communities are affected by multiparasitism (helminths and protists). The lack of studies covering the complete range of parasitic infections and including some risk factor analysis has been noted in other studies concerning Southeast Asian countries, such as a report of Clonorchis sinensis studied in Vietnam  [12] . A community-based study at the level of individual villager could potentially explore parasitic transmission and help to understand local perceptions of parasites, which may reveal some crucial factors influencing parasitic transmission. Thus, the aim of the present study was to acquire a better understanding of helminthic and protist infections in a rural community in Northern Thailand in relation to socio-demographics and the attitudes, customs, perceptions and knowledge of locals, as assessed by questionnaires, interviews and participatory methods. 
 Methods 
 Study area Individual participants inhabit Huay Muang village, located in Tha Wang Pha District (Nan Province), Northern Thailand. The centre of the village is situated at latitude 19.14°N and longitude 100.72°E at an elevation of around 300 m and is bordered by the river Rim. It is an ideal location for study because it is near the border with Laos in an area particularly rife with parasitic infections  [13] . The population of the village was 452 inhabitants, according to the Subdistrict Administration Office (SAO). This village has a predominantly agricultural way of life based on rice and maize cultivation, together with teak plantations. Agricultural plots are either on the edge of the river, permitting effective irrigation of the fields, and therefore flooding, or situated on slopes. The owners of fields along the river benefit from the high fertility of these plots. Demand for maize has driven the exploitation of slopes, potentially increasing soil erosion  [14] . 
 Human stool collection and intestinal parasitic examination In November 2012, a faecal sample (around 5 g) was collected from each participant in a plastic container which had been distributed to villagers with help from local health volunteers. The samples were brought to the field laboratory for further examination within the same day. The geographical coordinates of each household were recorded using a Garmin Montana 600 GPS device (Garmin International Inc., Olathe, KS, USA). The faecal samples were first checked for parasitic infections using the direct smear technique to screen for helminths and protozoa. Lugol's iodine was added to simple smears as a stain to better visualise and identify protozoa. Intestinal protozoan identification was performed by consulting the taxonomic literature  [15, 16] . Subsequently, a concentration method, a modified Katz thick smear technique  [17] , was followed to identify and quantify helminthic eggs or larvae present in faecal samples. The slides were coated with faecal samples (around 43 mg) sieved through a wire-net filter and then covered with a cellophane strip pre-soaked in Katz's solution (glycerine-malachite green solution). The prepared slides were left at room temperature for 30 min to allow the faecal matter to dry and clear, then the slides were examined and all helminthic eggs were counted under a light microscope by experienced parasitologists. Duplications of both the modified Katz thick smear and the simple smear were performed for each faecal sample. To assess the intensity of helminthic infection, the number of eggs per gram was calculated as described previously  [17] . 
 Ethical considerations The study procedures concerning human sample collection, laboratory investigation, interviews and questionnaires were reviewed and approved by the Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University (Bangkok, Thailand), Document No. 0517.1116/661. First, the investigation team conducted a meeting with local public health officers, the village chief and local health volunteers to inform people of the purpose and details of the research study. Then, public loudspeaker broadcasting was used to notify all households of the research goals in the local language. All participants who agreed to join the study were asked to read the participant information sheet explaining the objectives, procedures, possible risks and benefits of the research project. Consent/assent forms were signed by either participants themselves or the parents of child participants prior to faecal sample submission and acquisition of personal information through interviews and questionnaires. The age range of participants was from 10 to 102 years old. All participants infected with intestinal parasites, including helminths and protists, were informed individually of the diagnostic results and offered treatment by qualified clinicians from Tha Wang Pha District Hospital (Nan Province) and the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University. All infected participants were given deworming drugs: a single dose of praziquantel (40 mg/kg) was administered for fluke (fish-borne trematodes and Paragonimus) and tapeworm (Taenia) infection, while albendazole (400 mg tablet, single dose) was prescribed for nematode infection (S. stercoralis and hookworms). 
 Interviews and questionnaires The standardised questionnaires distributed to the inhabitants of Huay Muang village were carried out by the staff of the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University and validated by the Ethical Committee of Mahidol University, Document No. 0517.1116/661. Data were collected in Thai by the team at the Saen Thong primary care health unit (PCU), Tha Wang Pha District, Nan Province, and translated into English. These questionnaires provided individual data regarding participants' age, gender, level of education, profession, eating habits and knowledge of different types of parasites (by asking about the names of helminth species and their routes of transmission). The questionnaires were completed by 198 of the 228 villagers who participated in parasitic screening. The acquired data were merged with personal and demographic information (e.g. sex, age, address, educational level and occupation) extracted from the PCU records. Houses were geo-localised, and the distance (in metres) from each house to the river Rim was determined using Google Earth  [18] . 
 Participatory mapping In December 2012, participatory mapping was used as a way to collect data in a collective manner  [19] . During the mapping session, a collective interview was conducted involving 30 people who were among the 200 villagers who had participated in the parasitic screening. The group included both men and women, traditional healers, medical volunteers and village leader delegates. A satellite image of the village of Huay Muang and its surroundings was provided to the focus group during two participatory sessions and was used to draw a map locating flooding events and places perceived as high risk. 
 Statistical methods 
 Multivariate analyses First, we used principal component analyses to explore (1) individual parasitic infections (helminths and protozoa) and (2) the results of the individual questionnaires. This statistical exploration helped to quantify the homogeneity or the disparity in the infections and the responses to questionnaires by exploring the percentage of variance explained by the first two axes of each analysis, with a low percentage of variance suggesting low homogeneity among individual villagers (a higher number of axes would be necessary to capture the whole variance). We used the princomp function of the FactoMineR package, with the data centred and scaled. These analyses helped to compare the results of the present study with those of a previous study  [20] . Second, canonical correspondence analysis was performed to test the statistical association among the individual data for the two sets of variables. Wilk's lambda (Wilk's L) was used to test how well each canonical dimension contributed to the statistical multivariate model. The scale of Wilk's L ranges from 0 (full discrimination) to 1 (no discrimination). These analyses were performed using MASS version 7.3-45  [21] , FactorMineR and CCA version 1-2 embedded in R  [22] . 
 Univariate analyses Logistic regressions have previously been used by different studies to identify risk factors for parasitic infection  [23, 24] . A negative binomial model was used to overcome the overdispersion of the fish-borne trematode, O. viverrini-like egg count (while checking that the latter type had a better Akaike information criterion (AIC) than the Poisson model). The location of the river was introduced as distance in metres. Potential risk factors were selected at an α risk of 20% in univariate. A stepwise selection method based on minimisation of the AIC was then used to suppress variables that did not significantly explain the rate of infection. We also verified the non-nullity of the coefficients using the Wald test (P-value <5%). The interactions were tested via comparison of nested models; the model with interactions was kept if the statistic of the test exceeded the fractile of order 1-α of a law of χ 2 . This method makes it possible to manually remove non-significant variables from the model after automatic selection of the variables while verifying that this does not significantly modify the parameters of the model. The comparison of nested models was tested by the maximum likelihood method at an α risk of 5%. The results of the multivariate analyses were presented as the crude odds ratio and adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval using the package Rcmdr implemented in R. 
 Semi-variogram and kriging interpolation for fish-borne trematode infection The kriging method is widely used for predicting spatial patterns (e.g. the prevalence or intensity of infection) at non-sampling locations  [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Kriging involves including a fixed number of nearest neighbour points within a fixed radius  [26]  and relies on semi-variograms that quantify spatial autocorrelation among all pairs of data according to distance  [30] . Semi-variograms were estimated from survey data by calculating the squared difference of fluke intensity between all pairs of households. Intensity values were log + 1 transformed in order to fit the normal distribution. Semi-variance values were grouped and averaged according to separation distance (lags). A semivariogram model was fitted as a line through the plotted semivariance values for each lag using the packages automap and gstat  [31]  implemented in R. Kriging was obtained using the function krige of the package gstat and was applied using the values of the semi-variogram analysis, which interpolated or smoothed estimates, based on values at neighbouring locations and parameters from the semi-variogram  [32] . 
 Local participation in a parasitic control programme and health education In March 2013, after parasitic investigation and medical treatment, local administrations, i.e. the PCU in collaboration with the SAO, conducted a health education campaign aiming to reduce intestinal parasitic infection in the area. The programme focused on fish-borne parasitic diseases, one of the most common parasitic infections in the village of Huay Muang (see 'Results' section below). The villagers participated in a 2-day health education event which aimed to decrease raw food consumption and inform people of the negative health effects of foodborne parasitic infections and other intestinal parasitic diseases. The PCU and SAO also organised a cooking contest among the participants to create properly cooked traditional dishes with local freshwater fish under the motto 'Cooked fish, Clean and Safe'. Intestinal helminthic infection was reinvestigated in August 2013, after medical treatment and health education, again using a modified Katz thick smear technique (described above). The faecal examination was conducted by a local health service, the parasitological laboratory of Tha Wang Pha District Hospital. The participants, including those who had initially tested positive for intestinal parasites (i.e. paragonomiasis, fish-borne trematode and taeniasis patients) were also invited for a group discussion after taking part in the health education programme. Intestinal helminthic infection pre-and post-medical treatment and health education were compared and further discussed. 
 Results 
 Socio-demographics, customs and food consumption of Huay Muang villagers Of the 228 participants (50.6% participation rate) for whom parasitic data were acquired, demographic and social characteristics were available for 198 individuals (except for sex and age, for which data were available for all 228 participants from PCU records). Gender participation was balanced (49.6% males and 50.4% females). The level of education was rather low, with the majority of participants having no education or primary school Epidemiology and Infection education only (87.4%). The main employment of participants was related to rice and maize plantations (69.7%), although this mainly applied to a considerably older age group  (Table 1) . In terms of access to health services, the majority of participants asked advice from a doctor in case of illness in the previous year (75.8%). However, most (82.8%) did not examine their stools to check for the presence of parasites. Regarding eating habits, 74.7% of the population consumed uncooked fish in traditional dishes, with a large proportion of the population (82.3%) obtained fish from the natural environment (rivers or ponds) (  Table 2) . A large majority of individuals (73.7%) also consumed raw meat; 8% consumed raw pork and 77.4% consumed raw beef. The source of wild meat was reported as personal hunting activities (46.6%) or neighbours (61.1%). 
 Knowledge of parasites Participants in the study were also questioned on their knowledge of the main types of parasites and their modes of transmission. Knowledge of what can be identified as a worm varied from 15.7% to 71.2%  (Table 3) . Regarding parasitic transmission routes, 90% of people were aware of the risks of ingestion of raw food, including fish, crabs and meat. More than 60% of respondents mentioned other routes of exposure such as not wearing shoes, handling food with dirty hands, consuming unfiltered or unboiled natural water, or the presence of flies on food  (Table 3) . 
 Participatory mapping Two types of flooding areas were mentioned by the participants: areas that flood regularly and areas flooded in 2011, a year characterised by a large flooding event that is still present in the memory of the population. Participants were aware of water-related contamination by several diseases such as leptospirosis or fish-borne parasitosis (  Fig. 1) . However, most of the flooding risks mentioned by the interviewees related to socio-economic risks associated with damage to crop fields. Thus, people are more concerned about risks threatening financial wellbeing than infectious diseases. 
 Parasitological survey (pre-medical treatment/health education programme) A parasitological survey of 228 individuals allowed us to detect nine species of intestinal parasites in the village of Huay Muang. Four types of helminth eggs and a larva were detected, including a cestode (Taenia eggs), two trematodes (O. viverrinilike eggs and Paragonimus eggs) and two nematodes (S. stercoralis and hookworm eggs). In addition, four protists were identified (Blastocystis hominis, Endolimax nana, Entamoeba histolytica/dispar and Pentatrichonomas hominis) (  Table 4 ). The overall prevalence was 45.2% (n = 120) for helminth infections and 4.82% (n = 11) for protist infections. The dominant parasite eggs found in this study were the O. viverrini-like eggs (45.2%), followed by S. stercoralis (9.21%). All recorded intestinal protists showed a low prevalence (from 2.19% to 0.44%) (  Table 4) .  
 Results of multivariate analyses Based on the PCA results, the villagers of Huay Muang appeared very dissimilar in terms of level and diversity of infection, with intestinal helminths and protists with a low proportion of variance of 16.9% for the first principal component and of 14.4% for the second principal component  (Fig. 2a) . Higher homogeneity was observed in socio-economics and/or customs based on questionnaire responses, with a proportion of variance of 25.4% for the first principal component and of 19.5% for the second principal component  (Fig. 2b) . Parasite infection was significantly associated with socio-economics, but with only the first canonical dimension being significant (Wilk's L = 0.37, correlation coefficient = 0.40; P = 0.04,  Fig. 2c ) (distribution of individuals is given in  Fig. 3d) . 
 Results of univariate analyses Univariate analyses indicated that factors related to an increase of infection load for an α risk of 20% were being over 30 years old, being male, owning domestic animals, eating raw fish or raw meat, fishing and hunting, and living close to the river. Factors that seemed to protect against infection were education (primary level or higher), the use of toilets, visiting a medical doctor, and knowledge of parasites and their transmission (  Table 3) . 
 Determinants of fish-borne trematode intensity infection The identified risk factors for infection with a fish-borne trematode are presented in  Table 5 . The rate of infection with fish-borne trematodes was significantly higher among people over 50 years of age  Epidemiology and Infection 5 compared with those under 30 (P = 0.009,  Table 5 ). The intensity of infection (i.e. the number of parasite eggs) in people consuming raw fish was 10 times the intensity of infection in people that did not eat raw fish (P < 0.0001,  Table 5 ). People's occupation played a role in the intensity of infection; being a corn planter seems to increase infection burden (odds ratio = 2.85, P = 0.04), while farmers appeared to be infected at a lower rate than unemployed people. Although not individually significant, these variables contributed to the selection of the best model (using the AIC value)  (Table 5) . Finally, the distance from a person's house to the river was significantly associated with an increase in the intensity of infection by fish-borne trematodes. People living within 60 m of the river, i.e. in the row of houses closest to the river, had an infection intensity nine times that of people living further than 100 m from the river, whereas people living between 60 and 100 m of the river, i.e. in houses of intermediate distance from the river, had an infection intensity 5.6 times that of people living further than 100 m from the river, i.e. in the houses furthest from the river (  Table 5) . 
 Semi-variogram and kriging of fish-borne trematode The spatial distribution of the fish-borne trematode among households  (Fig. 3a)  was analysed using semi-variogram analysis with the best model function spherical. The kriging interpolation, using the results of the semi-variogram analysis, is represented in  Figure 3b . A high predicted density of fish-borne trematode infection corresponded to recurrent flooding areas identified by participants during participatory mapping  (Fig. 1) . 
 Helminth infection after health education All participants (n = 228) who sent faecal samples for the first parasitic investigation (in November 2012) also submitted faecal  helminth-infected patients were asked to attend a more in-depth interview to study their opinions about food consumption before and after health education  (Table 6 ). 
 Discussion The present study integrates several aspects of knowledge regarding parasites and their transmission to determine health risk  Epidemiology and Infection 7 factors based on a parasitological survey in a rural community. The parasitological survey showed that the most prevalent intestinal parasite found in human stools was fish-borne trematodes (45.2%). Although S. stercoralis (9.21%) and hookworms (1.75%) were present, no other soil-transmitted helminths were found despite the fact that 59.6% of the participants indicated that they were aware of Ascaris lumbricoides. This nematode was surely present in the past and may have disappeared or may still circulate at a low transmission rate in the community, or/and its symptoms may be more commonly observed in children than adults  [33] . Strongyloides stercoralis is highly endemic to Southeast Asia and has been reported in 32 community-based studies in Thailand (overall prevalence of 23.7%)  [34] . According to a previous report  [34] , this strongylid nematode has a very low prevalence in communities where faecal contamination is rare. The lack of sanitation reported by several households, in addition to the custom of walking barefoot, are factors favouring its transmission despite the fact that the majority of participants are knowledgeable about its transmission. The presence of hookworms was low, 10.2% in the present study, unlike in other recent surveys in rural Thai communities, in which prevalence ranged from 4.4% to 20.7%  [11, 35] . It has been shown that walking barefoot increased the risk of hookworm transmission by 2.8 times in central Thailand  [11] . In our study, 64.1% of participants were aware that walking barefoot increases the risk of parasite transmission. The presence of Paragonimus in the studied population (1.75%) is of interest as information about this parasite in humans is limited to some occasional cases of paragonimiasis reported in remote hilly areas of Thailand  [36] . Despite the fact that 92.4% of participants were aware that consuming raw crab meat can transmit parasites (by unintentional ingestion of metacercariae), the presence of four cases in the studied population showed that culinary habits prevailed over the perceived health risk. The presence of Taenia eggs (taeniasis) in stools (4.82%) may be associated with the consumption of unregulated meat (pork and beef). No veterinary services control for the presence of T. asiatica, T. solium or T. saginata in Thailand  [37] . According to the questionnaire results, the consumption of wild animals (including wild boars) was high, with 46.6% of respondents mentioning the consumption of bushmeat, which could also be an additional source of taeniases  [38] . Moreover, the consumption of raw meat (a custom followed by 73.7% of participants), including pork (93.8%) and beef (77.4%), carries other parasitological risks  [38] . Similar reports have discussed the difficulty of reducing the prevalence of fish-borne trematode infection by reducing the consumption of raw fish, even with health campaigns  [39] . The high prevalence of O. viverrini-like eggs (fish-borne trematodes) in faecal samples, 45.2%, highlights the fact that culinary culture plays an important role in parasite transmission even if the majority of the community is aware of the risks of eating raw fish (see below). The prevalence of intestinal protists was low, varying from 0.44% to 2.19% depending on the species. The reported prevalence of B. hominis (2.19%) was related to the consumption of contaminated food or water, close contact with animals, and poor sanitation. The faecal-oral route is the major transmission mode of this protist  [40] . It is frequently found in dogs  [41]  and is associated with gastrointestinal disorders  [42] . It should be noted that the diagnostic technique for Blastocystis sp. used in the present survey has a lower sensitivity than other techniques  [43] ; consequently, this prevalence could be an underestimation. Endolimax nana, Entamoeba spp., and P. hominis have similar transmission modes. Infection with P. hominis is considered to be asymptomatic, but this parasite is a probable causative agent of gastrointestinal disturbances in children  [44] , and again is frequently reported as highly prevalent in dogs  [45] . In addition to the potential pathogenicity of these parasites, their presence is an   Table 6 . Comparison of interviewing information from helminth-infected patients before and after receiving health educational activities (extracted from the report of the Primary Care Unit to the Subdistrict Administrative Organization) Group Before implementation After implementation Paragonimiasis patients Patients usually catch fresh water crabs and shrimps from stream and river for cooking, e.g. grilling, burning, dropping in boiled water or making curry, which may not be properly cooked. They also like to bring shrimps from the fresh water sources to do the traditional raw dishes. Patients realised that they will be infected by parasites if they consume raw crabs, shrimps, fishes or shellfishes. They will not eat them raw, and they need to be cooked before eating. 
 Fish-borne trematodes-infected patients Patients like to bring several species of cyprinoid fishes, e.g., Javean barb, Silver barb, Goldfin tinfoil barb and small-scale mud carp to make a raw dish called 'laab pla'. Patients say that they better cook fish rather than eat it raw. Proper cooked food is clean and safe. Taeniasis patients Patients like to eat raw pork or beef. It is also found that those who eat raw meat and are infected with parasites usually do self-medication by taking a dose of deworming drug (Niclosamide) every 6 months. Patients say that now they do not like eating raw meat but prefer proper-cooked meal instead. In general Some patients realised the effects of parasites on their health. However, in some situation such as going to work in distant field, they may be willing to take risk, e.g. drinking water from stream or pond; walking barefoot in the field because it is more convenient. Because of personal craving to eat raw fish or meat, just a little bit (not eat much), then they thought that it will not be contaminated by parasites. Now, villagers are afraid of parasites. So, they are informed and avoid any risk of exposure to parasitic infection, such as eating raw food, drinking water from natural sources without boiling or filtering and not wearing shoes when working in the field. 
 Epidemiology and Infection 9 indicator of poor sanitary conditions, given their faecal-oral transmission route  [9] . The most prevalent and/or pathogenic parasites observed in the community are transmitted through culinary habits (fishborne trematodes, Paragonimus and Taenia). Parasites transmitted through contaminated water, food and soil were less prevalent. Altogether, these observations show that while public health campaigns have succeeded in improving sanitation, they are less effective in influencing cultural culinary habits. Canonical analysis confirmed a statistical association between intestinal parasites and high-risk behaviour across the population. In particular, the habit of eating raw fish appeared to explain the observed association. The knowledge of participants concerning helminth parasites showed high variability according to helminth species. Ascaris and Taenia were the two most recognised species, possibly because the adult forms of these parasites are expelled in faeces after self-medication (deworming drugs purchased from the local pharmacy) and are bigger than other helminth species. It is less common to recover Trichuris and fish-borne trematodes in faeces, which may explain the lower level of recognition. Few studies have attempted to study the ability of rural communities to identify helminth species in Asia compared with other geographical areas such as Kenya  [46] , Tanzania  [47]  or the Ivory Coast  [48] . One study performed in Bangladesh  [49]  was limited to soil-transmitted helminths and did not provide many details about the helminths identified by participants. In Southeast Asia, previous studies on local knowledge were limited to O. viverrini  [39] . The present study is one of the few that investigate local parasitological knowledge; however, this should be extended to other communities in Thailand and across Southeast Asia. This study is thus in line with the commitment of the NHA to bring evidence and knowledge into the sphere of health policy-making  [50] . The responses to questionnaires show that villagers possess a good level of knowledge concerning the routes of parasite transmission, such as the consumption of raw crab, raw fish and raw meat, identified by more than 90% of the participants. Despite this, the inhabitants did not act accordingly, as 74.7% reported consuming raw fish regardless  [39] . A similar pattern was observed in the consumption of raw meat despite the associated risks, which the local community is also aware of. Although cysticercosis is a serious parasitic disease, the results of the questionnaires highlighted the difficulties associated with reducing raw pork consumption, a deeply rooted custom in northern rural communities in Thailand  [38] . The consumption of bushmeat by 46.6% of participants is also an important risk factor for several zoonotic infections  [51, 52] . The results of principal component analyses showed a heterogeneous distribution of both intestinal parasites and high-risk behaviour across the community. This may reveal a greater heterogeneity of the population with respect to their wealth and parasitic infections compared with less developed rural areas of Southeast Asia  [20] . The results of canonical analysis confirmed that the variability in parasite infection among inhabitants was related to the variability of socio-economic factors and associated behaviours. As lifestyles evolve, average wealth is improving along with health  [14, 53] . Health information campaigns and the improvement of the health care system have positively impacted parasitological burdens, although social and economic gaps are widening. The majority of social-demographic factors associated with infection with fish-borne trematodes are highlighted, with the exception of poor hygiene. As already mentioned, the most prevalent parasite was O. viverrini-like eggs, or fish-borne trematodes (probably minute intestinal flukes, e.g. Haplorchis taichui), which are recognised as a public health problem in northern and northeastern Thailand as well as some other countries in Southeast Asia  [2] . In Northern Thailand, particularly in Nan Province, it seems that minute intestinal flukes are more common than the liver fluke O. viverrini  [13, 54] . A very high incidence of the minute intestinal fluke H. taichui was reported in a study area in Nan Province (Chalerm Phrakiet District), but no O. viverrini infections were detected  [55] . Similarly, it was confirmed in a study in Nan Province (Bo Kleu District) that no O. viverrini adult worms were recovered after treatment of suspected opisthorchiasis cases; all of those worms were H. taichui  [54] . In addition, a high prevalence of H. taichui was shown both in intermediate hosts (snails and fishes) and villagers within the same area of Nan Province (Bo Kleu and Pua Districts)  [56] . However, this does not rule out the possibility that cases of O. viverrini infection exist in the study area. Fish-borne trematodes still require further genetic identification to confirm whether they are O. viverrini or some other minute intestinal flukes (Heterophyidae and Lecithodendriidae), as the eggs of these flukes are practically impossible to differentiate morphologically to the species level  [57, 58] . Metacercariae in fish are the source of human trematode infection; the local habit of eating raw fish was investigated in order to implement better preventive strategies and control transmission  [39] . The maximum number of eggs per gram of faecal matter (EPG) detected in an individual in the studied community was 503 EPG. According to another researcher, the intensity of infection may be classified as mild (1-999 EPG), moderate (1000-9999 EPG) or high (⩾10 000 EPG)  [59] . The average class of infection in the present study community was mild, but with a high prevalence (>40%), a pattern which has been observed previously  [60] . Significantly higher infection intensities were observed in participants who mentioned the consumption of raw fish in the weeks prior to the study, which primarily included people aged over 50 years. According to their responses, people in this age group did not use deworming drugs. Our results showed that there was a significant negative association between the proximity of houses to the river and infection intensity of fish-borne trematodes. This result supports previous findings  [61]  but here was observed at a high resolution, i.e. at the household level. The spatial density of fish-borne trematode infections predicted by kriging analysis seems to correspond to recurrent flooding areas mapped by participants during the participatory mapping. However, we should be aware of the limitations of our study, which was conducted at a small scale (households in one village) with the assumption of a spatial continuity in the infection process (the distance to river and flooding areas). Investigation of other villages is needed to confirm that kriging analysis is applicable to the investigation of parasitic infections on a small scale. We did not have information regarding the amount of fish consumed per habitant, nor on the relationship between this amount and direct access to the river, nor the sharing of raw fish dishes among neighbours (which is considered to be a risk factor)  [10] . We did not find a relationship between the use of toilets and fishborne trematode infection as observed in several previous studies  [61, 62] . Indeed, a large majority of participants reported that they use toilets. Wastewater may contribute to contamination of the river during times of heavy rain, particularly in plots of land located near the river, where recurrent flooding was recorded by  10  K. Chaisiri et al. villagers. However, the true boundaries of the flooding areas are hard to delimit without the use of external information, such as remote-sensing data. We found associations between higher intensities of MIF and short distances to the river, which roughly corresponded to flooded areas according to the participatory mapping. The participatory mapping suggested a spatial association between flooded areas and higher intensities of fish-borne trematodes. One hypothesis is that flooding events may wash eggs onto flooded plots, which may facilitate maintenance of the parasite lifecycle. The nearby residents and owners of these flooded plots may then risk infection by eating the fish that populate their land. The importance of a better understanding of the socioeconomic aspects of this issue has been highlighted by another researcher  [63] . Action taken by local public health administrative offices is key to sustainably controlling infectious diseases, including intestinal parasites. The 2014 NHA resolution insisted on the need to involve communities and to develop study plans for schools to educate pupils about safe culinary habits. A health education programme organised by the subdistrict PCU and SAO was positively received by the villagers. The participants acquired more knowledge of intestinal parasite infections, which in turn improved their culinary behaviour, sanitation and hygienic practices. The highlights of the health education programme were: (1) to translate the research outcomes to the local community;  (2)  to provide knowledge about endemic parasites in the area, their life cycles and their effects on human health; (3) to encourage better eating habits by avoiding raw or undercooked meat, which was expected to solve or reduce the problem of intestinal parasitic infections. However, annual monitoring of intestinal parasitic infections is required to assess changes in infection status and thus the efficiency of the implemented health education programme. 
 Conclusions Despite an accurate knowledge of worms and their transmission, particularly through traditional consumption of raw fish and raw meat, the studied rural community harboured some parasitic infections of significance. Our study emphasises the importance of studying the perceptions and practices of local communities in order to improve disease control strategies and public health.  [64] . Moreover, our study shows that participatory methods, from mapping to health education, offer great opportunities for ecological epidemiology. Author ORCIDs. C. Lajaunie 0000-0001-8838-9062 A.

The vegetation in these ecosystems is consumed by animals 2 , either wildlife or livestock, and is also used by the local communities for food, energy or medicinal purposes  3  . The open ecosystems in tropical northern Africa are of great importance for the economy, food security and human well-being. Plant diversity within these ecosystems is driven by many factors, such as the climate, soil, fire and grazing  4, 5  . Plant diversity in these regions is being greatly impacted by global change  [6] [7] [8]  . Historical data are needed to understand species and diversity dynamics. The database presented in this work is the collection of numerous datasets gathered over the years. At the outset, the FLOTROP database was intended to store all the data recorded by IEMVT (French institute for tropical livestock production and veterinary medicine, now part of CIRAD) in the sixties. In 1993, CIRAD and CNRS set up a project to collect a maximum of botanical surveys within these regions  [9] [10] [11]  . Two software packages were created by the team to manage the database. The first was created under DOS then a second was started under Windows using the APL DYALOG language. Data were gathered and scanned between 1993 and 2016. We extracted the data from the software version. We shared the species occurrences recorded in the database on the Tela Botanica website (http://www.tela-botanica.org/) and in the GBIF database  12  . The dataset is available following this link: https://doi.org/10.15468/oxunf1. 
 Methods Original data collection in the FLOTROP software. The different data were collected by the FLOTROP team, mostly Philippe Daget. Botanical surveys were collected from different sources: direct contact with the authors of the survey, collection of data from the supplementary materials of Masters or PhD theses, technical reports on research or development projects, books, etc. A large share of the survey was only available on paper and most of the collection work was to convert those data to digital format. www.nature.com/scientificdata www.nature.com/scientificdata/ All the observations are geotagged. For most of the survey, the coordinates were not recorded with a GPS. The coordinates were extrapolated using the location indicated in the surveys (i.e. name of the town, distance along the road from a known point, etc.) and a topographical map. The surveys without any geographical information were not included in FLOTROP. The survey protocols drawn up for the surveys were classed in 8 different categories: 1. Phytosociological unweighted surveys: These surveys contained the list of species presented at one station on one date. 2. Phytosociological weighted surveys: These surveys contained the list of species. For each species, the authors gave a Braun Blanquet score 13 . 3. Ecological surveys with species cover. These surveys contained all the species and their relative soil covers assessed using the Daget-Poissonet method 14 . 4. Ecological surveys with species contributions. These surveys contained all the species and their relative contributions to the plant cover assessed using the Daget-Poissonet method  14  . 5. Dominant species surveys. These surveys contained all the dominant species of the plant communities. 6. Ecological surveys with the number of individuals. In these surveys, the number of individuals per species was recorded. 7. Botanical occurrences. In this protocol, only one or a few species in the vegetation were recorded. 8. Surveys in experimental fields. These surveys were carried out in experimental fields. During all this collection work, the taxonomic referential was harmonized to the Lebrun Referential 15 . Extraction, clean up and dissemination of the bases. In 2016, we extracted all the surveys from the FLOTROP software coded in APL DYALOG, and transformed the information into a more available format (.txt format, thus access format). We found various errors in the database due to encoding problems during extractions: a mismatch between the protocol used and the way that abundance was coded, an inversion between the abundance and the number of species, and some surveys that were mostly only a list of species but were extracted as a survey with abundance. In this case, for half of the species, the number of species was inserted in the abundance columns. We ran several tests to check for such errors. ""Surveys containing such an error were flagged up"": (1) In the surveys with a Braun Blanquet score, the abundances could only be coded as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5. Otherwise, the surveys for this protocol that had abundance values different from these five were considered problematic and were not published. (2) In the surveys with species cover or a contribution estimation (protocols 3 and 4), the abundance estimation could not be over 100 (as 100% of the vegetation). The surveys that contained at least one species with an abundance over 100% were flagged up as problematic. (3) For all the surveys, if the species number and abundance were both over 100%, we assumed that it was probably a situation where the species number was placed in both the abundance and in the species number. (4) In the surveys with species cover or a contribution estimation (protocols 3 and 4), we flagged up the surveys where the sum of abundances was over 100%. These different flags did not necessarily mean that the survey was problematic, but it was a good indicator. For the time being, we have not included any surveys that were flagged up and have only published surveys that did not have these errors. We plan to review all the flagged up, and possibly corrected, surveys. This second database will be issued at a later date and the abundance estimators will also be included in this second release. We chose to update the species referential with the African Plant Database (APD), which is widely accepted for African studies and recommended by the Association of the Taxonomic Study of the Flora of Tropical Africa (AETFAT). The comparison between the FLOTROP and APD names used a Fuzzy Lookup process (Ms Excel add-in). The analysis was carried out on one field containing full names (species with authors), with a threshold over 75%. As a comparison of 8,337 × 250,000 matrix names induced computer difficultly, an initial comparison was made with only North African names and then with tropical names. About 800 names were visually checked because the similarity was very low (between 075-0.95%), and 70 names concerning introduced species where added to APD. However, for 18 species out of the 8,337 species described in the FLOTROP list, we did not find any correspondence with the APD database. These names were probably transcription errors or confused species in the different Floras, for which finding the right name is quite impossible. In these cases, the species were entered into the database with the name selected in the FLOTROP database. The information of the name referential is put in the identificationRemarks. For most of the surveys, the occurrences of species were also associated with an estimation of their abundance (either a percentage or Braun Banquet score, or individual counts). We only entered the occurrences. The different estimations of species abundances are available on request by email. 
 Data Records This dataset was included in The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)  16  . The data were also shared on the e-Flora of Tela Botanica (www.tela-botanica.org). The base included 342,698 occurrences for plant species in the African region between the 5 th and 25 th parallel north. In order to compare these datasets with the existing data shared in the GBIF, we extracted from the GBIF website, on 28 July 2017 (www.GBIF.org)  12  , all the species www.nature.com/scientificdata www.nature.com/scientificdata/ occurrences within geographical coordinates between the 5 th and 25 th parallel north and between longitudes 20°W and 52°E. We did not download the occurrences that were obtained from a fossil sample. From all these occurrences, we only selected the species within African countries contained in the FLOTROP area (list of countries in  Table 1 ). In all, 801,900 plant occurrences are already present (without fossil specimens). The FLOTROP database will increase the GBIF base by 43% for the area as a whole. Several variables are presented for each occurrence: Regarding the way data are downloaded on the GBIF site (Source data or GBIF archive), some numbers presented here may vary (especially for the taxonomic description). The number here corresponds to the source data file. (1) Basis of record: All the surveys were made based on human observation. On some occasions, herbarium samples were collected and were conserved in different herbariums, such as the ALF herbarium 17 (http:// publish.plantnet-project.org/project/herbieralf). (2) The date of the observation (event Date): All the surveys are dated. However, for some surveys only the year was known. In this case, the date of the survey is 1st January of that year. Similarly, for some surveys the month and the year of the survey were known but not the day, so in this case the date of the survey is the first of the month.  Figure 1  and www.nature.com/scientificdata www.nature.com/scientificdata/ for Egypt and 197% for Algeria. The contribution of FLOTROP is low for eastern Africa (an increase of only 3% of the GBIF data for Ethiopia) and for humid tropical western Africa. In tropical western Africa, the main ecosystem is tropical rainforest and FLOTROP only contains plant observations made in open ecosystems. (4) The coordinates of the observation (decimal Latitude and decimal Longitude): All the surveys are geotagged with an accuracy to the minute (around 1.83 km in these regions). The coordinates are written in decimal for the latitude and the longitude. The climate within these African countries is highly variable from desert to tropical forest in Chad, for example. The North-South gradient in that country is a good indicator of the annual rainfall, especially in western Africa (dry climate in the North and wet climate in the South).  Table 3  and  Fig. 2  show the plant species observation number in FLOTROP and GBIF for each parallel. Between the 11 th and 25 th parallel, the inclusion of FLOTROP in GBIF will at least double the data (for the 11th parallel) or increase the data 19-fold (21st parallel). FLOTROP will thus amount to unique data on the drylands of sub-Saharan Africa. All the coordinates are in WGS 84.  Figure 3  is a map of the density of occurrence of these species.   Figure 4  shows the number of occurrences for the 19 species that have more than 2,000 occurrences in the FLOTROP base and the number of occurrences that were previously in the GBIF base for the same region. Most of the species are at species level some only at genus level.     Table 2 . Temporal distribution of FLOTROP and GBIF data by decades. The percentage increase in data is specified. www.nature.com/scientificdata www.nature.com/scientificdata/    Table 3 . Distribution between the different latitudes of plant occurrences in the FLOTROP and GBIF databases. The percentage due to the inclusion of FLOTROP in GBIF is calculated in the last column. For the data obtained for FLOTROP, we carried out several tests to eliminate some encoding errors (see methods). We removed 90,000 occurrences for the upload, which will be corrected at a later date, based on expert knowledge. The quantity of data is also a factor of quality: indeed, one species occurrence can be compared with the whole set of occurrences for the same species, to find out the distribution of any outliers. Some of the original paper surveys included in the database are stored at CIRAD, in Montpellier. Where necessary, users can check the original if they need confirmation on the data. 
 Usage Notes The data presented here are a collection of multiple data sources, so they need to be analysed, using appropriate statistical tools. Users should remember that plant identification and taxonomy in Mauritania, Senegal, Mali and Niger are based on old Floras. Despite the large number of observations of this dataset and the updated nomenclature used, many species are only known by one or two specimens, sometimes without all the organs that are useful for good identification. New collections and observations are absolutely needed to confirm the identity or ecology of some complex taxa. The occurrence data can be used in at least two types of studies:  www.nature.com/scientificdata www.nature.com/scientificdata/ (1) Species distribution: Despite the fact that these data are not a full inventory of each country, for the main reason that they focus on herbaceous vegetation used for livestock or on potential economic species, they can be used to update national inventories or checklists, as in new Flora projects for Chad or Burkina Faso. (2) Species ecology: These data can be used to understand the ecology of a species and its spatial and temporal dynamics. Many different models and statistical analysis can be carried out to study species  18, 19  . For the spatial distribution of the species, users must be aware that the climate varied considerably in the West Africa over the period  7,8 (1950-2010)  and they must therefore include temporal changes in their spatial analysis model. (3) Biodiversity studies: These data can be used to assess some biodiversity indicators, such as alpha, beta and gamma diversity. Open ecosystems are composed of herbaceous and tree species. However, in the FLOTROP database some surveys were only carried out on herbaceous species, or on tree species. However, this information was not specified during the collection of the data. We therefore suggest that users take care when using the data where some surveys contain only one type of plant species. Moreover, due to the temporal differences and spatial life cycle of tree species and herbaceous species, it may be better to analyse both types of communities separately.

 Table 2 Table 1 . 21 present the temporal distribution of the data per decade. The oldest observation in the FLOTROP database is from 1930. The data in FLOTROP mostly fall within the 1960-2000 period. The decade with the most data is the seventies, followed by the eighties. Severe drought events occurred during these two decades, especially in West Africa.(3) The country (country Code): The country is coded following the ISO 3166 guidelines. Regarding the distribution by country, inTable 1, we have presented the number of occurrences in the FLOTROP database by country and by the data currently available in the GBIF database. The contribution of FLOTROP is quite consequent for Sahel countries (increasing by 1000% the data available for Chad, 600% for Mali and Mauritania, 500% for Niger, 300% for Senegal and 100% for Burkina Faso and Sudan (including South Sudan)) and for two small countries that are not well documented, Cape Verde and Djibouti. For the southern area of the Saharan countries, the contribution of FLOTROP is also substantial, increasing the GBIF data by 12% Distribution between the different countries of plant occurrences in the FLOTROP and GBIF databases. The percentage due to the inclusion of FLOTROP in GBIF is calculated in the last column. Country

Canberra : ANU Press, p. 403-415.  https://doi.org/10.22459/TA52.2019.19",22,20191211,,,"Introduction The three different island chains that compose the Vanuatu archipelago vary in age from 20 million years old for the western chain, five million years old for the eastern chain and to two million years old for the central chain where volcanoes are still active  (Carney et al. 1985 ;  Greene and Wong 1988; Hamilton et al. 2010; Monzier et al. 1997) . The local flora was established from three major sources: the Solomon Islands in the north, Fiji in the east and New Caledonia in the south  (Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg 1998) . These three sources are considered very rich and diversified botanically because of their ancient continental origins. Plants used different means to reach the islands of Vanuatu-winds, sea currents, birds or bats-and plant species established themselves naturally over millions of years. The arrival of predators (humans, rats, pigs and possibly dogs) is, in comparison, a very recent phenomenon that occurred only around 3000 years ago  (Bedford 2006; Petchey et al. 2014 ). 
 terra australis 52 In the Pacific, the number of seed plant genera decreases with island area and distance from New Guinea and the continental island of New Caledonia  (Keppel et al. 2009 ). As one moves away from continental sources, Pacific islands have lower species diversity. The dramatic decline in diversity between the ancient and large islands of the Solomons and smaller and younger islands of Vanuatu has encouraged archaeologists to suggest that beyond the Solomon Islands chain, the resources available to sustain populations fell off sharply  (Green 1991) . It has been seen as one possible reason that Pre-Lapita settlement did not happen in Remote Oceania and it inspired the term 'green desert' to qualify isolated islands such as Vanuatu  (Spriggs 1997:41) . Recent studies conducted on the Teouma Lapita site of Efate Island, Central Vanuatu, have, however, indicated that Lapita diet was probably based on a broad spectrum of foraging that does not exclude the possibility of eating locally found plant species ). How far plant species have spread into the Pacific depends on their dispersal abilities and on the ecology of the colonised islands. Coastal taxa are often well dispersed by flotation or rafting propagules and this dispersal ability has resulted in many species, including edible ones, becoming naturally pan-tropical  (Fosberg 1984) . When Lapita people first settled these islands, coming from the north, they most likely introduced with them their major staple crops: bananas (Musa spp.), the greater yam (Dioscorea alata) and taro (Colocasia esculenta), along with other crops (Abelmoschus manihot, Alocasia macrorrhizos, Saccharum spp.) . As these species have been asexually propagated since their ancient domestication further north in Melanesia  (Lebot 1999) , they were introduced in Vanuatu as vegetative propagules on voyaging canoes, just like elsewhere in Remote Oceania  (McClatchey 2012; Whistler 2009 ). This was a rather complex operation, as these propagules are highly sensitive to salt sprays and drought. Their successful establishment after arrival was most likely the object of great and delicate attention. Their vegetative propagation ratios being very low, several years, maybe even a decade, were necessary before a sufficient stock could be established to feed a small community and reach full carrying capacity, assuming that natural disasters (cyclones or drought) did not complicate this complex and risky task. There is now significant molecular evidence to confirm that the genetic bases of these staple crops are extremely narrow in Vanuatu, compared to the allelic diversity found further north for these species. Genetic diversity studies, conducted with isozymes and/or DNA markers (SSRs, AFLPs, DArTs), demonstrate that very few genotypes were introduced clonally. Most varieties found today are either: i) somatic mutants (sports) captured by cloning morphological variants while propagating mother plants; or ii) result from the selection of volunteers germinating in garden plots after cross-pollination and sexual recombination between parents genetically closely related. This is the case for yam (D. alata)  (Lebot et al. 1998; Malapa et al. 2005; VandenBroucke et al. 2016) , taro (C. esculenta)  (Kreike et al. 2004; Lebot et al. 2004; Sardos et al. 2012 ) and bananas (Musa spp.)  (Lebot et al. 1993) . These corroborating results indicate very few clonal introductions on canoes, from an already narrow gene pool, and the same bottleneck process also occurred further east in Polynesia  (Lebot 1992) . These molecular studies confirm that the propagation of the germplasm necessary for feeding important communities was obviously a very slow process that took decades, if not hundreds of years, before all the main islands of Vanuatu could be densely populated. Recent archaeological data have shown that the first settlers' diets were mostly protein-based and poorly diversified . The study of skeletal lesions in infants and adults at the Teouma Lapita site on Efate indicated that these communities may have been suffering from scurvy ). These observations revealed nutritional deficiencies during the colonisation phase of Vanuatu (c. 3000 years ago) and would tend to suggest two possibilities. The first scenario is that the archipelago was a 'green desert' at that time and that the absence of edible species had a serious impact on human health, as suggested by  Buckley et al. (2014) . This also implies that as the major food crops (bananas, taro and yam) are mostly carbohydrates (starch represents between 70 and 90 per cent of the dry matter) rather than sources of vitamins, proteins and minerals, many other edible plants would have been introduced from the north before well-balanced diets could be achieved. The second scenario would be that first settlers' unbalanced diets indicate that they did not exploit the potential of the local flora. Such behaviour could be driven by cultural traits: poor knowledge of the local flora (even if many species are similar than those found in the Solomon Islands), unwillingness to explore the inland forests of the new islands, and ease of collecting on the shores the necessary protein through fishing and hunting thanks to the abundance of rich wild resources (marine and terrestrial) (e.g.  White et al. 2010; Worthy et al. 2015) . Consequently, this raises the question of the edibility of the native plant species (those naturally established before the arrival of humans) around 3000 years ago in Vanuatu. In the present paper we will attempt to identify native edible species from the Vanuatu National Herbarium collection and will discuss their possible use as sources of essential nutrients. 
 Materials and methods The Port Vila National Herbarium (international code: PVNH) is managed by the Department of Forestry, at Tagabe, in Port Vila (www.forestry.gov.vu/). Approximately 20 000 specimens are preserved and more than 14 000 are recorded in a database along with their relevant passport data (publish.plantnet-project.org/project/vanuaflora_en/collection/pvnh/specimens). The first specimens were collected during the Condominium era and given back (to PVNH) in 1971 by the Royal Society. Since that time, numerous collections have been made by botanists from different countries. In the 1980s, ORSTOM (Office de la Recherche Scientifique et Technique d'Outre-Mer), today named IRD (Institut de Recherches pour le Développement), formalised the organisation and management of the herbarium and transferred PVNH to the Government of Vanuatu in 1988. More recently, an updated database, named 'Vanuaflora', was designed with Pl@ntNote (amap-collaboratif.cirad.fr/pages-logiciels/?page_id=410) and enriched with voucher specimens retrieved from the New Caledonia Herbarium in Nouméa. A total of 1586 species of vascular plants have been collected and identified; 1166 species are considered to be natives (73 per cent of total spp.) and represent 550 genera assembled in 166 families. In order to assess if a species is truly native, different approaches are usually combined. A species is considered 'native' if its presence is the result of only natural processes with no human intervention. Its introduction to the Vanuatu archipelago has, therefore, to result from: flotation and drifting across the ocean (hydrochory), internal animal dispersal (endozoochory), external animal dispersal (epizoochory), bats (chiropterochory), birds (ornithochory) or wind (anemochory). This can be confirmed by the species biogeography and the study of related species (from the same genus) in the three regional sources nearby (Solomon Islands, Fiji and New Caledonia). Observations on the ecology of the plant recorded when collecting the specimen individual are also used to clarify if the species is self-adapted or self-seeded, easily spread by local vectors and well-distributed spatially (throughout Vanuatu, indicating an old natural introduction). Finally, balanced sex ratios (for dioecious species), pollen fertility and genetic evidence for true natural populations, revealed by molecular markers, are also used when available. These different approaches are combined to extract (in an Excel spreadsheet) a list of native species. Local knowledge recorded in situ at the time of voucher collection is then used to confirm if the useful plant organs can be eaten raw or if cooking techniques are needed before consumption.

 Results Native edible plant species can be classified into five groups: fruits, nuts, leaves, palm hearts, and roots and tubers  (Table 19 .1). Fleshy fruited species are very diverse and most likely represented wild food resources readily available upon arrival. The coconut (Cocos nucifera) was of course on the shores before people arrived  (Spriggs 1984) , as were many Pandanus and Freycinetia species with tasty edible fleshes, rich in starch and juice . Many of these fruit species were disseminated by bats, birds or ocean currents and reproduce spontaneously in the wild  (Wheatley 1992) . They are also geographically widespread, with some morphotypes being better adapted in the south rather than in the north of the archipelago, others on the windward rather than the leeward sides of a given island. Numerous distinct morphotypes exist within each species, indicating their ancestry and their genetic variation . Harvest is often opportunistic as the fruiting season can be quite short. Some are very tall trees producing hundreds of kilograms of fruit with high vitamin C content when mature (e.g. Dracontomelon vitiense, 28 mg per 100 g edible portion). Most figs (Ficus spp.) are also very rich in vitamin C, with content up to 72 mg per 100 g of edible portion  (English et al. 1996)    (Figure 19 .1). 
 Figure 19.1. Ficus wassa. This wild tree is never cultivated, it is very vigorous and easily dispersed by birds. The figs can be boiled in bamboo containers when they are green. They become rosy and red at maturity and can be eaten raw. It is available throughout the year. Young leaves are also eaten. Source: Stuart Bedford. Tremendous intra-specific variation exists for nut species as well, and some of them are dioecious and highly heterozygous. Canarium species and several other fruit trees are often considered to have been domesticated elsewhere in Near Oceania and humanly transported  (Yen 1974) . However, close observation of their fruits and kernels reveals that they can disperse easily through flotation or on drifting rafts, and there is evidence to favour their natural establishment on the Vanuatu islands before the arrival of humans. Canarium harveyi exists naturally only in the Solomons, Vanuatu and Fiji. It is found on all the islands of Vanuatu and nowadays numerous wild trees can be observed in undisturbed habitats such as the forests of central Erromango  (Wheatley 1992) . There are several botanical varieties of C. harveyi but two are found only in Vanuatu: C. harveyi var. nova hebridense in the north (Banks archipelago) and C. harveyi var. harveyi in Erromango. Distinctions are made mostly on the shape of their nut (var. harveyi has a triangular section while var. nova hebridense has three dorsal and one ventral crests). As Canarium spp. are large, slow-growing dioecious trees within the wild, such morphological differentiation reveals a very ancient establishment of natural populations. Canarium indicum also shows great variability in Vanuatu. The variation includes the shape of the fruit but also the number of kernels in a shell, their colour, the rhythm of flowering, the productivity and the ease of cracking the nuts. The species is more frequent in the northern part of Vanuatu, becoming rarer in the southern part. In Vanuatu, Canarium spp. found in the wild are highly heterozygous, with some nuts so rich in polyphenols (with a turpentine-like distinctive smell) that it is better to avoid them. Most of these nuts are very rich in fat (11 to 40 g per 100 g of edible portion) and proteins (8 to 12 per cent)  (English et al. 1996) . Most ferns have edible young leaves and all native palm species produce long cylindrical hearts, easily accessible when the plants are still young  (Figure 19 .2). Although they are poor in dry matter (90 per cent water), they represent a good source of minerals. Some palms (such as Veitchia sp.) also produce dense clusters of fruits, which are eaten when immature and soft and are rich in minerals. Three yam species (Dioscorea bulbifera, D. nummularia and D. pentaphylla) grow wild in Vanuatu. A fourth one (D. hebridensis) has been identified but seems to be a variant morphotype of spontaneous D. nummularia wild forms. All three species produce numerous seeds adapted to wind dispersion. Important natural populations have most likely been destroyed by pigs, which can easily uproot their superficial tubers. However, in favourable but isolated areas (like south-east Ambrym or on the now-unpopulated Lopevi Island), it is still possible to find in the forest numerous individuals of wild D. nummularia. Their tubers are often very thin and long (about 3 to 5 cm in diameter), very superficial and do not require detoxification  (Figure 19 .3). They can be readily roasted on a fire and are very rich in starch (80-92 per cent of dry matter). On the other hand, wild forms of D. bulbifera and D. pentaphylla often necessitate detoxification via cooking to remove the bitterness (alkaloids and polyphenols). They are, however, easily accessible and convenient sources of energy, just like Pueraria lobata, when cyclones have damaged wild fruit and nut trees species. This is a shade-loving small palm (3-6 m) growing wild under the canopy of taller trees and very frequent throughout the islands of Vanuatu. The heart is easily accessible and can be eaten raw. It is very tasty and refreshing and is appreciated by hunters having to spend some time in the forest. Source: Stuart  Bedford.  terra australis 52 Although they are not covered in the present study, seaweeds deserve at least a mention as they are nutritionally important. Seaweed harvesting is usually combined with reef gleaning and collection of shellfish. The common edible seaweed (Caulerpa racemosa) is pantropical and widely distributed along the shores of the archipelago. Other edible species exist such as Acathophora spicifera, Gracilaria verrucosa and Hypnea pannosa. These seaweeds can be eaten raw and are a rich source of vitamins and minerals. The algal flora species of Vanuatu belong to the Indo-Pacific biogeographic province and 55 per cent of the species present in Santo are in the Solomon Islands  (Payri 2011) , suggesting that the new settlers would have recognised them as a convenient source of food upon arrival. The list is not exhaustive but includes species that are easily accessible, tasty and readily consumable with minimum effort. *different parts of the plants are edible: hearts, fruit, leaves, tuber. Source: Authors' summary of data. 
 Discussion The large islands of Vanuatu (Santo, Malakula, Efate) are considered to be approximately 14-20 million years old  (Hamilton et al. 2010) . As the archipelago is quite close (between 1000-2000 km) to floristically rich continental sources (Solomons, Fiji, New Caledonia), plant colonisation via natural means was a fairly straightforward and easy process over such a long period of time (several million years). The first descriptions of the islands made by Quiros, Bougainville, Cook and others, insist on the rich and dense flora, still there after 2700 years or so of colonisation by humans. Despite 3000 years of successive waves of invasion by predators (humans, pigs, dogs and rats), numerous edible wild plant species still exist today and are found throughout the Vanuatu archipelago. They represent approximately 10 per cent of the total number of native species of 1166 taxa and are reliable sources of healthy food in times of scarcity, and often used by the local communities to diversify their diets. Many of these species, or related ones, also exist in the northern part of Melanesia. It is, therefore, possible that they were easily recognised by the first migrants who foraged and gathered food from the Vanuatu forests while waiting to build up a stock of staple crops vegetatively (greater yam, taro and bananas). In fact, the native flora may have been richer than it is today. For example, pollen records, dated 3900-3790 cal. BP, are available from a site nearby the Teouma Lapita site (Emaotfer swamp) on Efate  (Combettes et al. 2015) . This palynological analysis recorded pollen of Podocarpus sp., but today it is impossible to find the species on Efate and it is restricted to the northern part of the archipelago. It has been shown that the first settlers' Lapita Cultural Complex included horticulture of vegetatively introduced crops  Bedford 2005, 2010; Horrocks et al. 2009 ). However, in a climatically variable environment such as the South-West Pacific  (Lebot 2013) , vegeculture must be combined with fruit and nut gathering to diversify diets. Staple crops provide mostly carbohydrates while ferns, green young leaves, fleshy fruits and nuts represent foods rich in proteins, lipids and/or vitamins and essential minerals. However, there is also a cropping system rationale to associate plants vegetatively propagated (with no tap root and a superficial rooting system) to trees that protect them from winds and drought and provide the necessary buffers to plot microclimate variation. Therefore, the traditional systems had to establish small plots of vegetatively propagated crops and to surround them with tall trees. Arboriculture is the necessary technical complement of vegeculture or the latter will fail. 
 terra australis 52 In Vanuatu, the numerous indigenous wild fruit and nut tree species have been domesticated (and still are in many cases) following a simple straightforward process. When a wild productive morphotype is identified in the forest, the fruits and nuts are tested and if the quality is acceptable, a seedling found under the mother tree is collected and planted closer to the community settlement. Unlike the wild mother plant, the seedling is usually planted in well-tended and improved environment that favours its establishment and growth contributing to the ennobled development of the selected wild genotype. Over the long term, the continuous selection has led to the improvement of local wild species but gene flows between selected and wild forms continue, and most useful tree species are still very diverse. We cannot yet observe a reduction of the genetic base . Species evolution in an environment almost free of natural predators has considerably limited the number of species that need to accumulate toxins to protect themselves from potential damage. Many plants are therefore edible in their fresh and raw form and do not necessitate detoxification via cooking. However, the availability of local cooking containers (Bambusa vulgaris) or Licuala grandis leaves could have increased the number of wild edible species. Bambusa vulgaris rhizomes are very large and are often eroded from riverbanks and found drifting away in the ocean. They can colonise isolated islands by natural means and the natural bamboo forests found today on the west coast of Santo have all the attributes of a native, indigenous species. If this resource was readily available, it obviously represented a practical means of having access, after cooking, to numerous native edible species. In this chapter, we have attempted to show that there were several good edible plants in Vanuatu prior to human colonisation, the most diverse ones were certainly the palms (including the coconut), the figs and many other fruit and nut species, ferns and wild yams. Although Vanuatu was not a 'green desert', as has been earlier proposed, recent studies do indicate that Lapita colonisers could have focused overwhelmingly on the most easily accessible and very abundant terrestrial animal and marine resources rather than exploiting the edible local flora. However, there is no reason to believe that the diminution of plant species from Near to Remote Oceania could have been a factor restricting human colonisation of the area during the Pleistocene.

It is one of the world's most important and widely planted genera. It has been introduced worldwide, including Tunisia, and mainly cultivated for its timber, pulp and essential oils that possess medicinal properties and therapeutic uses  (Slimane et al. 2014 , Sebei et al. 2015 . Eucalytus is also known for its melliferous characteristics in the production of high quality honey. This fast-growing species adapted ver y well to the Tunisian climate and was used to stabilise the costal dunes of northwest Tunisia, reduce erosion and protect the roadsides  (Khouja et al. 2001, Dia and Duponnois 2010) . Nowadays, Eucalyptus is the second major Tunisian reforestation wood species covering 43,000 ha with an annual production of 3 m 3 annum -1 ha -1 , that gives a potential annual wood production of 120,000 m 3 (FAO 2012). However, the industrial use of these valuable Eucalyptus is the second major wood species used for Tunisian reforestation since 1957, and they are found around the country in several arboretums. Eucalyptus may be an interesting raw material to the Tunisian wood industry. The main obstacle to its industrial exploitation is its natural propensity to incur internal checking, collapse and a high transverse shrinkage during industrial drying process. This study focused on the physical and mechanical properties of reforested Eucalytus saligna and Eucalyptus camaldulensis from the north west of Tunisia. Moisture content, densities, shrinkages and mechanical properties were determined. Then, the impact of pre-steaming on the physical properties of modified wood was investigated. The results showed that both Eucalyptus possess low dimensional stability and mechanical properties compared to other Eucalyptus species from Tunisia, Morocco, Australia and Brazil. These wood characteristics were mainly due to their low density and sensitivity to collapse reactions, occurred during drying. Pre-steaming process reduced Eucalypts wood moisture content, changing the wood permeability and resulting in a residual collapse recovery and a decrease in wood shrinkage. Pre-steaming treated E. camaldulensis and E. saligna wood could be valuable as furniture and/or structural material without being submitted to moisture content variation. 
 COLLAPSE AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF NATIVE AND PRE-STEAMED EUCALYPTUS CAMALDULENSIS AND Keywords: Collapse phenomenon, densities, mechanical properties, shrinkages, Tunisian Eucalyptus Eucalyptus wood remains mainly restricted to fuelwood or pulpwood because of limited research on utilisation of wood; usage of the Eucalyptus wood as material is ver y limited in  Tunisia (Kabir et al. 1995) . Eucalyptus is considered as an invasive wood species that needs to be economically valued. Despite the abundance of the species, only recently efforts have been made towards its full utilisation. Marketing of Eucalyptus products has been hindered by lack of knowledge about its wood properties. However Eucalyptus has currently become a subject of interest as raw material for wood composite panels in many tropical and subtropical countries including Thailand,  Chile, Brazil and Malaysia (Nacar et al. 2005) . In the coming years, there will be a large supply of Tunisian plantation timber for different segments of the forest market. Thus, the development of Eucalyptus solid wood products seems to be ver y promising at the © Forest Research Institute Malaysia national level. The main challenge in developing high value-added products from Eucalyptus, such as remanufactured lumber, is the inherent difficulties in drying this species. Because of the natural propensity to internal checking, collapse and a high transverse shrinkage, lumber grade recovery after industrial drying is generally very low. Unacceptable internal checking and collapse after drying, reported in scientific literature for several Eucalyptus wood species, confirmed that the commercialisation of Eucalyptus as solid wood products remains a great challenge  (Northway 1995 , Ananias et al. 2014 . Therefore, a good understanding of the relationship between collapse and wood characteristics is needed to successfully process this species into commercial solid wood products. In addition, wood pre-treatment can be performed to improve wood properties and limit checking and recover collapse. A variety of pre-drying treatments is discussed ranging from storage in controlled environments, to various wrapping types, pre-surfacing and preheating. Cutting boards radially, rather than tangentially, can also be regarded as a form of pre-drying treatment, as well as the application of an end-coating to freshly sawn logs. Preheating green timber prior to drying include steaming microwave treatment and pre-freezing, and boiling  (Ellwood 1953 , Lee and Jung 1985 , Haslett and Kininmonth 1986 , Vermaas and Bariska 1995 , Zhang et al. 2011 , Kong et al. 2017 ). Such treatments result in increased permeability and drying rate, which reduces wood drying time  (Yang and Liu et al. 2018) . The steaming of wood is a technique which has been employed for a variety of purposes in the conversion and utilisation of forest products. These include the facilitation of bending, alteration of colour, reduction in levels of growth stress, improvement in dimensional stability, increase in permeability and improvement of penetration by preser vatives, facilitation of enzymatic hydrolysis, reconditioning of collapseprone species and the reduction in dr ying time and rate during seasoning  (Tieman 1929 , Greenhill 1938 , Perkitny et al. 1959 , Campbell 1961 , Ellwood and Erickson 1962 , MacKay 1971 , Chen 1975 , Chen and Workman 1980 , Shimizu et al. 1983 , McGinnes and Rosen 1984 , Weik et al. 1984 , Lee and Jung 1985 , So 1985 , Barnes 1986 , Cutter and Phelps 1986 , Haslett and Kininmonth 1986 , Donaldson et al. 1988 . During steaming, the growth stresses of wood can be released by means of microstructural reorganisation and thus, improve the quality of timber (Length and Kamke 2001;  Kiemle et al. 2014 ). The wood is also softened and growth stress is released as it reaches the glass transition temperature during drying process. The wood ductility is increased due to its improved viscoelastic properties, and finally results in decreased drying cracks and collapse . The objectives of this study were (i) to determine the physical and mechanical properties of reforested E. camaldulensis and E. saligna, (ii) to evaluate the impact of steam pre-treatment on the physical properties of modified wood and (iii) to identify the potential valorisations of E. camaldulensis and E. saligna woods in Tunisia. The results obtained could contribute towards the development of a database, useful for planting and processing. It will also be useful for tree breeders and silviculturists to identify the properties that need improvement through breeding selection or forest management strategies. 
 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 Wood selection and sampling In this study, 50 years old E. camaldulensisa and E. saligna wood species were chosen to estimate the physical and mechanical properties of Eucalyptus wood species from Tunisian reforestation. A total of 3 trees of each wood species were collected from Zarniza arboretum, governorate of Bizerte, regions of Sejnane (37°9' N, 9°7' E), from selected healthy trees, free from defects and alteration, with almost perfectly straight trunk  (Figure 1 ), according to  Oger et Lecerq (1997) . The Eucalyptus trees were selected as representatives of their respective populations within the arboretum (tree dimeter of 40 cm at 1.30 m from the ground). The climate of this northwest region of Tunisia is sub-humid with an annual rainfall of 927 mm year -1 . Average annual temperatures range from 14.9 °C to 18.5 °C. The average maximum temperature of the warmest month reaches more than 35 °C, and the average minimum of the coldest month is around 4 °C. The soil is poorly developed in coastal dunes with leached brown forest in the mountains  (Rejeb et al. 1996)

 Physical properties Wood samples used for the physical and mechanical characterisations do not differentiate the sapwood and heartwood for selected trees, because the sapwood/heartwood ratios are different relating to the trees. The aim of this study is to valorise eucalyptus woods without separating sapwood and heartwood. Wood samples for physical and mechanical tests were randomly chosen from the log, in order to observe the high results generally obtained in such characterisations  (Figure 2 ). An overview of sampling performed on the different trees, for physical and mechanical tests, is shown on  Figure 2 . 
 Relative humidity To measure the humidity of trees, a wooden disk of 50 mm thickness was cut at 1.35 m from the ground for each selected tree (  Figure 2) . Then, wooden disks with dimensions of 20 × 20 × 10 mm (along the grain) were cut from the samples, according to the repartition presented in  Figure 3a . Profiles of humidity repartition within the wooden disks were drawn and moisture content calculated using the following equation: EMC (%) = 100  (m h -m 0 ) m 0 (1) Where m h is the green mass of the initial sample and m 0 is the oven-dried mass of the wood sample. 
 Density and shrinkage To perform the physical tests, two wooden disks of 50 mm thickness were cut at 1.40 m from the ground for each selected tree; one disk to determine the native wood properties and the other to evaluate pre-steaming process on wood collapse phenomenon  (Figure 2 ). Selection of the samples was similar for the two disks (in position, distance to pith and azimuth angle from the north) in order to obtain a good comparison between native and steamed wood samples. To avoid errors during sampling, extreme cases such as excessively knotty trees, presence of reaction wood or slope grain were taken into account  (ISO 4471 1982) . From each disk, samples of 3 cm width, from bark to bark, were cut in both directions; N-S and E-W (  Figure  3b ). These samples were then cut into strips of 2 cm thickness. In total, the density and shrinkage measurements (with and without steaming) were    
 Density Basic density, air-dried density (after conditioning in a climatic room at 20 °C and 65% RH) and oven-dried density (after conditioning in an oven at 103 °C) (D m12 , D m0 ) of the wood samples were determined according to International Organization for Standardisation Standards using wood specimens of 20 × 20 × 10 mm (along the grain) (ISO 13061-2 2014). The shape factor (βt βr -1 ) was the ratio between tangential and radial shrinkage. The densities were determined by the gravimetric method  (Haygreen and Bowyer 1996) . D b = m 0 V h (2) D m0 = m 0 V h (3) D m12 = m 12 V 12 (4) Where m h is the humid mass of the initial sample, m 0 is the oven-dried mass of the wood sample, and m 0 and m 12 are the oven-dried and air-dried weight of the sample (g), respectively; D b is the basic density of wood (g cm -3 ), D m0 is the oven-dried density of wood (g cm -3 ) and D m12 is the air-dried density of wood (g cm -3 ); V h is the green volume of the specimen (cm 3 ), V 0 is the oven-dried volume of the sample and V 12 is the air-dried volume of wood sample. 
 Shrinkage without steaming Shrinkage (β) [tangential (βt), radial (βr), longitudinal (βl) and volumetric (βv) of the wood samples were determined according to International Organization for Standardisation Standards using wood specimens of 20 × 20 × 10 mm (along the grain) (ISO 4469 1981). The shape factor (βt βr -1 ) was the ratio between tangential and radial shrinkage. Volumetric shrinkage was measured using the following equation: B v = (V h -V 0 ) V h  100 (5) Similar operations were used to determine tangential (βt), radial (βr) and longitudinal (βl) shrinkages, using dimensional variation of the respective orientation. 
 Shrinkage with steaming In order to avoid the collapse phenomenon, each wood specimen was placed into a chamber with adjustable temperature and relative humidity for progressive reconditioning until mass stabilisation of 16% moisture content. After reconditioning, samples were autoclaved at 90 °C, 2.5 bars, for 30 min. Mass and 3-dimensional measurements were taken for each sample, prior to drying at 103 °C until mass stabilisation. Mass and 3-dimensional measurements of the dried samples, and shrinkage (β 0 ) [tangential (βt 0 ), radial (βr 0 ), longitudinal (βl 0 ) and volumetric (βv 0 )] of the pre-streamed wood samples were determined in the same way as for shrinkage without steaming  (ISO 4469 1981) . The shape factor (βt 0 βr 0 -1 ) without collapse was also determined. 
 Comparison between shrinkage with or without steaming In order to evaluate the collapse phenomenon effect on wood shrinkage, Indicators of Collapse Recovery (IRC), in the three directions, were determined according to the following formula: IRC (β v ) = (β v -β v0 ) β v  100 (6) Similar operations were used to determine tangential IRC (βt), radial IRC (βr), IRC longitudinal (βl) shrinkages, and IRC(βt/βr), using dimensional variation of the respective orientation. 
 Mechanical properties To perform mechanical resistance tests, three point bending (MOR) and compression tests were carried out for each of the selected wood tree samples, and results were compared. A universal mechanical test machine was used for the measurements. Samples were conditioned in a climate-controlled room with 65% RH and at 22 °C, for the time required to stabilise the samples weights.  
 Bending test Three point static bending tests were carried out according to EN 408 (2010). The sample size was 300  20 mm  20 mm 3 (L  R  T). The moving head speed and span length were 0.09 mm s -1 and 260 mm, respectively. The load deformation data obtained were analysed to determine the modulus of rupture (MOR). The tests were replicated on 20 samples from each selected Eucalyptus tree. 
 Compression strength parallel to grain Compression tests were carried out according to EN 408 (2010). Deviating from the norm, a reduced specimen size of 30  20  20 mm 3 (L x R x T) was used. The moving head speed was 0.09 mm s -1 to ensure wood sample rupture within 1.5 to 2 minutes. The load deformation data obtained were analysed to determine the modulus of rupture (MOR). A total of 20 collapsed wood specimens per selected tree were tested. 
 Statistical analyses Statistical analyses (one-way analysis of variance) using Fisher test and JMP 10.0.2 program were performed. The effects of pre-streaming process on E. camaldulensis and E. saligna on wood densities and shrinkages properties were evaluated using ANOVA and Duncan's comparison test. Such analysis allows to class results into several categories from A to C. Systems which are not connected by the same letter are largely different at the 5% level. The studied E. camaldulensis and E. saligna woods was characterised by low initial moisture content wood, when being felled. The results showed that initial moisture content repartition   Figure 4  shows that the moisture content of E. saligna wood increased progressively from the pith to bark, whereas the opposite was observed for E. Camaldulensis wood. 
 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 Moisture content The mean values of moisture content for E. saligna increased from 40% for the core wood, 85% for transition wood area to 120% for sapwood. On the contrary, the mean values of moisture content for E. camaldulensis decreased from 120% for the heartwood, 85% for transition wood area to 60% for sapwood (  Figure 5 ). According to literature, moisture content of fresh felled eucalyptus trees vary relating to the wood species. Elaieb et al.  (2017)  and  Ananias et al. (2014)  found similar trends in initial wood moisture content distribution within E. loxophleba, E. salmonophloia and E. nitens tree. The results showed that initial moisture content of heartwood was considerably higher than transition and sapwoods. However,  Fromm et al. (2001)  highlighted that moisture content of various Spruce and Oak trees decreases from early wood to late wood. 
 Density Air-dried density (Dm 12 ) is commonly used to compare different woods. Basic density (D b ), oven-dried density (Dm 0 ) and air-dried density (Dm 12 ) were measured on each E. camaldulensis and E. saligna wood sample. Average values, maximal and minimal values of the different densities and coefficient of variations are presented in  Table 2 . D b , Dm 12 and Dm 0 were 0.639 ± 0.014 g cm -3 , 1.001 ± 0.014 g cm -3 and 0.772 ± 0.028 g cm -3 for E. camaldulensis and 0.544 ± 0.070 g cm -3 , 0.804 ± 0,019 g cm -3 and 0.739 ± 0,020 g cm -3 for E. Saligna, respectively. E. camaldulensis and E. saligna wood species is classified as heavy wood (D m12 > 0.95) and from mid-heavy wood (0.65 > D m12 > 0.80) to heavy wood (D m12 > 0.95), respectively  (Campredon 1967) . Similar results were showed by a study conducted on 61 different Eucalytus tree species from Austalia (including E. camaldulensis, E. platycorys, E. loxophleba and E. salmonophloia), 
 Figure 4 Moisture content repartition within E. camaldulensis and E.saligna trees 
 Figure 5 Location and definition of juvenile wood, heartwood, transition wood and sapwood Finally, the large differences obser ved between minimal and maximal values of D b , D m0 and Dm 12 in E. saligna, could be explained by the lower density of its juvenile wood than those of its sapwood. 
 Shrinkage and shape factors Shrinkage analyses shows the volumetric (βv), tangential (βt), radial (βr), longitudinal (βv) shrinkages and shape factor (βt βr -1 ) values of E. camaldulensis and E. saligna  (Figure 6) . These results showed clearly that E. camaldulensis wood is more sensitive to moisture content variations than E. saligna wood. Indeed, the average value of shape factor of E. camaldulensis (2.16) was higher than those of E. saligna (1.81). The volumetric, tangential and radial shrinkage average values of E. camaldulensis and E. saligna were 25.2 and 22.1% (βv), 17.9 and 14.5% (βt), 8.1% and 7.9% (βr), respectively. The E. camaldulensis and E. Saligna were classified as wood with a high volumetric shrinkage (βv > 13%), a high tangential shrinkage (βt > 10%) and a high radial shrinkage (βr > 6.5%). According to the literature, shrinkage of Tunisian E. camaldulensis and E. saligna woods are relatively close to those of other Eucalyptus species such as E. loxophleba (βt βr -1 = 2.5) and E. salmonophloia (βt βr -1 = 1.2) from Tunisia, E. globulus (βt βr -1 = 1.6) from Morocco, E. citrodiora (βt βr -1 = 1.43) and E. grandis (βt βr -1 = 1.64) from Brazil and E. torquata (βt βr -1 = 1.27) from Tunisia  (Segura 2007 , El Alami 2013 , Sahbani 2014 , Selmi 2014 , Dridi 2015 , Elaieb et al. 2017 ). 
 Influence of steam pre-treatment on wood properties In some Eucalyptus species, wood shrinkage is often preceded by collapse phenomenon  (Sesbou and Nepveu 1978) . Previous studies highlighted shrinkage variations of Eucalyptus wood species occurring above the wood fiber saturation point  (Elaieb et al. 2017 ). This trend is probably due to wood collapse reaction. Indeed, collapse of the cells during drying is commonly observed in certain timber species and is particularly pronounced in some members of the genus Eucalyptus  (Berry and Roderick 2005) . Collapse is defined as a form of irregular shrinkage occurring above the fiber saturation point  (Assouad 2004 , Tazrout et al. 2012 . The most common explanation for collapse is capillary tension. One of the causes of collapse is that the cell walls cannot withstand the surface tension of the water that is removed from the lumen of the fibers. On the other hand, macroscopic stresses arising in the wood during drying have been suspected to contribute to collapse, and have been claimed by some workers to be the sole cause of the phenomenon  (Greenhill 1938, Stamm and Loughborough 1942) . However, literature also acknowledges that collapse can occur below the fiber saturation point  (Almeida et al. 2008) . Because of the natural propensity to internal checking, collapse and a high transverse shrinkage, the Eucalyptus wood grade recovery, after industrial drying, is generally low  (Haslett 1988) . Anecdotal industrial experience suggests that Eucalyptus woods recovery after industrial drying could be as low as 20-30% for the thicker sawn sizes  (Ananias et al. 2014) . Unacceptable internal checking and collapse after drying was also reported in scientific literature for Eucalyptus wood  (Ananias et al. 2009 ). This internal checking and collapse make the commercialisation of some Eucalyptus solid wood products unviable for the moment. The steaming of wood is a technique which has been employed, for several years, for a variety of purposes in the conversion and utilisation of forest products, including reconditioning of collapse-prone species  (Tieman 1929 , Greenhill 1938 . Through such steam treatment process, wood absorb a small amount of moisture and resume its initial shape which decreases the effect of collapse. While such applications are valuable in improving wood utilisation, steaming has disadvantages in that it may reduce the strength of the wood  (Campbell 1961 , Rosen and Laurie 1983 , Stubenvoll 1985  and increase shrinkage, collapse and checking susceptibility during drying  (Greenhill 1938 , Kauman 1961 , Liang 1981 , Haslett and Kininmonth 1986 . Nevertheless, there remains some disagreement with respect to the effect of pre-steaming on shrinkage and associated degrade.  Figure 6  shows that the mean values of shrinkage in pre-streaming conditioned E. camaldulensis and E. saligna wood were lower than those of control specimens. However, the dispersion of pre-treated woods shrinkages was wider than those from control samples, which does not highlight that steam pre-treatment has a significant effect on wood physical properties. In addition, according to IRCs indicators, E. saligna seems to be more sensible to collapse than E. camaldulensis. In fact, whatever the wood direction, IRC values from E. saligna wood shrinkage was higher than those from E. camaldulensis wood shrinkage. The results confirmed those obtained by previous studies on other Eucalyptus wood species.  Ananias et al. (2014)  highlighted that shrinkage before reconditioning and collapse of E. regnans wood showed highly significant increases in pre-steamed material with the exception of sapwood, but shrinkage after reconditioning was not significantly changed by pre-steaming for any data group.  Campbell (1961)  reported that steaming treatments of 2 to 4 h duration increase drying rates considerably without increasing the incidence of collapse. Further, in E. delegatensis shrinkage before reconditioning and shrinkage after reconditioning (2-4 h steaming) were not significantly different from controls  (Campbell 1961) . Unlike  Haslett and Kininmonth (1986) , who observed unacceptable levels of internal or surface checking after 2 h of pre-steaming in Nothofagus fusca,  Campbell (1961)  observed less checking in E. obliqua after pre-steaming, although collapse was greater. In oak,  Lee and Jung (1985)  found fewer end checks and slightly less collapse and honeycombing after 4 h of presteaming at 100 °C than in control specimens. A number of hypotheses have been advanced to account for changes in wood properties due to steam pre-treatment: (i) Changes in chemical bonding among cell wall constituents or heat degradation are notably by lignin and hemicelluloses and changes in wood extractives  (Kauman 1961 , Kininmonth 1971 , Kubinsky 1971 , Salud 1976 , McGinnes and Rosen 1984  (ii) In terms of liquid tension theor y, the preconditions for collapse development are high impermeability, water-saturated 
 Figure 7 Average values of basic density (Db) and indicator of collapse recovery (ICR) of E. camaldulensis and E. saligna before (with collapse) and after conditioning (without collapse) cell lumens and relatively weak cell walls  (Tiemann 1915 ). An increase in wood permeability together with a reduction in initial moisture content should produce a reduction in collapse. This decrease in moisture content in presteamed material was interpreted as reflecting changed permeability, likely responsible for the changed level in residual collapse of pre-steamed material  (Ananias et al. 2014 ). 
 Density As found by shrinkage properties determination, Db measurements of untreated and steam pretreated E. Saligna and E. camaldulensis woods showed higher sensitivity to collapse of E. saligna compared to those of E. camaldulensi. These results were consistent with previous studies which reported that collapse in Eucalyptus wood species tend to be higher when density of wood is lower (Kingston and Risdon 1961,  Ananias et al. 2009 ).  Chafe (1986)  recognised that collapse increases proportionally to the increase in green moisture content and reduction in basic density.  Figure 7  shows that the mean loss in density after steam pre-treatment of E. saligna (= 0.09) is higher than for E. camaldulensis (= 0.01). Although statistically not significant, it was   
 Mechanical properties The mechanical test results of E. saligna and E. camaldulensis woods conditioned at a temperature of 20 °C and 65% RH are shown in   (Collardet and Besset 1998) . The lower mechanical properties of E. saligna and E. camaldulensis woods than those of other Eucalyptus wood species from Tunisia could be due to their higher sensitivity to collapse and lower density. 
 CONCLUSION The study focused on the physical and mechanical properties of north-western E. saligna and E. camaldulensis woods issued from Zarniza arboretum of the Sejnane region. The study was conducted on three trees each of Eucalyptus wood species from one geographical location. However, the results obtained cannot be generalised. Both species of Eucalyptus had lower physical and mechanical properties than other Eucalyptus wood in Tunisia and other countries such as Brazil, Australia and Morocco, probably due to their sensitivity to collapse phenomenon. Due to collapse reactions, E. saligna and E. camaldulensis remain lowly exploited by lumber manufacturing industr y in Tunisia, for the development of commercial solid wood products. The steam pre-treatment technique was found effective in recovering much of the collapse. It could be advantageously applied in Tunisia and other countries with Eucalyptus industries for better valorisation of ligneous products. This study showed that steam pre-treatment of E. saligna and E. camaldulensis could improve wood properties and allow them to be used as material to produce flooring, interior joinery, furniture, glulam and light frame for wood construction, in Tunisia.

 Elaieb MT et al. 166 © Forest Research Institute Malaysia carried out on 165 samples for both wood species, E. camaldulensis and E. saligna. 
 Table 1 1 gives the minimal, maximal and average values of initial moisture contents of E. camaldulensis and E. saligna trees at 1.40 m from the ground, just after felling. On average, the initial moisture contents were 75.14% for E. camaldulensis wood and 87.27% for E. saligna wood, with respective minimal values of 59.80% and 36.95% and maximal values of 122.65% and 116.71%. The moisture content of both eucalyptus wood species were relatively close. In comparison with other Eucalyptus species, moisture content of E. camaldulensis and E. saligna were similar to those found in close geographical locations. Sahbeni (2014) found initial moisture content values of 82.9% and 101.5% for E. bicostata and E. coriacea woods from Souniat arboretum in Tunisia. Even if these trees grew and were felled in similar conditions with those of the present study, moisture content comparison is still needed. Elaieb et al. (2017) highlighted that moisture content of fresh felled E. loxophleba and E. salmonophloia in Northeast Tunisia were 37.1% and 37.8%, respectively. However, the initial eucalyptus wood moisture can be largely variable. Ananias et al. (2014) found wood initial moisture content ranging from 132 to 200% for different E. nitens trees from Las Mellizas site in Rucamanque farm, located near the city of Huepil in the eighth region of Chile.

 that Eucalytus wood basic density was between 0.690 and 0.940 g cm -3 . In Tunisia, studies on wood characterisation were conducted in the past two years on localEucalptus wood species: E. bicostata, E. cinerea, E. coriacea, E. maidenii, E. torquata and more recently on E. loxophleba and E. salmonophloia woods (Selmi et al. 2014, Dridi 2015, Elaieb et al. 2017). The respective basic densities of these wood species are 0.630, 0.619, 0.711, 0.691, 0.870, 0.860 and 0.894 g cm -3 . Comparing the results from the current study with those from other Tunisians Eucalyptus species, E. camaldulensis and E. saligna seem to be classified among the lightest Tunisian Eucalyptus woods.

 Basic density: indicator of collapse recovery(ICR)    obser ved that steam pre-treatment slightly decreased D b for both Eucalyptus wood species. This decrease in density could be explained by the removal of extractives and low degradation of hemicelluloses. However, according to results, disparity and lower mean value of IRC (positive and negative values around 0.0), steam pretreatment does not significantly affect the D b of E. saligna and E. camaldulensis.

 Table 3 . 3 The MOR average values of E. camaldulensis and E. saligna woods were respectively 80.01 MPa and 53.75 MPa in bending and 39.62 MPa and 31.72 MPa in compression. Previous studies show that E. camaldulensis and E. saligna wood species can be classified as having medium (55 MPa < σc < 75 MPa) and low (σb < 75 MPa) static bending strength respectively, and low axial compressive strength (σc < 45 MPa) (Collardet and Besset 1998). In comparison with literature, the results of E. saligna and E. camaldulensis woods had lower bending and compression strength properties than other Tunisian Eucalyptus species. Ghodhbéne (2014) characterised Tunisian E. cinerea and E. maidenii wood and found bending strength values of 132.5 MPa and 107.2 MPa, and compression strength values of 54 MPa and 48.7 MPa. Sahbani (2014) found similar results for E. bicostata with a compression strength value of 50.40 MPa. Elaieb et al., (2017) showed that MOR average values of Tunisian E. loxophleba and E. salmonophloia woods were 95.8 MPa and 97.2 MPa in bending test and 56.3MPa and 56.9 MPa in compression test, respectively. Thus, the species is classified as having high static bending strength and medium/high axial compressive strength

Members of the genus cause disease on at least 124 monocots and 268 dicots and provide excellent case studies for the understanding of molecular plant-microbe interactions  [1] . Leaf scald caused by X. albilineans is an important disease that can have considerable economic impact on sugarcane industries worldwide  [2] . X. albilineans colonizes the vascular system of sugarcane leaves and stalks, but is also capable of infecting the parenchyma cells of sugarcane, a unique characteristic differing from other bacterial pathogens with a reduced genome  [3] . This bacterial pathogen induces various leaf and stalk symptoms during disease progress  [2] . In the initial phase of the disease, X. albilineans causes the appearance of white, narrow, sharply defined leaf stripes which is followed by necrosis and wilting of infected leaves, thus resulting in plant death  [4, 5] . In mature and diseased stalks, side shoots develop along the stalk from the node buds and basal side shoots are always more developed than those higher up  [2, 4] . X. albilineans produces the toxin albicidin, which has phytotoxic and antibiotic properties. Albicidin is a potent DNA gyrase inhibitor that inhibits chloroplast DNA replication and blocks chloroplast differentiation, thus resulting in the white stripe and chlorotic symptoms on infected leaves  [6] . A high genetic diversity has been reported among worldwide strains of X. albilineans that are currently distributed in three serovars and six lysovars. Serovar I includes isolates from Australia, Mauritius, South Africa, Guadeloupe, India, and the United States. Serovar II consists of isolates from African countries, and serovar III contains isolates from the Caribbean Islands (Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint-Kitts), Sri Lanka, and Fiji  [7, 8] . The serological variability of X. albilineans has been confirmed using a combination of monoclonal antibodies and DNA fingerprinting with 38 strains of the pathogen from various geographical locations  [9] . At least 10 genetic groups (PFGE-A to PFGE-J) have been described using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and by multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA)  [10, 11] . However, our previous studies showed that the genetic diversity of X. albilineans from China is very low. MLSA analysis of 14 strains from this country revealed that they belong to the PFGE group B, based on five housekeeping genes  [12, 13] . With the advent of sequencing technologies, genome sequence data can help to resolve the phylogeny among the strains of X. albilineans by considering mutation and recombination at the whole-genome level  [14] . The complete genome sequence has been determined for several Xanthomonas species, making these bacteria attractive models to study plant-pathogen interactions at the molecular level. Comparative studies have also improved our understanding of the genome features of various bacterial pathogens. For example, the full genome sequence of X. albilineans strain GPE PC73 from Guadeloupe lacks the hrp genes encoding a type III secretion system (T3SS) present in almost all gram negative plant pathogenic bacteria  [11, 15] . Moreover, X. albilineans experienced a reduced genome evolution in comparison to other sequenced plant pathogenic xanthomonads. This bacterial species is phylogenetically close to Xylella fastidiosa, another xylem-invading pathogen with a reduced genome and that is also missing an hrp T3SS  [15, 16] . Phylogenetic analyses with rRNA sequences excluded X. fastidiosa from the Xanthomonas group, but phylogenetic analysis with X. albilineans genomic sequences suggested that X. fastidiosa belongs to the Xanthomonas group  [15] . So far, genome sequencing has been reported for 15 worldwide strains of X. albilineans, including 14 strains with scaffolds, using the Illumina technique, and one strain (GPE PC73) using the Sanger technique  [11, 15] . This genomic information appears to be very useful to explore the biological characteristics of X. albilineans, the reductive genome features, and the intra-species genetic diversity of this pathogen. The aforementioned strains did not include any strain from China, where several outbreaks of sugarcane leaf scald were recently reported  [12, 17, 18] . Therefore, to better understand the genome features of X. albilineans between China and other counties, we generated the complete genome without gaps of a representative strain from China (Xa-FJ1)  [12]  using the PacBio RSII and Illumina HiSeq PE150 platforms. The genome of this strain was compared to the genome of the other sequenced worldwide strains of X. albilineans, particularly with the complete genome of strain GPE PC73 from Guadeloupe. 
 Materials and Methods 
 Isolation of Bacteria and DNA Preparation X. albilineans strain Xa-FJ1 was isolated from a leaf section originating from a diseased sugarcane plant of clone YG48 collected at Zhangzhou, Fujian Province, China  [12] . A pure culture of this strain was grown with constant shaking at 200 rpm and 28 °C for 48 h in XAS liquid medium  [19] . Bacterial genomic DNA was extracted from cultures of Xa-FJ1 using the SDS method  [20] . Extracted genomic DNA was subjected to quality control by agarose gel electrophoresis and quantified using the Qubit v.2.0 fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). 
 Genome Sequencing and Assembly Whole-genome sequencing was performed using the PacBio RSII platform  [21]  and Illumina Hiseq platform at Beijing Novogene Bioinformatics Technology Co., Ltd. A 10-Kb DNA library was constructed using the SMRT bell TM Template kit v.1.0, according to the manufacturer's instructions, and sequenced using single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology. A 350 bp sequencing library was prepared with NEBNext ® Ultra™ DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs (Beijing) LTD, Beijing, China) in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations, and sequenced on Illumina Hiseq platform with a 2 × 150 bp paired-end sequencing kit. After quality control of the sequencing data, clean reads from the PacBio platform were assembled de novo with the SMRT Link v.5.0.1 software (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA) using the hierarchical genome assembly process (HGAP)  [22] . The assembly results were further corrected with Illumina data using the bwa software (https://sourceforge.net/projects/bio-bwa/). The complete sequence of the genome of X. albilineans strain Xa-FJ1 has been deposited at GenBank under the accession number CP046570-CP046571. 
 Genome Component Prediction and Gene Annotation Putative open reading frames (ORF) were predicted using the GeneMarkS v.4.17 program  [23]  (http://topaz.gatech.edu/GeneMark/). Transfer RNA (tRNA) genes were predicted with tRNAscan-SE  [24] . Ribosome RNA (rRNA) genes were analyzed using rRNAmmer  [25] . Small RNAs (sRNA) were predicted by BLAST against the Rfam database  [26, 27] , and confirmed using the cmsearch program (version 1.1rc4) with default parameters. Gene annotations were determined with the BLASTP program (E-value < 1 ×10 −5 , identity ≥ 40%, coverage ≥ 40%) and six databases including GO (gene ontology)  [28] , KEGG (Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes)  [29, 30] , COG (clusters of orthologous groups)  [31] , NR (non-redundant protein databases)  [32] , TCDB (transporter classification database)  [33] , and Swiss-Prot  [34] . Genome overview was created by Circos to show the annotation information  [35] . The secretory proteins were predicted with SignalP (version 4.1, http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP-4.1/)  [36]  and TMHMM (Version 2.0c, http://www.mybiosoftware.com/tmhmm-2-0c-prediction-transmembrane-helices-proteins.html). Since X. albilineans is a bacterial pathogen, pathogenicity and drug resistance data were also retrieved from the pathogen-host interactions database (PHI-base)  [37] , the virulence factors of pathogenic bacteria database (VFDB)  [38] , and the antibiotic resistance genes database (ARDB)  [39] . Carbohydrate-active enzymes were predicted using the carbohydrate-active enzymes database  [40] . CRISPRs were identified using CRISPRdigger (version 1.0, https://github.com/greyspring/CRISPRdigger)  [41] . 
 Average Nucleotide Identity and Phylogenetic Analysis The genome sequences of 15 worldwide strains of X. albilineans and one strain of Xanthomonas pseudalbilineans (used as outgroup) were retrieved from NCBI  (Table S1 ). The average nucleotide identities of these 16 strains and strain Xa-FJ1 sequenced in this study were calculated by pairwise genome comparison based on BLAST+ with JSpeciesWS (http://jspecies.ribohost.com/jspeciesws/)  [42, 43] . Core genes and specific genes of the 16 strains of X. albilineans were analyzed using the CD-HIT rapid clustering of similar proteins software with a threshold of 50% pairwise identity, and 0.7 length difference cut off of amino acids  [32, 44, 45] . Gene sequences were aligned pairwise and sequence redundancies were removed using the BLAST option of the solar software  [46] . The gene family clustering was based on the alignment results using Hcluster-sg software (https://github.com/douglasgscofield/hcluster). A phylogenetic tree, based on 2341 core genes conserved across the 16 strains of X. albilineans, was constructed using the neighbor-joining method and 1000 bootstrap replications with TreeBeST (http://treesoft.sourceforge.net/treebest.shtml). 
 Comparative Genomic Analysis Chromosome alignment between strains Xa-FJ1 and GPE PC73 of X. albilineans was performed using MUMmer version 3.22  [47]  and LastZ version 1.02.00 tools  [48, 49] . Scattered comparison results were linked into longer forms by the chainNet package. Structural variations (SV) like translocation, inversion and trans + inverse relationships in the comparison blocks were identified according to arrange relationships and relative orientations. The results were visualized using Circos (http://circos.ca/)  [35] . 
 Results 
 General Genomic Features of X. albilineans Strain Xa-FJ1 A total of 775 Mb PacBio clean data (N50 read length of 15,957 bp, quality of 0.84; average read length of 10,889 bp) was generated with an estimated 206× average depth of sequencing coverage. Preliminary assembly was conducted with SMRT Link v.5.0.1 and corrected by the variant Caller module. The assembly result was further corrected with 2141 Mb Illumina clean data (89.99% of bases with quality score >30) using bwa. This genome was assembled into one circular chromosome of 3,724,581 bp (  Figure S1A ) and one single plasmid of 31,536 bp (  Figure S1B ). This chromosome contained 3176 predicted genes with an average gene length of 1016 bp. The genome of strain GPE PC73-the only other X. albilineans strain with a complete genome sequence in NCBI-contained 3115 putative genes with an average length of 1059 bp  (Table 1) . Besides the circular chromosome, one plasmid was present in strain Xa-FJ1 but strain GPE PC73 had three plasmids. The nucleotide sequence of the plasmid of strain Xa-FJ1 shared 99.91% identity with PlasmII of strain GPE PC73  (Table S2) .  
 Functional Annotation of the Predicted Genes of X. albilineans Strain Xa-FJ1 Gene annotation was performed with 11 different databases  (Table S3 ). Genes involved in metabolism pathways were significantly enriched based on GO, KEGG, and COG databases. Among the 24 subcategories of biological processes of the GO database, the largest category of Xa-FJ1 was assigned to metabolic process (1186 genes) (  Figure S2 ). Using KEGG annotation, 1491 of 2987 annotated genes were involved in metabolism, especially the metabolic pathways belonging to global and overview maps (529 genes) (  Figure S3 ). Amino acid transport and metabolism was ranked the third largest category among the 25 classes of functional categories of the COG database (  Figure S4 ). A total of 279 putative virulence-associated factors were identified based on the VFDB database, including 53 flagella-related genes, 27 genes related to type IV pili, and 35 genes related to different secretion systems  (Table S4) . Genes potentially involved in pathogenicity of Xa-FJ1 were also identified by blasting the pathogen-host interactions database (PHI-base) (  Figure 1  and  Table S3 ). Among the 179 genes with homologous sequences in the PHI-base, 23 shared homologs with infection-related genes in pathogenic fungi such as Magnaporthe oryzae. Eighty-one and 75 genes were homologous to virulence factors characterized in bacteria pathogenic to animals and plants, respectively. Fifty three of the 75 bacterial virulence factors with hit in Xa-FJ1 were from Xanthomonas spp. Six Xa-FJ1 genes, homologous to sequences essential for full virulence in plant pathogenic bacteria, were XaFJ1_GM001161 (rsmA in X. oryzae), XaFJ1_GM001582 (galU in X. campestris), XaFJ1_GM001983 (pstB in X. citri), XaFJ1_GM002139 (rpoN in Erwinia amylovora), XaFJ1_GM002197 (vrpA in X. citri), and XaFJ1_GM002596 (hrpM in X. citri). In particular, the quorum sensing (QS) signal molecule Ax21 of X. oryzae pv. oryzae was retrieved from the PHI-base. Thirteen genes belonging to four operons (raxSTAB, raxPQ, raxRH and phoPQ) that are supposed to be required for the well-known effector Ax21 activity in X. oryzae pv. oryzae were also identified in X. albilineans strain Xa-FJ1  (Table S3 ). Four copies of raxB (XaFJ1_GM001779, XaFJ1_GM001890, XaFJ1_GM001891, XaFJ1_GM002569) were included, but raxA and raxST were not retrieved from the PHI-base. XaFJ1_GM000725 was homologous to gene raxC outside the raxSTAB locus in X. oryzae pv. oryzae, and may encode the outer membrane component of the type I secretion system. The retrieved genes of Xa-FJ1 also contained three copies of raxR (XaFJ1_GM000629, XaFJ1_GM000871, XaFJ1_GM002789) and one raxH ortholog (XaFJ1_GM000872), which form twocomponent regulatory systems. XaFJ1_GM000222 and XaFJ1_GM000223 were related to the operon phoP/phoQ of X. oryzae, which is involved in reduction and increase of virulence. XaFJ1_GM002301 and XaFJ1_GM002300 were present in an operon that corresponds to the operon raxP/raxQ of X. oryzae, which is involved in Ax21 tyrosine sulfation.  
 Average Nucleotide Identity and Phylogenetic Analysis among Strains of X. albilineans Average nucleotide identity (ANI) analysis was conducted with the full-length genome sequence of Xa-FJ1 and 15 other strains of X. albilineans and one strain of X. pseudalbilineans (GPE 39) (  Figure 2  and  Table S1 ). ANI varied from 97.84-99.98%% among the 16 worldwide strains of X. albilineans. These strains shared 89.54-89.91% ANI with strain GPE 39 of X. pseudalbilineans. Strain Xa-FJ1 from China had 97.89-99.97% ANI with the 15 other strains of X. albilineans in the NCBI database. Strain Xa-FJ1 had the highest identity (≥99.79%) with four strains from the French West Indies (GPE PC73, GPE PC17, GPE PC86 from Guadeloupe and MTQ032 from Martinique), and one strain from the USA (XaFL07-1). The 16 strains of X. albilineans were distributed into three distinct clades of a phylogenetic tree based on the core-genome (2341 genes) of these strains. Strain Xa-FJ1 from China was assigned to a specific branch or sub-group of clade III that also included four strains from the French West Indies (GPE PC73, GPE PC17 and GPE PC86 from Guadeloupe, and MTQ032 from Martinique) and one strain from the USA (XaFL07-1)  (Figure 3 ). Strain REU174 from Reunion Island, and strain LKA070 from Sri Lanka, were also assigned to clade III but were located in two other sub-groups. Clade II was formed by three strains from Africa (GAB266, HVO082, and HVO005) and one strain, REU209, from Reunion Island, an island off the coast of East Africa. Clade I contained four strains: One from Fiji (FJI080), one from Papua New Guinea (PNG130), and two from the USA (USA048 and Xa23R1).   
 Chromosomal Structural Variation Between Strains Xa-FJ1 and GPE PC73 of X. albilineans GPE PC73 was one of the closest strains to Xa-FJ1 and, as mentioned above, was the only X. albilineans strain with a complete genome sequence in the NCBI. Comparative analysis of the chromosomes between Xa-FJ1 and GPE PC73 identified 16 structural variations that were linked to various insertion/deletions (InDels, R1~R16) (  Figure 4  and  Table 2 ). In comparison to strain Xa-FJ1, the chromosome of strain GPE PC73 contained an insertion from position 219,691 bp to 271,791 bp (52,101 bp in R1 region). This region included 72 specific genes in the genome of strain GPE PC73 that were absent in strain Xa-FJ1  (Table 2 and Table S5 ). A plasticity zone (about 7 Kb long) of the chromosome of strains Xa-FJ1 and GPE PC73 had low similarity (40.26%) between the two strains and consisted of four InDels (R5, R6, R7, and R8). Five InDel fragments were flanked by repetitive sequences. Three of them (R3, R4 and R9) were expected to be involved in synthesis of the AMP-binding super family domain of a non-ribosomal peptide synthase. The other two InDel fragments were located at position 679,518 bp to 681,202 bp (R2) in strain Xa-FJ1, and 2,532,506 bp to 2,535,350 bp (R10) in strain GPE PC73, and were predicted to encode hypothetical proteins and a putative methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein, respectively.    Figure 4 ). 
 Region Xa InDel fragments at position R11 and R16 contained XaFJ1_GM002292 and XaFJ1_GM002989, respectively, and are expected to encode putative transposases. Homologous sequences occurred on both sides of XaFJ1_GM002292 and XaFJ1_GM002989, resulting in the similarity of adjacent genes. In contrast, no homologous sequence was found on either side of insertion fragment R12 at loci XALc_2603 and XALc_2604 of strain GPE PC73, although these two genes were also associated to transposases. In addition, R12 had the same sequence as loci XALc_1241-XALc_1245 that were associated to replicative transposition. A sequence variation at position 3.4 Mb (R13-R15) between strains Xa-FJ1 and GPE PC73 included clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), downstream of CRISPR-associated protein 2 (cas2 gene). Like the genome of GPE PC73, the genome of strain Xa-FJ1 contained two CRISPR/cas systems: CRISPR-1 and CRISPR-2. The CRISPR-2 system was 100% identical between the two strains and the CRISPR-1 system shared 76.77% identity between Xa-FJ1 and GPE PC73 (  Figure S5 ). The CRISPR-1 system of GPE PC73 is associated with seven cas genes and contains thirty-four 31-base pair repeats and thirty-three 33-to 38-base pair spacers  [11] . The nucleotide sequence of the three spacers of the trailer end  (33, 32, 31)  varied between strains Xa-FJ1 and GPE PC73. Genome variations R13-R15 between the two strains corresponded to seven spacers of CRISPR-1 that were present in only one of the two strains (  Figure S5 ). 
 Chromosomal Specific Genes between Strain Xa-FJ1 and Strain GPE PC73 of X. albilineans Of the 3176 putative protein-coding sequences (CDSs) manually annotated on the chromosome of X. albilineans strain Xa-FJ1, 2998 hit in the CDSs of strain GPE PC73, and another 178 hit in the chromosomal sequence of strain GPE PC73, which were not annotated as CDSs due to different prediction methods. Only 10 predicted CDSs were specific to strain Xa-FJ1 from China  (Table 3) , nine of which (XaFJ1_GM001517~XaFJ1_GM001525) were located in the plasticity zone (R5-R8,  Figure 4  and  Table 3 ). Six genes were associated with hypothetical proteins. XaFJ1_GM001517 was predicted to encode a protein involved in synthesis of the zona occludens toxin (Zot). XaFJ1_GM001523 was expected to code for a DNA-binding protein homologous to the one from Xanthomonas phage phiLf. The protein encoded by XaFJ1_GM001524 was similar to the replication initiation protein from X. translucens. Thus, these genes might be acquired as prophage. The last specific gene (XaFJ1_GM002989) was located far away from the plasticity zone, and was predicted to encode a transposase with an ATP-binging function (R16).  Table 3 . Putative function of the 10 genes of the chromosome of X. albilineans strain Xa-FJ1 from China that were not present in the genome of strain GPE PC73 from Guadeloupe.

Strain GPE PC73 had an insertion region of 52 kb (R1,  Figure 4 ) that contained 72 genes specific to GPE PC73  (Table S5 ). Among these, 53 genes had no predicted function and were considered hypothetical proteins (including one hypothetical secreted protein). Fifteen genes were annotated as hypothetical phagerelated proteins, including XALc_0206 (hypothetical phage terminase large subunit protein) and XALc_0242 (putative phage integrase protein). The other four genes in the R1 region were predicted to be two putative N6 adenine-specific DNA methyltransferase proteins (XALc_0178 and XALc_0231), one putative DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase protein (XALc_0203), and one hypothetical DNA methyltransferase protein (XALc_0202). The 10 specific genes in the plasticity zone of GPE PC73 (R5-R8) included genes predicted to code for three hypothetical phage-related proteins (XALc_1539, XALc_1543 and XALc_1544), one putative filamentous phage cf1c related protein (XALc_1537), and one putative F pilin acetylation protein (XALc_1536). 
 Genes Present in Plasmids, PlasmI and PlasmIII, of Strain GPE PC73 of X. albilineans from Guadeloupe and Absent in Strain Xa-FJ1 from China The plasmid common to strain GPE PC73 (PlasmII) and strain Xa-FJ1 (pXaFJ1) shared 99.91% identity between the two strains, and differed by 29 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Two plasmids (PlasmI and PlasmIII) present in strain GPE PC73 were not found in Xa-FJ1. These two plasmids were predicted by the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline to encode 24 and 32 genes, respectively  (Table S6 ). As also reported by Pieretti et al.  [11] , PlasmI and PlasmIII each harbor an incomplete conjugal transfer system, referring to 12 genes and 11 genes, respectively. This system is considered as an important bacterial factor, helping bacterial adaptation to new hosts. Other genes of these two plasmids are predicted to code for proteins involved in replication and maintenance of plasmids such as plasmid partitioning proteins (XALp_3174, XALr_3236, and XALr_3237), plasmid stabilization system proteins (XALp_3179, XALp_3197, and XALr_3241) and the trans-acting replication initiator TrfA protein (XALr_3265). XALp_3176 of PlasmI has been annotated as a probable fic-family protein involved in adenylation of Rho-family GTPases. In PlasmIII, XALr_3238 is predicted to be a zinc metalloproteinase with a sprT domain that is a regulator of the bolA gene during the stationary phase. PlasmIII also harbors three genes (XALr_3245, XALr_3246, and XALr_3266) that putatively code for transcription regulator proteins. 
 Discussion In recent years, leaf scald of sugarcane has been reported with increasing frequency in five sugarcane-growing regions of China by PCR-based detection  [12, 17, 18] . Very low genetic diversity was found among strains of X. albilineans from China, based on sequence analysis of an ABC transporter gene (XALc_1791) and MLSA, suggesting recent spread in this country of a single strain (from genetic group PFGE-B) of the leaf scald pathogen  [12, 13] . Since 2009, 15 genome sequences of X. albilineans strains from 10 worldwide geographical locations have been deposited in GenBank with complete or scaffold sequences. Some genomic information is, however, not accessible for most of these strains because of incomplete sequences. No complete genome sequence of X. albilineans from China had been reported until now. Third-generation sequencing technology such as the PacBio system can help to resolve most of the assembly problems by providing long reads, low degree of bias and epigenetic classification  [50] . Furthermore, this sequencing platform is competent to determine sequences with tandem repeats, high/low G + C values, and interspersed repeated regions, compared to second-generation sequencing platforms  [50, 51] . In this study, the complete genome of a representative strain of X. albilineans from China (Xa-FJ1) was sequenced without gaps using the PacBio RSII technique and was corrected by Illumina data for higher consensus accuracy. The annotations performed with the GO, KEGG and COG databases indicated that a wide variety of metabolic related proteins were encoded by X. albilineans strain Xa-FJ1. These proteins included putative pectinesterase (XaFJ1_GM001902), cellulase (XaFJ1_GM000462) and xylose isomerase (XaFJ1_GM000104), and they were expected to be involved in active metabolic pathways for specific adaptation of this pathogen to the nutrient-poor xylem vessels. Among the 279 genes with homologous sequences in the VFDB database  (Table S4 ), 8 genes have been shown to affect pathogenicity of the causal agent of sugarcane leaf scald by transposon mutagenesis  [52] . The pathogen-host interactions database (PHI-base) collects gene phenotype and function data obtained by manual curation of the peer-reviewed literature  [37] . Among 179 genes retrieved from PHI-base, 39 genes had putative functions previously reported  [11, 52] . Moreover, 20 of these genes referred to two-component systems. Among the remaining 140 genes, 98 were associated with reduced virulence or loss of pathogenicity and 5 genes were annotated as effectors, including Ax21. As a quorum sensing signal molecule in X. oryzae, Ax21 regulates cell density-dependent expression of up to 489 genes  [53] . Thirteen genes involving four operons (raxSTAB, raxPQ, raxRH and phoPQ) were also identified in PHI-base, and these genes were associated with the activity of Ax21 in X. oryzae. Knockout mutants of these genes increased virulence (hypervirulence) to rice, except for phoP. Mutants of raxST, raxA, raxB or raxC from X. oryzae can evade XA21-mediated immunity to different degrees and induce disease lesions on rice expressing the XA21 receptor  [54] . Both raxH/raxR and phoP/phoQ serve as two-component regulatory systems which may sense Ax21 and activate downstream signaling  [53] . XaFJ1_GM002301 and XaFJ1_GM002300 from Xa-FJ1 are two genes corresponding to the operon raxP/raxQ of X. oryzae which is indispensable for the biological activity of Ax21 in the rice bacterial blight pathogen  [55] . The functions of Ax21 and Ax21-related rax genes in Xa-FJ1 need to be explored to determine their role in the virulence of X. albilineans. Based on complete sequence analysis, strain Xa-FJ1 from China shared high ANI with five strains of X. albilineans from the French West Indies (including GPE PC73 from Guadeloupe) and the USA (Florida). These six strains also clustered together in a phylogenetic tree based on the coregenome sequence of 16 strains of the pathogen. These results are congruent with those obtained in a previous study based on an ABC transporter gene (XALc_1791) and five housekeeping genes  [13] , suggesting a common evolutionary route for these six strains of X. albilineans. We hypothesized that the occurrence of X. albilineans in mainland China is linked to former frequent introductions of sugarcane germplasm and cultivars from Taiwan and foreign countries such as the USA, India, and Australia. These introductions occurred in order to enhance the local genetic diversity of parental clones in breeding programs during the 1980-1990s. Import of infected material has most likely occurred because X. albilineans can be present in cuttings collected from asymptomatic sugarcane, and the quarantine procedures used in China prior to 1990 were not as robust as they are nowadays  [12] . Virulence of X. albilineans strains (data from the literature detailed in  Table S1 ) was not correlated with distribution of the strains by ANI analysis. Strains with high ANI values showed great variation in virulence, suggesting that small genome differences (such as point mutations or small indels) were involved in variations of the virulence of X. albilineans. Additional virulence data are needed to further investigate the pathogenicity of X. albilineans and its relationship with adaption and evolution of this pathogen. Chromosomal structural variations between strains Xa-FJ1 and GPE PC73 suggested that homologous recombination and horizontal gene transfer were tightly associated to genome evolution of X. albilineans. Five variable regions (R2, R3, R4, R9 and R10,  Figure 4  and  Table 2 ) appear to be caused by homologous recombination because the sequences flanking the InDel sites are identical in both bacterial strains, and homologous recombination may have occurred during chromosome replication. Alternatively, these regions may have resulted from assembly errors of GPE PC73 because the five InDels have no specific meaning as they only create internal duplicated DNA regions  [56] . Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a common process responsible in prokaryotes for movement of genes from one organism to another, including antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factors  [57] . Based on genome analysis of multiple strains of a given bacterial species or different species, prophages are the main cause of bacteria's short-term intraspecies or interspecies diversity  [58] . In this study, two prophage integrations (R1 and R5-R8) resulted in the addition of different specific genes in the genomes of strains Xa-FJ1 and GPE PC73. Regions R1 and R5-8, differing between Xa-FJ1 and GPE PC73, contain four DNA methyltransferases and an F pilin acetylation protein in strain GPE PC73. Various lytic and lysogenic phages have been proven to encode multi-and mono-specific orphan methyltransferases that have the ability to confer protection from restriction endonucleases of their bacterial hosts  [59] . Gene XaFJ1_GM001517 of strain Xa-FJ1 (which is absent in GPE PC73) is predicted to encode the Zot protein (PD0928), which plays a role in pathogenicity of X. fastidiosa, suggesting a selective advantage for strain Xa-FJ1 from China  [60] . These proteins may contribute to variation in virulence of X. albilineans or adaptation to certain sugarcane cultivars. Strains Xa-FJ1 and GPE PC73 of X. albilineans have a smaller chromosome size  (3.8  Mb) than those of other Xanthomonas species sequenced so far (generally about 5 Mb). X. albilineans does not possess a Hrp-type III secretion system, indicating that the pathogenicity of this pathogen must rely on other virulence factors or secretory systems  [11] . Furthermore, X. albilineans possesses a T3SS system of the SPI-1 (for Salmonella Pathogenicity Island-1) injectisome family, which strongly suggests that this bacterial species also interacts with an unknown insect  [15, 61] . Zot protein acts like a physiological modulator that is used by animal pathogens, such as Vibrio cholerae and Neisseria meningitidis, to induce a reversible opening of tight junctions between cells and to increase the paracellular permeability in a non-toxic manner  [62] . Presence of this gene is further evidence of a possible association of X. albilineans with an animal host that remains to be identified. Transposable elements can also promote genome plasticity in bacterial genomes  [63] . Three regions (R11, R12 and R16) of the X. albilineans genome contained transposases that were different between Xa-FJ1 and GPE PC73. The two strains also differed by their CRISPR-Cas signatures. The CRISPR-Cas system is a prokaryotic immune system among bacteria and archaea that provides resistance to foreign genetic elements  [64] . Although strains Xa-FJ1 and GPE PC73 showed high ANI, these genomic features suggested rapid DNA adaptation of these trains during their evolution in different environments. Many Xanthomonas strains also carry extra-chromosomal circular DNA in the form of plasmids, which can offer a myriad of benefits to the bacterial host, like virulence traits and antibiotic resistance  [65] . Although strains Xa-FJ1 from China, and GPE PC73 from Guadeloupe had the closest evolutionary relationship, PlasmI and PlasmIII from GPE PC73 were absent in Xa-FJ1, thus suggesting that these DNA elements are not critical for basic virulence of the leaf scald pathogen, but might be essential for adaptation of X. albilineans to certain environments. The Fic (filamentation induced by cyclic AMP) domains are conserved from bacteria to humans. Fic domain proteins catalyze the addition of AMP, or 'adenylylation', of target host proteins  [66] . For example, the secreted antigen IbpA from Histophilus somni causes collapse of the host-cell actin cytoskeleton by AMPylation to modify the three mammalian Rho family GTPases  [67] . It remains to be determined whether XALp_3176 in PlasmI of GPE PC73 also assists X. albilineans to target the Rho-family GTPases in sugarcane. Lytic transglycosylases are bacterial enzymes that catalyze the non-hydrolytic cleavage of the peptidoglycan structures of the bacterial cell wall  [68] . They are ubiquitous in bacteria which take part in a series of astonishingly diverse biological processes, such as cell wall metabolism, detection of cell-wall-acting antibiotics, insertion of secretion systems and flagellar assemblies into the cell wall and pathogenesis of certain gram-negative bacteria  [69] . As a probable lytic transglycosylase protein, XALr_3249 in PlasmIII could be an attractive new target for the study of cell wall and virulence of X. albilineans in specific hosts. The importance of PlasmII shared by both strains also remains to be investigated. 
 Conclusions We reported the first complete genome of a strain of X. albilineans (Xa-FJ1) from China using the PacBio RSII and Illumina HiSeq platforms. ANI analysis revealed that strain Xa-FJ1 had the closest evolutionary relationships with five strains of the pathogen from the French West Indies and the USA (Florida), particularly with strain GPE PC73 from Guadeloupe. These strains of X. albilineans have been associated with the most recently reported outbreaks and/or aerial spread of leaf scald in China, Florida, several Caribbean Islands, and Cuba. Genome comparison analysis suggested that horizontal gene transfer and homologous recombination were tightly linked to genome evolution of X. albilineans. Our findings contribute additional genomic resources to further investigate the diversity and pathogenicity of the causal agent of sugarcane leaf scald.

They fulfil basic functions like ensuring food security, livelihoods (for rural populations), employment, and create economic values along value chains  [1] ,  [2] . On the other hand, AVCs can have major negative impacts on earth ecosystems (soil and water pollution, loss of biodiversity), climate (greenhouse gas emissions), resources depletion (fossil resources), and on human health (contaminated water and air)  [3] . Changes to reduce environmental impacts can be made at different levels of the AVC. See for instance Gerber et al.  [4] , on reducing the contribution of the livestock sector to climate change. The agro-industrial system is the main organisational model of AVCs in terms of the volume of food products sold  [5] . This system tends to spatially separate consumers and agricultural production  [6] . Today the cumulative distance between a product in the different steps in the AVC from production to delivery to the consumer can be trans-national or trans-continental. As a result, the people (consumers) who benefit from the first function provided by agriculture, food security, are no longer connected with main people (farmers) who produce the food and have major interactions with the environment  [1] . However, in recent decades, a change has been observed in consumer awareness that takes the form of a preference for shorter food chains, i.e. within a territory  [7] . This shift is reflected in the increasing number of direct sales channels, community-supported agricultural organisations, and the expansion of local and national labels  [8] . These alternative organisational models generally symbolise values like equity, food safety, quality, traceability and low environmental impact  [9] . A compromise is possible between the agroindustrial system and the alternative short integrated AVCs. It assumes a transition from pure agroindustrial systems to agro-industrial systems more anchored in the consumers' territory. But this transition faces two challenges: (i) the need for quantitative rational arguments to support the transition and to monitor progress in interactions between the AVC and the consumers' territory, and (ii) stakeholder empowerment and commitment. New frameworks are thus needed to analyse the complexity, to quantitatively assess the impacts of AVCs, and to help managers of private firms and policy makers to inform their decision making  [10] . Many indicators, indices, methods and tools to assess sustainability can be found in the literature  [11] ,  [12] . Environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) has distinguished itself in a rich literature by its ability to provide a holistic assessment of a given AVC. It is recognised to be one of the most advanced methodologies with clear and proven methodological guidelines  [13] . Several studies have been conducted to complete the ecological indicators provided by environmental LCA with socio-economic indicators to cover the different pillars of sustainable development and render the results more useful for decision making  [14] . Multi-criteria (ecological and socio-economic) assessment is still an open research field at the AVC level  [15] ,  [16] ,  [17] . Some emerging initiatives such as Value Chain Analysis for Development (VCA4D) † seek to assess the contribution of AVC to sustainable, inclusive growth and job creation. See for instance, works of Bennet et al.  [18]  analysing the beef AVC in Zimbabwe. However, as recalled by Jørgensen et al.,  [19]  and Petit et al.,  [17] , there is no consensual framework for such an assessment of AVCs. Moreover, the methods were combined rather than integrated, as there is no consistency in data inventory between the environmental and the socio-economic dimensions  [17] ,  [14] . The present paper precisely proposes a multidisciplinary framework aimed at effective integration of environmental LCA and the effect method. The effect method, developed by Chervel and Le Gall  [20] , is a cost-benefit analysis which uses inputoutput tables for socio-economic project appraisal. Based on the value added generated by the project, it is possible to characterise the redistribution of wealth to different firms within a territory, usually a country. When regional input-output tables are available, it is also possible to spatialise wealth distribution  [21] . Wealth can be translated into jobs, tax and capital which are useful socio-economic indicators to complement the ecological indicators provided by the environmental LCA. The effective integration of these two methods is a methodological challenge as they originate from two different scientific disciplines: environmental LCA from environmental engineering and the effect method from economics. Here, the framework is illustrated using a case study of a poultry meat AVC in a tropical island, Reunion Island, a French overseas department † Directorate General International Cooperation and Development of the European Commission (https://europa.eu/capacity4dev/value-chain-analysis-fordevelopment-vca4d-)  Figure 1 . The six-step framework used to assess the contribution of an Agrifood Value Chain (AVC) to sustainable development (green arrows a,b and c indicate feedback loops) located in the Indian Ocean close to Madagascar. Like in many isolated, narrow and densely populated territories, local decision makers have to make choices between low-cost food imports from agroindustrial systems versus more locally anchored food production systems that may generate more value locally. The poultry meat AVC is an interesting and complex study case because local production is based on large-scale imports of inputs (e.g. feed) and competes with meat imported from Europe. The study year we used was 2010. Given the local population's increasing concerns about environmental issues, mitigation measures up to 2020 were included in the scenarios. This paper discusses what lessons can be drawn from this case study for a broader use of the proposed framework, particularly in the tropics. 
 MATERIAL AND METHODS 
 The Proposed Methodological Framework 
 Six Main Steps Inspired by the methodological guidelines of environmental LCA, the proposed framework has six main steps  (Figure 1 ). The first two steps are framing the problem, i.e. performing a strategic analysis (step 1) to characterise the root territory and the environment of the AVC by considering both socioeconomic and ecological challenges. It also involves identifying salient stakeholders and their interactions (step 2) to define the perimeter of the study system, i.e. the system boundaries. The methods and indicators are selected next (step 3) and the improvement scenarios are then defined (step 4). Step 5 is the equivalent of life cycle inventory in environmental LCA  [13] , during which data are collected and calculations made for both ecological and socio-economic analyses and for both the existing system and for the scenarios to be explored. Step 6 is the multi-criteria evaluation of the baseline and improvement scenarios and their interpretation. 
 A Participatory and Iterative Approach The proposed framework was defined as iterative (feedback loops in  Figure 1 ) and as being at the core of a participatory process  [22] . The case study was carried out on the initiative of the focal firm. The focal firm marketed the final poultry products. It was a key decisional entity in the AVC we studied, as this food chain functioned on demand  [23] . The focal firm convinced other AVC stakeholders to take part in meetings and relayed our requests for information and for the data required for the sustainability assessment. The iterative participatory sustainability assessment process comprised six meetings over a three-year period (2011-2013). The two first meetings (year 1) aimed at framing the problem and making the initial selection of indicators (steps 1 to 3). The third meeting (year 1) aimed at defining the existing system (the AVC) and the improvement scenarios (steps 4 and 5). The first evaluation of the actual system (step 6) was presented at the fourth meeting (year 2), when discussions led to the reevaluation of the salient stakeholders (feedback loop a to step 2) and the selected indicators (feedback loop b to step 3 in  Figure 1 ). The two last meetings (year 3) mainly focussed on multi-criteria evaluation of the baseline and improvement scenarios (step 6). The redefinition of the improvement scenarios (feedback loop c to step 4 in  Figure 1 ) was undertaken between the two last meetings. 
 46 The stakeholders involved included the managers of the focal firm and its salient, i.e. relevant, suppliers. See section 2.3 below for the definition of these stakeholders. The range of stakeholders involved was wider in the first and the last meeting as these two meetings included the people listed above plus representatives of several institutions involved in local agricultural governance.  
 Strategic Analysis of the Territory A strategic analysis is needed to define the 'root territory', i.e. the territory in which the AVC mainly operates. The term 'territory' corresponds to a geographical area which seeks to aggregate intrinsic specificities at a certain scale to justify its uniqueness. According to Laganier et al.  [24] , these specificities are classified in three dimensions: identitarian, material and organizational. The goal of identifying a root territory and its specificities is to identify the key challenges facing the territory that need to be taken into consideration in the sustainability assessment. In our case study, Reunion Island was defined as the root territory. It is the territory in which most salient stakeholders of the AVC are located, particularly the focal firm. It is also the home territory of the community supplied by the poultry AVC studied here. The main results of the strategic analysis of the Reunion Island territory concerning the supply of poultry meat are summarized in  Table 1 . It explained the connections between territorial characteristics in Reunion Island, the functioning of the poultry AVC and key challenges in the territory or in the rest of the world. Employment in the local community, human health (linked to fuel consumption and particle emissions), dependence on fossil resources (energy in particular), and preservation of soils and fresh water were the main key challenges identified in collaboration with the stakeholders. Climate change was not mentioned, as the stakeholders' awareness of this challenge in 2010 was not as high as today and climate change is slower in the southern hemisphere than the northern hemisphere due to fewer human activities and a higher proportion of oceans  [25] . 
 Characterization of Stakeholders and Their Interactions The objective of this step is to define the system boundaries and to identify the stakeholders to be involved in the participatory process. The multiplicity and diversity of stakeholders and their interactions within the AVC calls for discernment to reduce complexity. In the following, we define several methods to select the salient stakeholders of a given AVC based on the degree of interactions among the stakeholders themselves and between the stakeholders and their environment. The methods we used differed depending on the socio-economic or ecological dimension. For the socio-economic dimension, the method also differed depending on the type of stakeholders considered. With reference to the stakeholder typology proposed by  [26] ,  [27] , three types of AVC stakeholders were distinguished: Suppliers, Competitors, and the Community (  Figure 2 ). 
 Suppliers AVC suppliers were defined beginning with the focal firm and moving upstream. The discriminatory criterion we used was the financial dependence (FD) of each supplier on its customers  [28] . The FD rate is the customer's supply costs spent on the supplier divided by the total supplier's turnover. Moving upstream, the FD of each supplier was calculated iteratively at each step. This step was an iterative process because one supplier can supply more than one firm in the AVC (for instance in our case study, the firm which produced the poultry feed supplied both breeders and broiler farmers,  Figure 2 ). Several thresholds were used to classify suppliers in three categories: (i) collaborators (FD≥70%), (ii) remaining salient suppliers (70>FD≥5%), and (ii) non-salient suppliers (FD<5%), i.e. more marginal suppliers (Appendix A). The collaborator category included the focal firm. All salient suppliers were assigned to a group of stakeholders, named AVC industrial network (AVCIN). 
 Competitors Recent applications of game theory principles  [29]  in social LCA were useful for identifying salient competitors. We used a systematic competitive model as suggested by Lagarde and Macombe  [30] . The range of competitors was limited to actors who supplied the same market with poultry meat as the main local AVC. The criteria used to classify salient and marginal competitors were the volumes of meat supplied to the territory, the market share in each local retail channel, and the capacity to expand in each retail channel in the next ten years (Appendix B). 
 Community The community is an important component of the socio-economic environment of the AVC. The socio-economic health of the community is essential for a firm's longevity, and any loss of value in the system which could affect the community needs to be identified. The employees and customers of the focal firm, of the suppliers, or of any competitor, create value in the neighbouring community which could be affected by decisions taken at the AVC level. These people are included in the community. The salient community corresponds to the consumers and employees of the salient suppliers and competitors identified above. For the ecological dimension, the criterion used was the relative importance of elementary flows (matter or energy consumption and pollutant emissions). To be consistent with the socio-economic analysis, we applied the same threshold (5%) to select the salient stakeholders who would have to be taken into consideration in the ecological assessment; i.e. stakeholders who contributed less than 5% of the environmental impacts were not considered as salient stakeholders and were excluded from the system boundaries (feedback loop a between steps 6 and 2,  Figure 1 ).  Figure 2  shows that the common part of the system boundary (area in green) included most salient stakeholders of the socio-economic analysis. The common part corresponds to all the on-farm stakeholders and a large proportion of the pre-farm and the post-farm processes included in the ecological analysis. Among the 1,041 firms involved in the AVC studied here, the analysis concentrated on 124 firms that were salient for the ecological assessment and on 139 firms that were salient for the socio-economic assessment. The competitors and the community are specific salient stakeholders for the socio-economic analysis whereas the background processes (except local transport by truck) are specific salient stakeholders for the ecological analysis.

Arrows represent flows of goods and services between stakeholders (flows of raw materials, energy and transport are not represented for the sake of readability). The area in blue is specific to the ecological analysis and the area in yellow is specific to the socio-economic analysis. The area in green is common to the two dimensions. A location criterion is given in parenthesis for each stakeholder of the AVC (R: Reunion Island, W: the rest of the world, F: mainland France, A: Argentina). 
 Selection of Indicators and Methods for Multi-criteria Assessment Methods and indicators were selected as representative of the key socio-economic and ecological challenges facing Reunion Island identified during the strategic analysis (see  Table 1 ). Some were directly proposed by involved stakeholders, such as job creation and fossil fuel depletion; the others were first proposed by researchers and then validated by the stakeholders. All these indicators were calculated using the Environmental LCA (for the ecological dimension) and the effect method (for the socio-economic dimension). The main methodological choices are summarized below. Other methodological choices and hypotheses are described by Thévenot et al.,  [31] ,  [32] . Job creation was the indicator chosen for the socio-economic dimension  (Table 1) . Employment generated by the AVC activities were spatialised (within the territory versus in the rest of the world) and was handled in three categories: (i) direct employment for collaborators, (ii) indirect employment for the remaining salient suppliers and the salient competitors, and (iii) employment induced, i.e. created for the community. These categories can be normalised as three challenges: employment in the AVC industrial network, competitors, and the community. Job units are expressed as national minimum wage equivalents (NMW-eq.), which corresponds to the annual minimum gross salary an employer is legally bound to pay its employees. In 2010, the French national minimum wage was €15,206/year. Nine impact categories were identified for the ecological dimension in the strategic analysis (  Table  1 ). The formation of particulate matter at the level of the island territory and human toxicity at the level of the rest of the world were the impact categories selected to represent effects on human health. At the level of the island territory, soil acidification was selected to represent the effect on ecosystem health. At the level of the rest of the world, fossil fuel depletion was selected for resources conservation, and freshwater ecotoxicity, freshwater eutrophication, marine ecotoxicity, marine eutrophication, and terrestrial ecotoxicity were selected to represent effects on ecosystem health. All these impacts were calculated using Simapro v 7.3.3 software  [33] . The ReCiPe Midpoint and Endpoint method were used to characterise substances for each impact category and to normalise them into three challenges: resources conservation, ecosystem health, and human health  [34] . Since the consumption patterns in Reunion Island are similar to those in Europe, we used the weighting set ""Europe ReCiPe H/H"" in the ReCiPe method  [35] . 
 Definition of Explored Scenarios The three explored scenarios had two components: context dynamics and improvement measures. The context dynamics were defined to simulate changes in the system under study, i.e. changes in the number and size of firms and in the flows between these firms. In our case study, the time horizon used for the analysis was ten years (2010-2020). The situation in 2010 was used as the baseline scenario (""2010""). The assumptions concerning changes in the context (scenario ""2020"") were expected population growth, the corresponding increase in the demand for poultry meat and changes in market shares among competitors. Poultry meat consumption per inhabitant in the preceding five-year period (2005-2010) was stable, so we assumed that consumption patterns would not change over the time horizon of the study. The share between the poultry AVC and its competitors was also assumed to remain unchanged over the study period, even when improvement measures were implemented. Improvement measures were defined to make it possible to evaluate their effectiveness in progressing towards sustainability. These measures were implemented individually and in combination, the latter being the case in the scenario ""2020_IS"". In our case study, with a view to eco-labelling in the future, stakeholders wanted to explore three mitigation options that included equipment upgrading, improving farm eco-efficiency and reducing transport distance for inputs. Equipment upgrading refers to (i) setting up a biogas plant to digest slaughterhouse wastes which were previously burned in an incinerator on Reunion Island; (ii) installing photovoltaic solar panels on the roof of the slaughterhouse. Farm eco-efficiency refers to improving the feed consumption efficiency of broiler farms, as in 2010, farm performances varied widely  [31] . Reduction of transport refers to the change in the country from which maize is imported. Maize represents more than 50% of the broilers' diet and is imported from Europe, i.e. from 10,000 km away, whereas closer countries in the Indian Ocean could supply Reunion Island. In this scenario, maize is imported from Mozambique instead of from Europe. It is assumed that both economic and political barriers have been overcome. 
 Data Collection Data sources differed depending on the nature of the data (for socio-economic or ecological assessment) and the type of stakeholder (collaborators, remaining salient suppliers, the community or competitors). 
 Data Needed for the Socio-economic Impact Assessment The revenue and expenditure account and the social report of each firm classified as a collaborator were used to calculate the direct employment generated by collaborators. The input-output tables for Reunion Island and France were used to calculate indirect and induced employment by other salient stakeholders (remaining salient suppliers, the community and competitors). These data were provided by the French national institute of statistics and economic studies  [36] ,  [37] ,  [38] . An input-output table is an aggregation of all regional or national firms' accounts. It is based on Leontief Input-Output analysis  [39] . The two input-output tables were modified to create new tables, from which the increase in local value and the intermediate imports for each activity sector can be deduced when there is an increase in final demand  [40] ,  [32] . For the community, the statistics on household consumption  [41] ,  [37]  were broken down into modified inputoutput tables to calculate the effect on induced employment generated by the expenditure corresponding to the collaborators' and suppliers' employees' wages. Concerning competitors, the salient competitors' turnover and their market share were calculated using the estimated volumes of meat supplied and market prices (Appendix B). The market share equivalent to the meat volumes in competition with the AVC were broken down into the modified input-output tables to estimate employment that could be lost. 
 Data Needed to Assess the Environmental Impacts Based on the collaborators' expenditure accounts, the same economic flows used for the socio-economic analysis were converted into elementary flows for the environmental LCA. Based on unit prices, economic flows were first converted into flows of goods and services and then combined with material flow accounting and air pollutant emission reports to calculate elementary flows. When available, local inventories (e.g. the energy mix in Reunion Island) or contextualised inventories from the literature (e.g. Agribalyse for animal feed) were used to provide conversion factors. The EcoInvent database was used as an alternative  [42] . 
 Scenarios Mitigation options were based on ongoing projects. Most data were therefore collected in forecast reports from consultancy agencies. For the Equipment upgrading option, biogas and heat generated, which are intended to be used as a substitute for fuel in the currently oil-fired boiler system of the slaughterhouse, were consequently converted into fuel equivalents based on their respective lowest heating value. However, the equipment required to enable the plant to function would increase total electricity consumption. The solid waste produced by the digester was assumed to be used as fertilizer for sugar cane (the main agricultural land use in Reunion Island). The environmental impacts of the corresponding amount of mineral fertilizer avoided were credited back to the system  [43] . The liquid waste from the digester was treated in the communal wastewater treatment plant. For the solar panels, the amount of electricity produced by the panel was deduced from the total amount of electricity consumed. The environmental amortization of the solar panel was taken into account. For the Farm eco-efficiency option, the feed consumption rate of inefficient broiler farms was reduced to the same level as that of the most efficient farms in the local farm population. The corresponding amount of ammonia gaseous emissions due to manure management was also reduced. The most efficient farms consume more electricity because they use ventilation equipment, so the amount of electricity consumed by inefficient farms was increased to that level. For the reduction of transport option, the new transport distance was evaluated from Beira port (Mozambique) to the main port in Reunion Island and technical operations in Mozambique were assessed using local average data for a large maize production area with high expansion potential  [44] . Direct emissions from maize fields were estimated according to Nemecek and Kägi  [45] . 
 Multicriteria Evaluation of the Baseline and Improvement Scenarios A simplified calculator was developed using Microsoft Office Excel software to facilitate its reuse by the focal firm. The first spreadsheet serves as the user interface. It contains a form allowing optional context variables (e.g. growth rates) and improvement measures (e.g. mitigation options like those cited here) to be configured for scenario analysis. The second spreadsheet is the shared inventory of economic and elementary flows. All the flows are spatially differentiated in the inventory by adding a location criterion. For instance, local transport by truck was allocated to Reunion Island (R in  Figure 2 ) whereas boat transport was allocated to the rest of the world (W in  Figure 2) ; and for local transport by truck, the impacts of fossil energy combustion were allocated to Reunion Island, whereas the impacts of its extraction and transport were allocated to the rest of the world. The Excel workbook is connected to a Microsoft Office Access database which contains conversion and characterization factors extracted from the EcoInvent database and the spreadsheet of embedded rates deduced from the input-output tables used for impact calculation and normalization. This calculator provided the indicators and figures in the Results section. 
 RESULTS 
 Impacts of the Actual AVC 
 Socio-economic Impacts The spatial distribution of the value added created by the poultry AVC showed that 78% of the total value was shared by stakeholders in Reunion Island and 39% of the value added was redistributed within the local community. Thus, job creation mainly occurred in the root territory: Reunion Island (  Figure 3) . A total of 1,900 NMW equivalents was created in 2010 by the AVC activity and 89% of job creation occurred in Reunion Island. Respectively 100%, 72% and 87% of direct, indirect and induced jobs were created in Reunion Island. The remainder were created in the rest of the world, mainly in Europe and South America.    Figure 4  presents the normalized results of the environmental impacts of the AVC activities. The spatial differentiation of impacts showed that, except for soil acidification (SA) and the formation of particulate matter (FPM), most impacts occur outside the territory. These results confirmed that SA and FPM are major concerns for Reunion Island. The main concerns for the rest of the world are freshwater ecotoxicity (FEC) and eutrophication (FE), terrestrial ecotoxicity (TE), marine ecotoxicity (MEC) and eutrophication (ME), human toxicity (HT), and fossil fuel depletion (FD), ranked in order of decreasing importance.    Figure 5  shows the relative contribution of the suppliers to the total impact in the nine selected environmental impact categories. Only the six main contributors are differentiated on the vertical axis. 
 Environmental Impacts The 118 remaining contributors are grouped under ""other suppliers"" (in grey). At the Reunion Island level, only two suppliers (local poultry farmers and the local electricity supplier) contributed more than 96% to each selected impact category (formation of particulate matter FPM and soil acidification SA). In the case of the poultry farmers, ammonia emissions from poultry manure are precursors of the secondary particles which cause acidification when they are re-deposited on the soil and cause respiratory problems when they are inhaled  [46] . Concerning the electricity power plant, direct emissions of primary particles discharged into the atmosphere are responsible for respiratory problems when inhaled. At the level of the rest of the world, four suppliers (of electricity, maize, soybean meal and rice) contributed more than 68% to each selected impact category, except for fossil fuel depletion (FD) to which many suppliers contributed and the three main contributors contributed about 57% of the total impact. Concerning the supply of electricity, most impacts were due to pollutants emitted during the extraction of hard coal: phosphate for freshwater ecotoxicity, manganese for human toxicity and nickel for marine ecotoxicity. In the case of maize, soybean and rice, most impacts were caused by phosphate in the case of freshwater eutrophication, by chemical substances (pesticides) emitted into soil and water in the case of freshwater and marine ecotoxicity and human toxicity.   Figure 6  and  Figure 7  show changes in the impacts of the poultry AVC on the challenges selected in 2010 (scenario ""2010""), in 2020 without improvement measures (scenario ""2020"") and in 2020 with improvement measures (scenario ""2020_IS""). With no improvement measures, environmental impacts would increase by an average of +70%. With no mitigation measures, creation of jobs in the AVCIN would be +26% in Reunion Island and +70% in the rest of the world. In the community, the increase in job creation would be around +38% in Reunion Island and +61% in the rest of the world. If all three improvement measures were implemented together (scenario 2020_IS), environmental impacts would decrease by -4.6% to -16.1% depending on the category (with reference to scenario 2020,  Figure 6  and Appendix C). Conversely, the mitigation measures would cause job losses both in the AVCIN and in the community. The losses would range from -2.2% in the AVCIN in Reunion Island to -16.2% in the AVCIN in the rest of the world. Improvement measures would have no impact on competitors due to the hypothesis on the dynamics of the share between the poultry AVC and its competitors (section 2.5).   
 Changes in the Impacts of the Poultry AVC in the Next Ten Years 
 Impacts of Combined Implementation of Improvement Measures 
 Impacts of Improvement Measures Implemented Separately In  Figure 8 , the indicators listed in  Figure 6  and  Figure 7  are aggregated in the six challenges identified during the strategic analysis and defined at the ""selection of indicators and methods"" step (see section 2.3.).  Figure 8  shows changes in the contribution of the AVC to sustainable development according to these six challenges if mitigation measures were implemented separately, with reference to 2020 (scenario ""2020""). The bigger the area covered by the spider chart, the more the mitigation measure would increase the AVC's contribution to sustainable development. Improvement measures are analyzed here with respect to the importance of the resulting changes. Improving farm eco-efficiency would have the most consequences for the different challenges. It would positively affect ecosystem health both in Reunion Island and outside, human health mainly in Reunion Island and resource conservation mainly outside Reunion Island. This mitigation option would have the highest reduction score of all the environmental impact categories i.e., between -11% and -14.1% for TEC, SA, ME, FEC and FPM (appendix C). However, farm eco-efficiency would also negatively affect the AVCIN and the community, even more so outside Reunion Island. A reduction in the distance inputs are transported would have positive impacts on resource conservation, human health and ecosystem health (in decreasing order of importance) only outside Reunion Island. It would limit the impacts of the AVC on marine ecotoxicity, eutrophication and fossil fuel depletion most (Appendix C). The impacts of the ""reduction of transport"" option on the AVCIN and the community would be very limited. Equipment upgrading would have very limited consequences for ecological challenges except for resource conservation outside Reunion Island. The community would also be affected by the equipment upgrading scenario inside Reunion Island and outside. The effects of the three improvement measures on competitors, i.e. importers, were null (see scenarios hypothesis, section 2.5). 
 DISCUSSION In this section we discuss to what extent the methodological choices made in this study are generic and what lessons can be drawn from this case study for broader use of the proposed framework for other AVCs, particularly in the tropics. 
 What Made the Results Useful for Decision Making? According to the stakeholders involved, three key points rendered the assessment results useful: (i) the spatial differentiation of results, (ii) the multicriteria dimension of the analysis and (iii) the simplification of results through the aggregation of indicators. The spatial differentiation of results underlines the distribution of the calculated impacts between territories (Reunion Island versus the rest of the world in our case study) and potential impact transfers between territories depending on the mitigation option. The results directly inform managers how their firm contributes (or not) to the development of the territory compared to other firms. In the case study reported here, most environmental impacts occurred outside the poultry production territory (on average 82% in all the impact categories, see  Figure 4 ). Depending on the category, from two to five firms were responsible for 75% of the total impact (see  Figure 5 ). These firms were generally grain traders who purchase raw materials (i.e. maize, soybean and rice) on the international market to produce livestock feed. Most environmental impacts of the AVC were due to the production and the transport of raw materials that were exchanged on the world market. Conversely, most socio-economic impacts occurred inside the poultry production territory. For the AVCIN and the community, respectively 99.5% and 86.5% of job creation occurred in Reunion Island (section 3.1.1) as the AVCIN and the community were mainly located in the root territory. Indeed, broiler production (i.e. farms) and, associated services and processing facilities (feed factory, chick breeders, slaughterhouse, meat packaging and marketing, etc.) are all based in Reunion Island  (Figure 2 ). The multi-criteria assessment underlined existing trade-offs between the socio-economic and ecological dimensions associated with the improvement measures. This confirms the difficulty involved in simultaneously improving sustainability in all dimensions  [14] . For instance, several tradeoffs would occur if the mitigation measure 'farm ecoefficiency' were adopted. The implementation of this mitigation option would lead to reduce environmental impacts (Appendix C) mainly because of the decrease in the consumption of feed by farms, the volume of meat produced being the same. The implementation of this mitigation option would negatively affect job creation because of the decrease in the consumption of goods and services in the vicinity of the firms that produce animal feed (Appendix C). The aggregation of the results is the subject of ongoing scientific debate  [47] ,  [48] ,  [14] . In our study case, aggregation in six categories was undertaken to facilitate communication with a non-scientific audience. Aggregated results were more easily understood by managers than row impact categories, especially for the ecological dimension which is characterised by a large panel of impact categories. For instance, the radar chart in  Figure 8  clearly showed that Farm eco-efficiency is the mitigation measure that would change AVC impacts most. Resources conservation and human and ecosystem health would be significantly improved by this measure. The community and the AVCIN would also be significantly, but negatively affected (section 3.2.2). Thévenot provides an explanation of how the outputs of the assessment (the results and the tool) were used by the stakeholders for justifying European subsidies in Brussel, eco-labelling and prioritizing improvement measures in Reunion Island. 
 How Can the Determining Issue of Access to Data be Solved in Other Contexts? This study demonstrates that the assessment of the multi-criteria contribution of an AVC to sustainable development involves a heavy burden of data collection and analysis (section 2.6). Data availability is the main limitation to the broader use of the proposed framework to assess other AVCs around the world. In our study case, the application of the framework was facilitated by certain specificities of the AVC and territory. The narrowness and insularity of the territory, Reunion Island, facilitated the definition of the challenges to be met. Likewise, the identification of salient stakeholders of the AVC was easier since most steps, from feed factoring to sale of the finished product, took place in the same territory. In more globalized AVC, the relationships between producers and suppliers are more anonymous and ephemeral  [49] . This may considerably complicate the identification of salient stakeholders. In the present study, we had access to a regional input-output table which meant we were able to calculate results for specific sites. Input-output tables are available for most countries around the world, but there could be more uncertainties in developing countries. Indeed, international accounting standards are still not applied everywhere, given the difficulty involved in collecting and aggregating the data required to construct such accounts  [50] . Moreover, input-output tables are rarely available at the subnational level (except for European ultra-peripheral territories like Reunion Island) and there may be major inequalities and disparities between neighboring territories in each country. The regional input-output tables have been applied to sub-national geographic units since the 1950s  [51]  but this requires the collection of considerable additional data  [52] , which explains why it is not widely used. The detailed production-expenditure accounts of all the local firms of the AVC were important sources of data for our assessment. The poultry AVC we studied is vertically integrated and well organized thanks to a clear division of tasks and to the support of an inter-professional association  [23] . This pattern and the resulting clear communication between firms considerably facilitated access to these data in this study. Moreover, the accuracy of the accounts made it possible to cross-check the data sources provided by firms (expenditure accounts) with data provided by their suppliers (production accounts) and hence to check the coherence of data and to reduce uncertainty. Informal AVCs based on low-input systems are common in developing countries  [53] . For instance, most fresh milk distribution networks around towns in West Africa are supplied by many small dairy collectors linked to an even larger number of dairy farmers with small herds and very variable farming practices  [54] . Conducting a data inventory on this type of food system is challenging because of the lack of quantitative data. An alternative option would be to conduct wide surveys in collaboration with the many heterogeneous stakeholders. But data uncertainty increases when an assessment is based on data provided by expert judgment  [55] . The participation of stakeholders of the AVC, including farmers in the case of informal AVCs, in the whole assessment process (see section 2.6) may be one way to reduce uncertainty  [56] ,  [15] . 
 Are Other Ways to Conduct the Participatory Process Possible? The framework assumes the active involvement of salient stakeholders in data collection to increase the quality and reliability of the inventory data and the definition of the scenarios. The participation of the main stakeholders of the AVC is also seen as a key way to incorporate their values and interests in the analysis  [56] ,  [15] , and to facilitate appropriation of research results by the stakeholders  [57] ,  [14] , and hence to increase the chances that the AVC will evolve. This study confirmed these points and, in addition, that the appropriation of assessment results by practitioners can rely on the construction of a simplified calculator with and for users (section 2.7), as argued by Guerin-Schneider et al.  [57] . This study also showed that all six steps of the framework can be discussed with stakeholders. Each step enabled a significant exchange of knowledge between scientists and practitioners, i.e. mainly firm managers in our case study. The iterative dimension of the approach ensures that the results of one step can lead back to the previous step and to the redefinition of previous methodological choices. For instance, in this case study, the presentation of assessment results led to redefinition of the selected assessment indicators and of scenarios explored (see double arrows in  Figure 1 ; section 2.1). In this study, the stakeholders involved in the entire assessment process were mainly AVC stakeholders, i.e. members of private firms, because we decided to concentrate on people who make decisions concerning possible changes within the AVC. The procedure for the selection of salient stakeholders at the problem framing stage (section 2.3) offers the opportunity to identify the key stakeholder who has most influence on the functioning and impacts of the AVC. In our case study, the focal firm was a key stakeholder who played a key role in the participatory process. The focal firm's involvement at the very beginning of the assessment, its interest in the study and its motivation were keys to the success of the participatory process. It played a determining role in the large-scale involvement of stakeholders in the assessment process (see section 2.1). For future studies, special attention should be paid to identifying this key stakeholder. It is at the end of the chain when AVC functions on demand like in our case  [23] , but this key decisional entity may be located further up the chain in the case of top-down driven AVCs. Including less obvious decisional entities in the participatory process, like the community (e.g. consumers) and salient competitors (not done in this study), may improve the quality of problem framing (steps 1 and 2) and communication on improvement initiative of the AVC. 
 What Are the General Lessons That Can be Drawn for Future Integration of the Methods? This study explored the possible integration of Environmental LCA and the effect method. Some general lessons can be drawn from this experience for future integration of quantitative calculation methods. These lessons are summarized in the four principles of the framework proposed in this paper. First, the calculation procedure must incorporate the effects which occur along the whole AVC, as defined when the system boundaries are drawn. Second, the calculation procedure must be based on the strength of relationships between stakeholders and between stakeholders and the environment. Third, the calculation procedure must allow impact spatialization to distinguish between impacts within the territory and impacts in the rest of the world. Fourth, it is preferable that the chosen methods are compatible with scenarios analysis to provide a dynamic view of the AVC and its impacts. These four principles were defined with reference to advances in Environmental LCA. For environmental LCA, the term ""life cycle"" refers to the notion that a holistic assessment requires the assessment of raw material production, manufacture, distribution, use and disposal including all intermediary transport steps necessary for or caused by the product's existence along an AVC. These different steps (or processes) generally correspond to different stakeholders. Similarly, the socio-economic evaluation by the effect method consists in calculating the value added generated by a project for all stakeholders of the territory concerned: the investor firm(s) (i.e. the firm(s) where the project is implemented), its (their) employees, other connected firms, public authorities, the state, etc. Consequently, the effect method systematically includes the AVC stakeholders in its analysis and calculations, but, like for the environmental LCA, in a second step, the most salient stakeholders have to be selected. For this purpose, the concepts of system boundaries and cut-off criteria was extended to the socio-economic assessment. In the proposed framework, the salient stakeholders are selected according to the same criteria. The salient stakeholders are those with the strongest interactions with the environment and with other stakeholders for the ecological and socio-economic dimension, respectively  [58] . The cut-off criteria differed for each dimension: economic flows (e.g. value added) and market share for the socio-economic dimension and elementary flows (i.e. matter or energy consumption and pollutant emissions) for the ecological dimension (section 2.3). Additional concepts from social LCA (game theory, systematic competitive model  [30] ) were also considered for incorporation in the analysis of stakeholders who are not directly connected to the AVC by economic flows (e.g. the competitors, section 2.3. and Appendix B). Resulting system boundaries differed between the dimensions evaluated (section 2.3). At first sight, this could be considered as a limit to the integration of methods but, the socio-economic and the ecological subsystems are fundamentally different, justifying two different boundaries. This is consistent with the conclusions of Petit et al.  [17]  and Godard et al.  [59] . Method integration can go further. Despite the fact the two assessment methods focus on different types of interactions (economic flows and elementary flows), this study proved that the same AVC inventory can be shared for the assessment of the two dimensions. Economic flows between AVC firms used to calculate job creation, were transformed into elementary flows occurring along the AVC (section 2.4). This ensures the consistency of the comparison of ecological and socio-economic indicators and their dynamics when scenarios are explored (section 3.2.2). Job creation was the indicator chosen in this study. But more economic indicators like value added (i.e. wealth) distribution  [21] , tax and capital can also be provided by the effect method and may be more relevant in other contexts. The lack of quantitative methods to assess ""pure"" social indicators  [60]  like equity or solidarity limits the number of socioeconomic indicators that can be incorporated in multicriteria assessment. For instance, in this study, nine environmental impact categories, versus one socio-economic impact category were considered (section 2.4). Social LCA is the subject of great expectations with respect to new additional social indicators, but Social LCA is still under development  [61] , and today should be considered as a complementary approach to environmental LCA, involving a different approach to life cycle thinking, which also questions method integration  [62] ,  [63] . The third key principle of the framework is the integration of spatial variability in the assessment by using a territorial approach instead of standard sitegeneric assessment. Spatialization helps distinguish impacts within a territory from impacts in other territories, when considering the transfer of impacts to other territories  [64] . Spatialization can also provide a more complete representation of the complexity of a given geographical area (multifunctionality, a system evolving with stakeholder strategies)  [65] ,  [66] . The existence of regional inputoutput tables, i.e. at the level of the root-territory enabled the spatialization of socio-economic impacts of the AVC and its further development. The territory does not necessarily refer to a region or a country but rather seeks to establish a level that is differentiated from the rest of the world  [24] . As mentioned in section 4.2, it is extremely likely that this type of data is not available in other contexts, which would considerably complicate the spatialization of indicators provided by the effect method. Like for Environmental LCA, method integration implies making an analytical choice between a descriptive assessment (i.e. assessing the contribution of one particular way of fulfilling a certain function) and a change-oriented assessment (i.e. addressing the changes caused by a modification from or to one particular way of fulfilling a certain function)  [67] . The effect method is basically a project appraisal method, it consists of an economic analysis and calculation procedure designed to compare two situations: one with and one without a project. This method is thus compatible with both descriptive and change-oriented assessment. As illustrated in this study, the second approach is preferable because it provides the opportunity to involve stakeholders in a positive and constructive dynamics (section 4.3) but it also requires significantly more data to define change scenarios (section 4.2). 
 CONCLUSION A framework designed to evaluate the contribution of AVCs to sustainable development was applied to the poultry meat AVC in Reunion Island. The salient stakeholders of the AVC were involved in the six-step assessment process including: (i) the identification of the key challenges facing the territory, (ii) the selection of corresponding appropriate assessment methods and indicators, (iii) the definition of the AVC to be studied, i.e. the strategic system, (iv) the definition of the improvement scenarios to be explored, (v) data collection, and (vi) the interpretation of the results of the assessment. Our results showed that the AVC externalizes most of its environmental impacts (due to its strong dependence on imports of raw materials), whereas it internalizes most of its contribution to socio-economic impacts (due to the fact that the poultry production and the main associated services and processing facilities are located in Reunion Island). Analysis of the scenarios provided a dynamic view of the future of the AVC and insights into the potential effectiveness of some mitigation options proposed by the stakeholders. The improvement in farm eco-efficiency was the measure that would change the impacts of the AVC the most. Apart from the participatory approach which was chosen to increase the quality and reliability of the assessment, four principles of the framework can be considered generally applicable to identify good candidate methods to use in combination with environmental LCA. First, the calculation procedure must incorporate effects that occur along the whole AVC, as defined when the system boundaries are drawn. Second, the calculation procedure must be based on the strength of relationships (e.g. economic or elementary flows) among stakeholders, and between stakeholders and the environment of the AVC. Third, the calculation procedure must allow impact spatialization to distinguish impacts within the territory from impacts in the rest of the world. Fourth, it is preferable that the chosen methods are compatible with scenarios analysis, i.e. provide a dynamic view of the AVC and its interactions with its socio-economic and ecological environment. These are the four principles of the framework proposed in this paper. Further studies studying different food chains in a broader context are needed to test the genericity of the framework. The fact that the poultry AVC studied here is vertically integrated and deeply rooted in a single narrow island territory, and that it supplies a European ultra-peripheral territory facilitated data collection. Studying informal AVCs like those most frequently encountered in the tropics, will require adapting data inventory methods. The table below provides the main information used to analyse competition on the poultry meat market in Reunion Island. The market was sized based on declared production by competitors, and was double checked using both top down (evaluation based on the needs of the population) and bottom up approaches (evaluation based on the sales of feed and sales of chicks). There are only two feed production factories and two chick producers on Reunion Island, so we were able to accurately estimate the volumes of meat supplied. The analysis revealed three types of poultry meat suppliers in Reunion Island: importers, local AVCs (n = 4) and small independent producers (n = ~200). These suppliers used five retail channels to sell their products: supermarkets, butcher shops, cafés -hotels -restaurants (CHR), the mass catering sector (hospitals, canteens and other collective establishments) and direct sales. The only salient competitor was importers. Importers compete with the local AVC n°1 because 100% of their imports are broiler products and 100% of their volumes are sold via supermarkets, the main retail channel of the AVC in our case study. The other competitors mainly produce other poultry species (local AVCs n°3 and 4) or sell their products through different retail channels from those used by AVC n°1 (local AVCs n°2 and 4). In the reference situation in 2010, importers supplied 17.9 10 3 tonnes of product in competition with the local AVC n°1 studied.

The performance of the coffee system with respect to different ecosystem services is a function of complex space and time-dependent interactions, which can emerge as trade-offs or synergies  (Cerda et al. 2016) . Sustainable pest and disease management strategies require an understanding of the complexity of agroecosystems  (Avelino et al. 2006; Cerda et al. 2016) . The performance of coffee, e.g. productivity  (Vaast et al. 2006) , quality  (Bosselmann et al. 2009 ), biodiversity  (Teodoro et al. 2010)  or sustainability  (Jha et al. 2011 ) under shaded vs. sun-exposed conditions has been explored in numerous studies. Beneficial shading effects on coffee production through the mitigation of microclimatic extremes have been quantified and are generally well-established  (Barradas and Fanjul 1986; Lin 2007) . It has also been acknowledged that the extent to which shaded systems are advantageous depends on the biophysical context  (Cerda et al. 2017; Rahn et al. 2018) . Since shading effects vary across sites and season, its impacts on coffee pests and diseases are ambiguous  (Avelino et al. 2006 (Avelino et al. , 2011 López-Bravo et al. 2012; Boudrot et al. 2016) . Few studies were conducted across different temporal and spatial scales or focused on the effect of multiple factors and response variables. With the availability of both spatial data and statistical tools to evaluate networks of causal relationships  (Grace 2006; Lefcheck 2016) , recent research addresses the complexity of agroecosystems  (Boreux et al. 2013; Allinne et al. 2016) . Shading modifies the environment for pests and diseases directly or indirectly via changes in microclimate, or by creating habitats for beneficial or competitive organisms  (Avelino et al. 2004; Pumariño et al. 2015) . Likewise, shade modifies the environment for many other components of the system, e.g. coffee physiology and productivity, soil, water, as well as biodiversity, which in turn may also be related amongst themselves and with pests and diseases  (Muschler 2004) . Moreover, these ecological mechanisms of shade are altered by greater spatial factors, such as macroclimatic variations along altitudinal or latitudinal gradients  (Staver et al. 2001; Avelino et al. 2011; Cerda et al. 2017) . The case of Coffee Leaf Rust (CLR, Hemileia vastatrix) illustrates how shade can operate in two antithetic pathways: shade may (i) aggravate the disease due to modifying the microclimate to conditions more favorable for the fungus or (ii) regulate yield, which in turn could negatively affect the pathogen because attack intensities are more acute when fruit load is high  (Avelino et al. 2004 (Avelino et al. , 2006 López-Bravo et al. 2012) . CLR has caused tremendous damage for the Arabica coffee sector of the Americas over the past few years  (Avelino et al. 2015) . The combination of suboptimal management and meteorological factors were responsible for the heavy outbreaks and this is expected to play a role under future climate conditions  (Avelino et al. 2015) . In Africa, CLR is the most devastating disease of Arabica coffee after Coffee Berry Disease (Colletotrichum kahawae)  (Matovu et al. 2013) . In Uganda, the impact of CLR became apparent in the 1940s when areas of land typically producing Arabica, had to be replaced with Robusta coffee  (McCook 2006) . In this study, we explore direct, indirect and interactive effects of the altitude and coffee shading system on microclimatic indicators and CLR. We (i) characterized seasonal variations in microclimate and CLR incidence across different altitudes and shading systems. We then (ii) integrated effects between the environment, shading systems, microclimate and CLR into a conceptual and statistical framework to understand directional relationships. 
 Material and methods 
 Study area The study was conducted in three districts that produce Arabica coffee in the Mt Elgon area of eastern Uganda  (Figure 1 ). The area, dominated by smallholder agriculture, has an altitude of 1000-2200 masl. We sampled three altitude ranges (see S1, Supporting Information), low (1100-1400 masl), mid (1400-1700 masl) and high (1700-2200 masl). The area has a bimodal rainfall with peaks in March/April and October/November and is dry in December-February. Annual rainfall is 1200-1800 mm, with mean temperature from 18 to 23°C, depending on altitude. Smallholders grow coffee with varying shade-tree species and density, with bananas or with no shade. Traditional, CLR susceptible varieties such as SL 14, SL 28 and Nyasaland are grown  (Matovu et al. 2013) . 
 Plot selection and characterization We selected sites based on a survey conducted in 2014  (Rahn et al. 2018) . In summary, along the three altitude ranges we created typologies of shading systems using descriptors of the vegetation structure.  Table 1  shows which shade-related descriptors we used and how we characterized them (see also S1, Supporting Information). Based on those typologies, a total of 49 plots (0.03-0.5 ha) were used for the present study. 
 Data acquisition On each plot, we systematically selected nine coffee bushes on a cross-shaped transect representing the shading system of the whole plot. We avoided exhausted, too old (>30 years) or too young (<five years) bushes and those on plot borders to avoid boundary effects. On each coffee bush, six branches in the lower, mid and higher vegetation storey (two per storey) and facing towards different directions were marked. CLR was assessed on these branches by counting healthy and diseased leaves (identified by chlorotic or yellow spots on the lower leaf surface) in approximately six-week intervals from the beginning (March) until the end (December) of 2015 growing season. We installed the temperature and relative humidity data loggers (iButton® DS1923) on a subset of 27 plots (three replicates for each system by three altitudes). We installed two screened loggers  (Holden et al. 2013)  on each plot at the height of 1.50 m, and set them to record each hour during the 2015/2016 season. 
 Explanatory and response variables Explanatory variables included the altitude range (representing a set of topographical indicators), and coffee shading system. Microclimatic variables served as both, response variables as a function of the altitude range and coffee shading system, as well as explanatory variables for CLR. Microclimatic variables explaining CLR variability were generated and selected in two steps. First, we did a literature review to identify microclimatic variables driving CLR epidemics  (Table 2  and S2 of the supporting information). Identified variables (or a related variable if the measurement was not   (Lemmon 1957 ) at four random positions within the plot. SE = Standard error. Means within rows with different letters indicate significant differences (one-way ANOVA, p < .05). Clustering was based on a total of 144 plots, which were sampled in May 2014. In 2015, 22 additional plots were included and classified retrospectively. CB = Coffee-Banana System, CO = Coffee-Open System, CT = Coffee-Tree System. These plots were used for coffee leaf rust assessments. available) were derived from our microclimate recordings, totalling nine microclimatic variables. Second, to select time periods for each variable, four-week time intervals for each monitoring date were extracted. The final number of potential CLR driving microclimatic variables totalled 63 (9 variables × 7 monitoring dates). The maximum CLR incidence (CLR max ) of the season, i.e. the number of diseased leaves as a proportion of the total number of young leaves (according to  Avelino et al. 1991 , determined by the short internode resulting from the dry season) per bush was the response variable. Explanatory and response variables are summarized in  Table 3 . 
 Data analysis 
 (i) Characterization of seasonal variations of microclimate and CLR We identified microclimatic variables and corresponding 4-week time intervals by plotting them against CLR max . We excluded highly autocorrelated predictors by estimating the correlation coefficients matrix. The CLR max and the selected microclimatic variables were plotted per altitude range and coffee shading system to illustrate seasonal variations. Differences among the altitude and shading system gradients were tested with the method described in the following paragraph. (ii) Formulation of a piecewise structural equation model Based on literature and field observations, we developed an a priori conceptual model of the possible underlying relationships between components of the environment, coffee shading system, microclimate, coffee productivity and coffee pests and diseases (  Figure 2 ).  Table 4  shows which variables were considered and how they were used in the subsequent analysis. We used a piecewise structural equation model (SEM) to infer direct and indirect effects of altitude and coffee shading system on CLR max via microclimatic indicators. An SEM is a statistical framework used to understand causalities within complex natural systems  (Shipley 2000; Grace 2006 ). The hypothetical causal relationships are represented in a graphical model, where each path describes directional relationships between variables. We used piecewise SEM enabling generalized linear models to be fit to different distributions, including those typical for pest and disease data. Individual paths are estimated separately and then combined to a series of equations to estimate direct and indirect effects within the system  (Lefcheck 2016) . The piecewise SEM was constructed based on the conceptual model in  Figure 2  and the results of the selection procedure of potential microclimatic variables. First, each response variable, i.e. the microclimatic variables and CLR, representing the component models or paths, were fitted as linear or generalized linear models in dependence on individual or combined predictors. For each path, the best model was selected by Akaike information criterion (AIC). Then, the individual models were combined to a list of equations and applied to the piecewise SEM function. Non-significant paths (p > .05) were excluded from the overall model. The Shipley's test of d-separation was used to test whether significant paths were missing. The Fisher's C statistic evaluated the overall fit of the model. We used R software (R Core Team, 2016) with RStudio (Version 0.99.903) for data analysis. We used ArcMap  (ESRI, 2014)  to produce the maps. We used the 90-m resolution digital elevation model of the shuttle radar topography mission and the administrative borders from the Data.Ug database (http://maps.data.ug/). Temperature (mean, maximum or minimum)  (Rayner 1961; Nutman et al. 1963; De Jong et al. 1987)  Bimodal relation between temperature and CLR spore germination/appressorium formation (optimum range between 21°C and 25°C). Optimum temperature for lesion formation at 22°C. De  Jong et al. (1987)  reported a broader range (16-28°C) for germination and appressorium formation, the latter being stimulated by low temperatures (1) Mean daily, (2) mean nightly c ,   (Rayner 1961; Bock 1962; Nutman et al. 1963)  Light has a retarding but not inhibiting effect on spore germination. Germination is favored by darkness (e.g. at night), but can also occur during the day in dependence of rainfall and temperature. -Humidity (RH) and rainfall  (Rayner 1961; Bock 1962; Nutman et al. 1963; Kushalappa 1982)  The presence and duration of liquid water is essential for CLR germination and infection. Rainfall plays a role in wetting the undersurface of coffee leaves and in spore dispersal   (Leguizamón 1983 ) and incubation period of four to seven weeks  (Rayner 1961) , the four-week interval was considered as reasonable. c In East Africa, infection processes occur between 10 pm and 8 am  (Rayner 1961) , therefore some variables representing the night time hours were extracted. d Based on an empirical model  (Rowlandson et al. 2015) , leaf wetness duration is equal to the number of hours in which the RH (measured 1.5-2.0 m above the ground) is equal or greater than 90%.

 Results 
 (i) Characterization of seasonal variations of microclimate and CLR Microclimatic variables and time periods related to CLR max are shown in  Table 4 . Results of the selection process are shown in detail in S3a-b of the supporting information.  Figure 3  shows the seasonal patterns of selected microclimatic indicators grouped by altitude range and coffee system. The mean night time temperature (TempN) differed between the three coffee systems in the period between May and September. It was lowest in coffee-tree (CT) at low, in coffee-banana (CB) at mid, and in coffee open canopy (CO) at high altitudes. The diurnal temperature range (DTR) was higher in CO systems in all altitudes, but less pronounced in the low altitude range. The dew point temperature (DP) at low altitude was constantly lower in CO systems over the season. At mid-altitude, the mean DP over the season was lower in CT systems, while differences were marginal at high altitudes. The number of night hours with relative humidity >95% (RH95) in CO systems was lowest at low The maximum disease incidence (mean per plot) of the season (CLR max ).

Figure 4  shows the CLR disease process of the 2015/2016 growing season as a sigmoid-shaped growing curve typical for a polycyclic epidemic. At low and mid altitudes, symptoms appeared approximately two months after the rainy season (June/July), when newly grown leaves were fully developed. An exponential increase in CLR incidence followed across the short dry spell around August/September and the second rain flush in October/November, peaking in the main dry season during December until February. The amount of disease at low and mid altitudes was similarly high, while the incidence was lower at high altitudes, where CLR developed after the second rainy season. The CLR incidence in the different systems did not differ at low altitudes. At mid and high altitudes there was a downward gradient of disease incidence from CB to CO and CT systems. 
 (ii) Formulation of piecewise structural equation model (SEM) The piecewise SEM was fitted to infer the effects of the selected microclimatic variables, the altitude class, and coffee system on the maximum CLR incidence. Each component model corresponding to the five response variables, i.e. the four selected microclimatic variables  (Table 4 ) and CLR max , represented one path. Two DP (May-Nov.), DTR (Sept.-Oct.) of the four response functions for the microclimatic variables were significant paths (p < .05). The list of component models consisted of three equations:   CLR max Alt cat x CS + DP MN + DTR SO , (1) DP MN Alt cat x CS, (2) where CLR max is the maximum disease incidence, Alt_cat the altitude category, CS the coffee shading system, DP_ MN the average dew point temperature of May-Nov and DTR_ SO the average diurnal temperature range of Sept-Oct. CLR max was fitted as a generalized linear model with a negative binomial distribution, with DP_ MN and DTR_ SO as linear models. The piecewise SEM (p > .05, Fisher's C, AIC = 59.01) showed interactive, direct and indirect effects of the altitude classes and coffee systems on CLR max (  Figure 5 ). CLR max was predicted to be lower in CT systems, (β = −3.00156, p < .0001), but was also determined by an interacting effect of altitude and system. Highest CLR max were predicted in CO systems at low altitude, but in CB systems at mid and high altitudes. The average DP (May-Nov.) was higher at low and mid, compared to high altitudes (β = 3.1892, p < .0001, β = 1.4821, p < .0001, respectively) and there was a combined effect of altitudes and systems with lowest values in CO systems at low, and in CT systems at mid altitudes (β = 0.6929, p < .05 and β = −0.6220, p < .05). The DTR was highest in CO systems (β = 3.4354, p < .0001) and lowest at mid altitudes (β = −1.5199, p < .05). The Model showed indirect effects of altitude and coffee systems on CLR max , mediated by the microclimatic variables. DTR was negatively (β = −0.2731, p < .0001) and DP positively (β = 1.5577, p < .001) related to CLR max . 
 Discussion We have shown that the effects of the environment (altitude) and coffee shading system (shading) on CLR variability are either direct, interactive or indirectly mediated by key microclimatic indicators. Our case study on CLR illustrates an approach also applicable to other (patho)-systems to describe interactions in agroecosystems. Literature on microclimatic drivers shows that among others, CLR development is dependent on variables related to the presence of liquid water and temperature  (De Jong et al. 1987; Avelino et al. 2004; López-Bravo et al. 2012 ). The microclimatic indicators we identified as CLR drivers (dew point temperature (DP) and the number of hours with RH > 95% (RH95)), relate to dew formation. We also found temperature related variables, especially the DTR, to be decisive for CLR. A lower mean DTR results in shorter latency periods because the temperature is closer to its optimum for infection processes  (Waller 1982; Avelino et al. 2012; López-Bravo et al. 2012) . Night temperatures also affect CLR epidemics. Since germination is favored by darkness  (Bock 1962; Nutman et al. 1963) , most infections occur at night  (Rayner 1961) . It is well established which main factors drive CLR epidemics. However, few studies have investigated how those  microclimatic drivers themselves vary in space and time and how this in turn would be related to CLR. We showed that microclimatic indicators varied as a function of the season, altitude and the coffee shading system. At higher altitudes, humidity indicators decreased in the systems with highest shade (CT) compared to the lowest shade density and diversity (CB and CO). This contradicts the widely-accepted notion of higher moisture and leaf wetness in shaded versus non-shaded systems  (Barradas and Fanjul 1986; Beer et al. 1998; Morais et al. 2006) . The consistently highest DTR values of CO systems agreed with reports of existing literature  (Barradas and Fanjul 1986; Lin 2007) . However, while differences at low altitudes were negligible, they strongly increased with altitude. The variability of microclimatic variables across altitudinal gradients, shading systems and seasons can be explained by processes of surface energy fluxes  (Shuttleworth 2012) . Dew formation is driven by the interplay between air moisture, temperature variations and cooling of plant surfaces via radiation  (Xiao et al. 2013) . This in turn is influenced by cloudiness, wind speed, soil water content and water vapor pressure and hence by altitude and vegetation cover  (Linacre 1982; Dai et al. 1999) . Diurnal fluctuations are extreme at high altitudes and under sun-exposed conditions. The reduced atmospheric pressure causes higher maximum and lower minimum temperatures due to rapid insolation and reduced radiation  (Linacre 1982; Mani 2013) . Clouds as well as shade tree cover buffer these effects, which on the one hand results in a lower DTR in shaded systems  (Dai et al. 1999 ), but also reduced night-time radiation  (Morais et al. 2006 ) and hence less dew formation. In contrast, reduced minimum or night temperatures in unshaded systems increase the nocturnal soil emissivity and hence, dew formation. Those dynamics are furthermore altered by the seasons. Changes in solar radiation, precipitation and cloudiness imply a seasonality in surface energy fluxes and hence microclimate  (Dai et al. 1999; Xiao et al. 2013) . Our data also show these seasonal effects. DTR was lowest and DP/RH95 was highest during the rainy seasons (Apr./May and Oct./Nov.), when cloud cover was high. Differences in microclimatic conditions driven by the environmental and seasonal context influence CLR dynamics. At mid altitudes, highest CLR incidence was found in CB systems, where DTR was low and DP high  (Avelino et al. 2015) . The same reasoning applies for high altitudes, although disease incidence was low due to low mean temperatures. At low altitudes, differences between systems in both microclimatic variability and CLR incidence were minor. Our results agree with the findings of other studies, where CLR was reduced at high altitudes in highly diversified systems  (Avelino et al. 2006; Cerda et al. 2016) . CLR development was also related to the seasonal changes of microclimate. The microclimate differed between altitude ranges and systems during the rainy seasons. In the first season, this may be less important because leaves that are not fully developed are resistant to infection  (Eskes 1982) . In addition, fruit loads, positively related to CLR severity  (Avelino et al. 2006 ) are low during this time. Leaf susceptibility grows with fruit growth  (Kushalappa and Chaves 1980) , therefore microclimatic conditions during the second rainy season might be decisive. In coffee-growing regions with a pronounced dry season such as in our study area, the residual inoculum is minimized by the shedding of diseased leaves and lack of new infections  (Bock 1962) . However, in areas without a clear dry season, microclimatic conditions might influence the inter-seasonal survival of rust spores and disease built-up in the subsequent season  (Waller 1982) . The mediated effects of the environment and coffee shading system through the local microclimate on CLR are fundamental. They co-occur, however, as shown in our conceptual model  (Figure 2) , with a diversity of other influencing factors. Though not addressed in the present study, they are conceptually incorporated within the piecewiseSEM. The altitude range and the shading system are latent constructs; therefore, their direct and interacting effects must be mediated through further mechanisms and variables one way or the other. Our results validate approaches of other studies that showed how production situations (the ecological, technical, social, economic context of agricultural systems  (Rabbinge and De Wit 1989) ) and crop management are linked to crop health and that they can be considered as proxies for microclimate  (Avelino et al. 2004; Savary et al. 2017 ). This is not only important for pests and diseases in coffee-based, but also other tropical agroecosystems that form heterogeneous mosaics of small thermal microhabitats  (Potter et al. 2013) . The impact of micro-environments on crop health are understudied and their ecological relevance understated  (Stigter 2015) . This is especially relevant in the context of adaptation to climate change.

Developing new technologies for the clonal propagation, improvement and breeding of trees can help solve these problems  2  . This has been achieved in part using biotechnology methodologies, such as in vitro propagation, genetic transformation, and marker-assisted breeding for the gradual genetic improvement of woody plants  3, 4  . For in vitro propagation, shoot proliferation methods using adventitious shoots and axillary buds have been widely applied, though research is still largely focused on using somatic embryogenesis (SE) in woody plants  5  . Today, SE is considered as a very promising tool for the rapid and large-scale propagation of elite varieties in many species  5, 6  , and is particularly important for those that have a long life cycle and are difficult to propagate by conventional methods  7  . However, to date, very few examples of commercial SE applications are available. The industrial application of SE in hardwoods remains limited to a few species, such as the hybrid yellow-poplar, cocoa, and coffee  8  . SE technology is still work-in-progress, mainly due to low biological efficiency and high genotypic effects resulting in high production costs  6,9 .  To guarantee the security of the supply chain in response to market demand for elite materials, it is necessary to maximize SE-derived plant production and quality, i.e. to improve SE protocols. Whatever the plant species, a number of common bottlenecks have been noted throughout the main three steps of the current SE process -  (1)  which amounted to approximately 40% of the whole cell suspension. To benefit from all the available embryogenic material at our disposal, we decided to add a grinding step to reduce and homogenize cell cluster diameter.  Figure 1b  shows the effect of grinding on the particle diameter distribution. Cell cluster diameters maintained their statistical normal distribution, but with a shift of the maximum peak towards the range of 100-150 µm. Viability tests  (Fig. 1c,d)  showed similar staining profiles between ground and intact cell clusters, with a prevailing green light emission indicating that cells had high viability. Some peripheral cells emitted red light, indicating their dead status in both ground and intact clusters, though the red emission intensity was more noticeable in ground cells, due to the effect of the grinding blades. The regeneration capacity of ground material had first to be tested under standard in vitro culture conditions (Erlenmeyer flasks)  (Fig. 2) . After 9 weeks of culturing, an average of 3,039 ± 485 normal torpedo-shaped embryos were obtained per gram of inoculated callus (embryos. g −1 callus) representing a biomass of 0.43 ± 0.12 g (n = 6 flasks/condition/replicate). These values were significantly lower compared to those obtained with intact cell clusters, i.e. 4,611 ± 685 embryos. g −1 callus and a biomass of 0.83 ± 0.18 g (***P < 0.001)  (Fig. 2a,b) . However, it should be noted that better synchronization of embryo development was observed. Embryos generated from ground cell clusters were morphologically more uniform, since very few proliferating clusters remained, limiting spatial competition  (Fig. 2c,d) . Achieving uniform cell cluster distribution after automated pipetting in miniaturized culture containers. In order to obtain uniform distribution of cell clusters at the start of culturing, two parameters were quantified to verify uniformity of distribution: the number of cell clusters in each well, and the total area they occupied. The values of 4 independent replicates (n = 24 wells/replicate) were uniform (P > 0.05) and similarly distributed between plates  (1, 2, 3, 4)  and between rows (A, B, C, D), having an average of 23.0 ± 5.6 clusters/ well and occupying an area of 1.39 ± 0.12 mm 2 /well (  Table 1,    Fig. 3a) . The preliminary results showed medium evaporation in peripheral wells (loss of 40% of total volume after 4 weeks compared to central wells) causing non-reproducible embryo regeneration (data not shown). Parafilm-sealed plates were then placed in a culture chamber with 90% RH, which drastically limited the evaporation rate to less than 2% in all wells, and led to uniformity between tested replicates (P > 0.05). Similar distribution of biomass parameters was obtained between peripheral wells (22.5 ± 5.39 cell clusters/well; area occupied 1.39 ± 0.13 mm 2 ) and central wells (23.9 ± 5.63 clusters/well; area occupied 1.39 ± 0.11 mm 2 ) (  Table 1 ). Successful pilot screening for the effect of active compounds on somatic embryogenesis. After satisfactory implementation of a miniaturized and automated embryo regeneration assay, pilot screening was carried out by testing histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) treatments. Four compounds belonging to the HDACi family -Oxamflatin, SAHA, Scriptaid and Trichostatin A -were tested at 3 different concentrations (0.1, 1 and 10 µM) as potential active compounds affecting C. arabica embryo differentiation. The regenerated embryo numbers of 3 independent replicates (n = 18 wells/HDACi/concentration/replicate) were uniform between plates and followed a statistical normal distribution between culture wells. Only clusters treated with 1 µM TSA showed a significant increase in the number of torpedo-shaped embryos obtained after 9 weeks (18.3 ± 3.9 embryos/well vs 6.0 ± 2.5 for untreated control, ***P < 0.001)  (Fig. 4a,b ) and the appearance of the regenerated torpedo-shaped embryos was comparable between clusters treated or not with TSA  (Fig. 4b) . The area occupied by cell clusters in a well was recorded over a 6-week culture period up to the emergence of globular-shaped embryos  (Fig. 4c,d) . Comparing the resulting curves established with cell clusters treated with 1 µM TSA and untreated clusters showed that cluster growth started after 3 weeks and exponentially increased up to the sixth week of culturing (R² = 0.93), when the first globular-shaped embryos emerged  (Fig. 4d) . From 4 weeks under embryo regeneration conditions, the growth of cell clusters treated with 1 µM TSA was significantly better compared to the untreated control (total area of 35.0 ± 3.9 mm 2 vs 21.9 ± 3.4 mm 2 after 6 weeks, ***P < 0.001), explaining the larger number of regenerated embryos obtained after 9 weeks  (Fig. 4a) . www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ To validate the screening carried out in the automated and miniaturized system, the best treatment obtained with 1 µM TSA, with an exposure time of 24 hours, was re-tested under standard in vitro conditions, i.e. 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks. The TSA treatment enhanced embryo regeneration in the same way compared to the untreated embryogenic clusters (9,325 ± 2,240 embryos. g −1 callus vs 4,673 ± 1,614 embryos. g −1 callus, respectively; P < 0.001;  Fig. 5a ). The beneficial effects of TSA were also visible through the increased overall biomass (1.12 ± 0.26 g vs 0.69 ± 0.15 g, P < 0.001;  Fig. 5b ), and the increased length of the treated torpedo-shaped embryos (896 ± 463 µm vs 760 ± 429 µm, respectively, P < 0.001;  Fig. 5c ). Extended exposure to 1 µM TSA, which was also tested (7, 14 d), did not significantly improve the embryo regeneration yield compared to an exposure time of 24 h, but biomass and torpedo mean size significantly increased with an exposure of 14 d to 1 µM TSA. Treating cell clusters with TSA does not affect plant regeneration. The phenotypic data recorded on 160 young plants ready for greenhouse transfer did not reveal any significant differences between plants regenerated from cell clusters treated, or not, with TSA. An ANOVA did not indicate any treatment effect on either main root or stem lengths (data not shown). All plants displayed orthotropic development, with uniform pigmentation and leaf shape  (Fig. 6a)    Table 1 . Assessing the uniformity and reproducibility of automated distribution of Arabica cell clusters in 24-well plates. Uniformity of distribution was revealed between plates, between rows, and between central and peripheral wells. Three parameters were quantified: the number of clusters per well and the total area they occupied (mm²) at the beginning of the regeneration step, and the number of regenerated embryos per well after 9 weeks. Values represent the mean ± SD of 4 independent replicates (n = 24 wells/replicate). For each parameter, differences between plates and between rows were analysed with a one-way ANOVA test, while a t-test was used to analyse differences between central and peripheral wells. The letter ""a"" shows no significant difference between groups (P > 0.05). www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ two axes accounted for only 18.9% of total inertia. Plotting categorical data according to axes 1 and 2 revealed a strong contribution to global variability for 2 plants scored ""376"" and one scored ""382"" for their colour index (Supplementary Data). As a result, no distinction could be detected between TSA treatments so we decided to . Successful pilot screening of active compounds affecting SE in the automated and miniaturized system. Four compounds belonging to the HDACi family (Oxamflatin, Scriptaid, SAHA and TSA) were tested in 24-well plates at three different concentrations (0.1, 1 and 10 µM), as potential active compounds affecting C. arabica embryo differentiation.

This time, 17 components were detected with a total level of 3.4 inertia (data not shown). The contribution of the first two axes to this inertia reached 19.6%. This time, a graphical analysis revealed 2 main groups of categorical data and a smaller third one including atypical, double stem and unrooted plants  (Fig. 6e ). This group did not include TSA treatment or control conditions, indicating a lack of correlation between variables. Considering the upper left of the graph, plants from untreated tissues and tissues treated for 7 days with TSA correlated with plants bearing 2 to 4 pairs of leaves, 1 to 2 roots and various leaf colour indexes (357, 364, 371). Conversely, on the right of the graph, plants arising from cell clusters treated for 1 and 14 days correlated with well-developed plants: 5 to 7 pairs of leaves, 3 to 4 roots, and a stable colour index (377). Thus, treating cell clusters with 1 µM TSA did not show any significant deleterious effect on regenerated plants. 
 Discussion We proved in this study that a major step of SE processes, i.e. embryo regeneration from embryogenic cell clusters, can be successfully miniaturized and automated allowing easy, quick, cheap and reliable testing of numerous compounds at varied concentrations. Switching from conventional 250-ml flask culture containers filled with 100 ml of culture medium to 24-well plates with 1 ml of available nutritive medium allowed a miniaturization factor of 100. With this strong downscaling, consideration could be given to testing the effectiveness of a much larger number of molecules at different concentrations, while reducing the space required (2.5 cm 2 required per well compared to 55.4 cm 2 required per flask and the possibility of stacking multi-well plates). In addition, automation led to a considerable gain in speed and reduced manpower, where only 1 working full-time employee (FTE) was needed to supervise the pipetting platform. For instance, the pilot screening carried out using HDACi treatments required 36 plates, 864 wells, i.e. 864 independent culture environments. The same experiment in flasks was simply unmanageable, as 1 FTE can only inoculate 100 flasks a day, not to mention the space required, whereas inoculation of several hundred wells can be done within hours. Many authors have also shown the importance of miniaturization and automation in animal or plant cell screening systems  [31] [32] [33]  . For instance, Rodriguez-Furlan et al.  33  also showed that the 24-well microplate format used to screen for compounds modulating A. thaliana seedling growth required a minimum of sample handling and allowed automatic acquisition of quantitative data and rapid monitoring of morphological traits (leaf and root growth). This container format, along with automation, allowed the screening of 10,000 structurally diverse compounds in a limited time period. While animal cell screening systems are mainly derived from drug discovery programmes and cancer research  18, 34  , plant cell screening systems were only recently used to study compound effects on growth and development. To date, in plants, only A. thaliana seedlings have been used in such studies, because of their small size, www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ allowing development in multi-well containers  33, 35  . However, automated screening systems for active compounds have never been used in plant propagation procedures. Our system provided the first evidence in plants that miniaturized containers do not hamper embryogenic cell cluster growth and differentiation, and thus enable screening for the effectiveness of compounds in micropropagation, under real conditions and on economically important crops. Our results showed that even after miniaturizing the embryo regeneration step, mechanisms occurring during conventional-scale SE were preserved, as reliable production of well-shaped embryos was achieved. SE miniaturization did not engender any developmental heterogeneity. However, the type of grinding chosen had significant effects by lowering embryo yields in flasks. Since this biological efficiency was reproducible during this step, we did not consider this difference to be a drawback, because the main objective of this miniaturized system was not large-scale embryo production, or to study molecular mechanisms underlying embryogenesis, but to use it on SE as a tool to screen for active compounds, with a view to speeding up protocol optimization. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ A difference in embryo development timing was also noted between the Erlenmeyer flask and 24-well plate culture systems, which could be explained by obviously different physico-chemical environments. While rotary shaking was set to the same speed for both systems (120 rpm), it showed different effects, mainly with fast spatial movement of the nutritive medium in flasks, compared to slow movement in wells, due to their smaller diameter. Such lower shaking is known to affect medium O 2 /CO 2 uptake 36,37 and probably explained the differences between the 2 culture systems. Pilot screening was carried out as proof-of-concept to show that the miniaturized automated culture system we developed was efficient for testing the effect of putatively active compounds on SE, and was reliable and reproducible. Having uniformity of cell cluster distribution is essential before initiating regeneration, to avoid false positives and negatives when screening for active compounds. The use of an automated scanning microscope enabled a considerable gain in speed and quality in terms of image acquisition and analysis. Proof-of-concept was achieved by proving the stimulation of coffee SE by TSA. A 1 µM TSA supply promoted the proliferation of embryogenic cells and led to a 3-fold increase in embryo yield. When re-tested under standard conditions, treatment with 1 µM TSA confirmed its efficiency, hence validating the whole screening system pipeline. Other authors also showed positive effects of TSA on embryogenic structure formation. Li et al.  38  showed that 0.5 µM TSA promoted totipotency in male gametophytes of B. napus and A. thaliana. Male gametophytes, which are rather recalcitrant in haploid embryo development in cultures, formed embryogenic cell clusters after TSA treatment. In agreement with these authors, we hypothesize that the 0.1 µM TSA treatment used in our study was at suboptimal concentration to have any observable effect on SE expression while a 10 µM TSA treatment was toxic to cell clusters preventing embryogenesis to occur. Li et al.  38  associated the TSA mode of action with hyper-acetylation of histones H3 and H4 to block histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. Wójcikowska et al.  39  recently showed that treatment of A. thaliana explants with TSA induces SE without the exogenous application of auxin and, thus, the TSA mode of action is related to the activation of auxin-responsive transcription factor genes. In conifers, TSA caused the de-repression of LEAFY COTYLEDON genes and stimulated the initiation of SE from cotyledonary embryos in Picea abies  40  and in Pinus Sylvestris 41 , but inhibited embryo germination. For C. arabica, 1 µM TSA did not have any significant deleterious effect on plants regenerated from treated cell clusters, and thus can now be considered as an active compound for optimizing SE protocols. As increasing the time of exposure to 1 µM TSA did not differ in embryo yield, we put forward the hypothesis that the mechanism by which TSA triggers its response, i.e. blocking histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, had already occurred on day 1. This screening system proof-of-concept is a key step towards high-throughput active compound screening platforms. The next step will be to scale-up this technology by screening hundreds of libraries on robotic platforms. Such platforms are widely used in drug discovery programmes  18, 36  . They combine robotics, data processing  www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ and control software, liquid handling devices, and sensitive detectors to quickly conduct thousands of tests 42 , allowing high-throughput screening (HTS) for active compounds able to modulate a particular molecular pathway. Current generations of platforms are so robust and user-friendly 43 that HTS can be used to investigate new areas in biology, such as micropropagation. For coffee SE, achieving the intended change of scale, i.e. HTS of hundreds of libraries to optimize SE protocols, still requires three important upgrades to our screening system: (1) new equipment, e.g. high-throughput pipetting platforms; the platforms described above are coupled with a robotic arm and enable full automation of the screening process; (2) new laboratory strategies, e.g. preparation and maintenance of large amounts of embryogenic tissue; (3) new data acquisition strategies; as embryo development occurs in all 3 dimensions, embryo quantification is still difficult to analyse precisely with an automated 2-dimensional scanning microscope. To that end, early SE-markers would be very helpful. Further high-throughput experiments will require a statistical methodology called ""design of experiments"", which helps experimenters to predict how input variables (e.g. active compounds and nutritive compounds) interact to create output responses (e.g. embryo yield) in a process or system (e.g. regeneration process)  44  . Full factorial and fractional factorial experiments are among the most useful multi-factor experiments for scientific investigations  19, 45  , in contradiction with a one factor-at-a-time approach used until now to optimize culture media in micropropagation, which requires many test runs and fails to consider any possible interaction between factors. Thanks to masses of information obtained from ""-omics"" technologies making it possible to describe, in a global way, the pathways involved in the success of the key SE steps 6 , high-throughput screening can already be piloted in a rational way by selecting libraries able to alter target-molecules playing key roles within these pathways. In many cultivated species, including coffee, sequences of genomes, transcriptomes, proteomes and metabolomes are now available  [46] [47] [48] [49]  . This strategy combining these 2 approaches -""-omics"" technologies and robotic screening of active compounds -is currently being implemented by our teams on both cultivated species, C. arabica and C. canephora, in order to speed up the optimization of SE cloning processes and the dissemination of improved varieties. Our focus was turned to the SE differentiation phase, where research tends to maximize embryo yields, but other key phases of the coffee SE process could also be easily optimized as a result of the ""automated screening of active compound"" method, such as the explant-to-callus phase, or the proliferation phase. These results clearly demonstrate the feasibility, in plants, of automated screening for active compounds in miniaturized SE processes. This proof-of-concept represents a key step towards high-throughput optimization of cell culture media in plant micropropagation. This new method is particularly adapted to SE processes carried out in liquid media and, more widely, to all cell culture-based propagation processes. 
 Material and Methods plant material and experimental design to set up a miniaturized and automated screening platform. Embryogenic cell clusters of C. arabica cv. GPFA116 were initiated from leaf explants obtained from 1-year-old plants obtained by SE and grown in the greenhouse of the Nestlé Plant Science Research Unit (Tours, France). The embryogenic cultures were cultivated following the protocols described previously for C. arabica  50  . Briefly, the embryogenic cultures proliferated in 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing M 'proliferation' liquid nutritive medium, i.e. a medium supplemented with 0.3 mg/l 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) and 1 mg/l BA (6-benzylaminopurine)  (Fig. 7a) . To stimulate differentiation of early somatic embryos, cultures are ""classically"" transferred to 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing DIF 'embryo regeneration' liquid medium lacking the auxin 2,4-D at a rate of 0.1 g of embryogenic cell clusters per 100 ml of medium for 9 weeks. For miniaturization purposes, 24-well plates (ref. 734-2325, VWR International, Radnor -USA) were chosen as containers for optimum early embryo development. One ml of DIF medium was distributed per well. For automation purposes, the Viaflo Assist automated pipetting platform (Integra Bioscience Corp., Hudson -USA) equipped with a 6-channel pipette (Voyager, Integra Bioscience) was used. Disposable and sterile tips (Cat#4445, 1250 µl), as well as reservoirs (Cat#4322, 100 ml), were also purchased from Integra Bioscience. One g of Arabica cell clusters was first ground with a commercial blender (model: HGB2WT from Waring, Durrington -USA) with a sterilized MC-3 bowl (Waring Products, Durrington -USA) in 100 ml of differentiation medium for 30 sec at 18,000 rpm before filtration on a 700 µm diameter filter, in order to have particle diameters fitting the pipetting tips  (Fig. 7b,c) . The cell clusters were then inoculated in 24-well plates at an estimated rate of 1 mg per ml per well  (Fig. 7d) . The 6-channel pipette was programmed in order to have uniform distribution of cell clusters between plates, between rows, and between peripheral and central wells. This programme included a mixing step before pipetting, in order to avoid particle sedimentation. The plates were sealed with Parafilm (M from Bemis, Neenah -USA) and placed in the dark in an incubation shaker (CERTOMAT CT plus, Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Goettingen -Germany) set to 90% RH, 25 °C and 120 rpm for 9 weeks up to the regeneration of torpedo-shaped embryos  (Fig. 7e) . Uniformity of cluster distribution was assessed at the beginning of culturing, and embryo yield after 9 weeks. This experiment was carried out in 4 replicates with n = 24 wells/replicate. At the same time, ground and intact cell clusters were cultured in DIF medium under standard in vitro conditions (n = 6 flasks/condition/replicate). Erlenmeyer flasks were placed on shakers (120 rpm) at 25 °C in the dark for 9 weeks. The effect of grinding on regeneration capacity was evaluated according to the number of torpedo-shaped embryos obtained per gram of inoculated callus. Total fresh weight was also reported. The experiment was carried out in triplicate. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ prepared with 5 ml of DIF medium, 8 μl of FDA at 5 g/l (F7378, Sigma Aldrich) and 50 μl of IP at 2 g/l (P4170, Sigma Aldrich). Cell clusters were incubated with 1 ml of staining solution for 10 minutes in the dark before washing 3 times with PBS pH 7.2. Clusters were then suspended in DIF medium and placed between 2 microscope slides for observation. 
 Viability test on cell clusters before and after grinding. Image acquisition and analysis. Images from 24-well plates were automatically acquired using an inverted microscope equipped with a motorized scanning xy stage (Axio Observer D1, Zeiss, Jena -Germany) and a digital camera (Axiocam 503, Zeiss)  (Fig. 7f) . The software (Zen, Zeiss) was programmed to find the position of each well using auto-focusing (4× objective) and 8 horizontal images by 8 consecutive rows  (8 × 8)  were taken in order to register each entire well. The resulting collection of 64 reconstructed images per well was later processed using ImageJ freeware (NIH, Maryland -USA) for cell cluster counting and measurement of their diameter, or the total area they occupied in a well. For viability tests, images of cell clusters were acquired using the same microscope equipped with dichroic filter cubes for the detection of fluorochromes and connected to a UV light source (HXP 120 v, Zeiss). Images of torpedo-shaped embryos were acquired using a digital camera (Moticam 5+, Motic, Hong-Kong) mounted on a trinocular stereomicroscope (SZH10, Olympus Optical, Hamburg -Germany) and controlled by Motic Images Plus (v.3.0, Motic) software for length measurements. 
 Screening of active compounds affecting SE by carrying out HDACi treatments in plates. A full 4 × 4 factorial design of 18 wells replicated 3 times was used to implement the miniaturized bioassay. Four HDACi, Oxamflatin, SAHA, Scriptaid and Trichostastin A (O3139, SML0061, S7817 and T8552, respectively, from Sigma-Aldrich) were tested. Stock solutions of 10 mM were prepared by dissolving the HDACi powders in DMSO, then immediately sterilized by filtration (0.2 μm, Sartorius AG) and diluted in DIF differentiation medium to obtain final concentrations of 0, 0.1, 1 and 10 μM for each HDACi. Ground and filtered Arabica embryogenic clusters were prepared to inoculate 12 24-well plates at an inoculation density of 1 mg/ml of DIF differentiation medium using the Integra pipetting platform (Integra Bioscience Corp., Hudson -USA). For each HDACi, 3 24-well plates were filled with differentiation medium supplemented with 0 (6 wells of row A), 0.1 (e) Plates were placed in the dark in incubation shakers (90% RH 25 °C and 100 rpm) for 9 weeks up to embryo regeneration. (f) An automated inverted plate-reading microscope coupled with a digital camera and computerassisted image analysis were used to count cell clusters, measure the total area they occupied in a well and monitor embryo development. (wells of row B), 1 (wells of row C) and 10 μM HDACi (wells of row D) respectively (n = 18 wells/HDACi/concentration/replicate). The plates were sealed with Parafilm and placed in an incubation shaker (CERTOMAT CT plus, Sartorius AG) at 90% RH, 120 rpm, 25 °C, in the dark for 24 h. The medium was then gradually replaced with fresh DIF medium by replacing half of the well volume for 6 consecutive times using the pipetting platform (Integra Bioscience Corp.) in order to prevent loss of cell clusters. The plates were placed again in the CERTOMAT for 9 weeks under the same culture conditions. The response to treatment was evaluated according to the number of torpedo-shaped embryos obtained. This experiment was carried out in triplicate. tSA re-testing assay under standard in vitro culture conditions. TSA at an optimum concentration of 1 µM was re-tested under standard conditions. To that end, Arabica embryogenic cell clusters were inoculated in 24 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks at a rate of 0.1 g per 100 ml of DIF differentiation medium. Four exposure times to 1 µM TSA were tested (0, 1, 7 and 14 days), at the end of which the medium was replaced with fresh DIF differentiation medium (n = 6 flasks/exposure time/replicate). Flasks were placed on shakers (120 rpm) at 25 °C in the dark for 9 weeks. The response to treatment was evaluated according to the number of torpedo-shaped embryos obtained per gram of inoculated callus. Total fresh weight and mean length of embryos were also recorded. This experiment was carried out in triplicate. A., Issy-Les-Moulineaux -France) containing growth medium for shoot and root development under the same conditions as for the Petri dishes. After 4 months, and for each TSA treatment, 40 SE-derived plantlets ready for greenhouse transfer from 3 boxes were assessed as follows: main root and stem lengths, number of pairs of leaves (lp, from 2 to 7) and roots (r, 0-4), number of stems (a, 1 or 2), growth type (orthotropic or plagiotropic), leaf pigmentation (uniform or variegated), leaf colour index (using a green colour chart, Pantone Carlstadt USA) and leaf shape (normal or abnormal). 
 Statistical analysis. All analyses were performed in R 51 using the default functions. First, homogeneity between replicates was verified using a Kruskal-Wallis test (P > 0.05), then normality of data distribution and homogeneity of variances were assessed. If these conditions were verified, the ANOVA test was used to calculate any significant differences (at P = 0.05) between the groups (if groups >2), or a t-test was used (if groups = 2). If data did not follow a normal distribution, a Kruskal-Wallis test was used to calculate any significant differences (at P = 0.05) between the groups, with a Dunn test as post hoc (dunn.test package). Based on acclimation data, ANOVA were performed on numerical variables, such as main root and stem lengths, to detect any after-effect of the TSA treatment on plant development. For categorical variables, a multiple component analysis (MCA), performed with Minitab v. 18.1, was used to identify correlations between TSA treatments and phenotypes.

As a result, it is now commonly accepted among international donors and researchers that the challenge of feeding the world requires enhancing the quantity and quality of agricultural commodities  [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . This statement is often related to the urgent need to free smallholders in developing countries from the cycle of subsistence farming  [8] . This relates to a more capital intensive vision of agriculture, which includes (1) providing access to innovative agricultural technologies and productive assets in order to increase yields and generate marketable surpluses;  (2)  strengthening the linkages between farm-level production, processing, and marketing activities in order to improve access to markets; and, (3) developing commercial agriculture. To address this vision, the majority of donors, as well as scholars, stress the need of a New Green Revolution, especially in Africa, linking farmers to global value chains. They also emphasize the role of the private sector and foreign investments in the process of closing the yield gap and revitalizing LSLA (large-scale agricultural land acquisition) phenomenon beyond the accumulation of hectares. The authors underline that accessing authentic data could come from participatory action-research initiatives, with ""researchers being the conduits for local voices rather than replacing them""  [30]  (p. 479). In this paper, we report on the experience of a collaborative research process that was conducted in Senegal to provide dynamic and accurate geospatial information regarding land acquisitions. It aims to assess and comprehend agribusiness dynamics at the national level and provide inputs to improve the relevance of global databases. In Senegal, previous agricultural programs have emphasized the need for the development of intensive agriculture and export-oriented farms in order to ""respond to international demand""  [35] . The economic opening of Senegal's market took place in conjunction with the global rise of agricultural commodity prices, and these rising prices stimulated the interest of financial institutions, agribusiness industries, and sovereign wealth funds. The first two considered it to be an economic opportunity, while the latter saw the investment as a means to secure food supplies for the state they represent. This practice peaked in 2008, with the soaring prices of food products triggering several ""food riots"" around the world  [21, 29] . In Senegal, an opposition movement to large-scale land acquisitions culminated in 2012 with the creation of the CRAFS (Cadre de Réflexion et d'Action sur le Foncier au Sénégal). The framework, which groups different NGOs and civil society organizations, came together around the issue of transferring agricultural land that is used by family farming to private investors. In addition to supporting local farmers against ""land grabbing"" dynamics, the civil society organizations and NGOs advocate for improved transparency and reliability in land tenure information in a national context of Land Reform. Indeed, a campaign for National Reform on Land Tenure was initiated in 2012 and it resulted in the proposition of a National Land Policy that was presented to the Senegalese President in October of 2016. The process has been on hold since then. Land reform has always been a difficult subject for Senegalese policy makers and it has not been addressed since 1964 with the enactment of the National Domain Law that banned customary rights in theory but never in practice. Today, the country has overlapping land regulation systems that vary from legal rights that are aligned with official land policy to socially legitimate, but informal, customary rights. These systems coexist in a context of demographic growth, urban sprawl, and the increased commoditization of land. Our research project stems from local demands and it brings together research and development partners to assemble accessible information on land transactions that could be useful for decision making and land use planning. The following section focuses on the Senegalese context, expanding on the agribusiness issue and the way that it has been treated in recent reviews. We then expose the methods that were used in the project and present preliminary results on agribusiness dynamics at different scales. From these results, we delineate future paths for research on agribusiness dynamics in Senegal and then discuss the role of accurate geospatial information on land acquisitions. 
 Materials and Methods 
 Context of Agri-Business Development in Senegal Agriculture in Senegal (including forestry, livestock, and fisheries) accounts for only 15% of GDP, even though 65% of the working population is involved in farming  [36] . Most Senegalese farms are small family farms, with 70% being under five hectares  [37] . Senegal mainly relies on irregular, rain-fed agriculture, which occupies about 87.1% of agricultural families  [37] . Water availability is thus one of the country's biggest agricultural challenges. Peanuts are the engine of the rural economy and are being cultivated on two-million hectares, which accounts for 40% of all cultivated land. Cotton accounts for about 3% of total exports and it represents the third source of export earnings for Senegal (roughly 28 million USD over the period   [1995] [1996] [1997] [1998] [1999] [2000] . However these cash crops are declining, while horticultural products and grain crops are on the increase. In fact, Senegal does not meet its self-sufficiency goals  [38] . The production of food crops cover barely 30% of Senegal's food needs. In addition, agriculture remains extremely vulnerable to climatic variations and to fluctuations in international markets for exports of agricultural products. Economic, climatic, and sanitary constraints lead to declines in yields and cultivated surfaces, as well as the increasing degradation of soil. In general, local farmers lack the resources for the development of irrigation, and the purchase of fertilizers and pesticides along with mechanical and conditioning equipment. These issues have long been identified. Successive Senegalese governments, as well as international donors, have stressed the urgent need for the modernization of agriculture through intensified practices. Following the recommendations of international donors, and hoping to boost the agricultural sector, the Senegalese government has gradually liberalized its market since the late 1990s. The development of this policy has occurred over the course of several legislations and programs that are designed to open the primary sector to foreign investors: This includes Senegal's involvement in the New Partnership for Africa's development  [16] , the vote of the Agro-sylvo-pastoral Act (LOASP) in 2004, the Accelerated Growth Strategy launched in 2005, and more recently, the Emerging Senegal Plan (2012). These initiatives were all promoted by the FAO, the World Bank, and several other international institutions  [39] [40] [41] . On an international level, this rationale is also supported by the G8 New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition (NASAN), which aims to improve food security through policy reforms in 10 African countries (including Senegal). NASAN brings together more than 200 private companies, along with the governments of the target country, the African Union, and NEPAD/CADDP. NASAN is also associated with the Grow Africa program (since 2011), which was set up by the World Economic Forum, African Union, and NEPAD through the New Vision for Agriculture initiative. This program structures a platform that promotes investments in public-private partnerships to improve productivity, environmental sustainability, and economic growth. In 2014, a report that was led by Oxfam highlighted that these international programs encouraged African governments to induce reforms that create favorable environments (e.g., access to land tenure, natural resources, and inputs) for private investments through liberal reforms and deregulation. However, they also stressed the fact that the direct beneficiaries of these policy changes were private companies that lacked transparency in their projects' implementation. The opening of Senegal's market to foreign investors and the growing interest in developing agricultural land have led to the development of agribusiness industries in Senegal  [42] . The Government has looked to these foreign investments in order to meet primary goals, such as the development of food self-sufficiency, the development of food exports, and income generation for the farmers, as well as the improvement of basic infrastructures in remote, rural, and less productive areas. In the Emerging Senegal Plan, which was drafted in 2013, the agricultural section explicitly targets the synergies between agro-industries and family-farms as the main lever to encourage rural development and the emergence of mid-sized farms. This win-win partnership is expected to improve self-sufficiency in rice, maize, onion, peanut, and other horticulture productions. A large number of farmers' organizations, rural stakeholders, NGOs, and politicians have expressed disapproval of the liberal path that was followed by Senegal in terms of agriculture. They have specifically expressed concern about possible land-grabbing from local farmers that lack proof of ownership, the environmental impact of intensive unregulated agriculture, the threat to food security due to the development of export agriculture rather than subsistence crops, and the unwanted and disturbing social changes in the rural communities that are affected by the development of agri-business industries  [21, [41] [42] [43] [44] . Civil society organizations and agricultural unions have also been worrying regarding the potential negative impacts that agro-industries may have on local communities. Although agro-industries have been developing in Senegal since the 1970s, little information is available on the effects of the various initiatives (area, crops, destination of production, permanent and temporary workforce, etc.) The combination of undisclosed investment contracts and insufficient communication from the government and agri-business companies makes access to information extremely complicated, which, in return, fuels doubts and distrust among NGO's and local farmer organizations  [21, 30, 41, 45, 46] . Since it is often difficult to access accurate figures regarding the expansion of certain agri-industries, several Senegalese NGOs have decided to tackle this issue through the quantification of the dynamics at the national scale. A broad range of information was collected, from press releases to personal contacts within local communities. Two national inventories were released  [42, 47] . Land deals in Senegal were also described in more expansive documents that addressed the phenomenon at the international scale  [33, 34] . However, the methodologies and the results significantly differ and they do not provide geo-information on land acquisitions that are made by agri-business farms across the country. This led us to propose a new inventory method, which is partly based on a reasoned definition of the concept of agri-business, the critical inventory of existing sources, and the analysis and mapping of accessible geo-spatialized sources. 
 Defining Agro-Industrial Farms The main objective is to identify, document, and accurately map the agribusiness farms in Senegal. Several terms have been used to describe the companies that are investing in the Senegalese agricultural sector: ""agribusiness"", ""foreign investors"", ""corporate farming"", or ""agro-industrial firms"". The process of larger-scale land acquisition is often and commonly referred to as land grabbing, which implies negative impacts on local agriculture  [24, 48] . As Oya  [49]  argues, the term and concept of land grabbing are elusive and it is important to define which indicators are being considered and taken into account. Here, we derived indicators from the context of what was at stake at a given moment, and thus responded to a demand for information. First, we considered it appropriate to provide another perspective regarding the size of land acquisitions (first indicator) in order to address the intense controversy over the amount of land ""grabbed"". Secondly, we chose to consider the origin of investors (second indicator), since land acquisition processes were largely perceived as being the responsibility of foreign actors. COPAGEN  [42]  reported that more than 80% of land deals were made by foreign stakeholders. Finally, we integrated an indicator that is related to market relations, because agro-industries are designated by the Senegalese government as direct contributors to food security and sovereignty  [38] . All three indicators are developed below. The size of farms is naturally variable, depending on the specificity of national contexts and many others parameters: there is no definitive size threshold. Agro-industries are generally implanted in high profitability farms, which require larger surfaces than the average area of agricultural land that is commonly cultivated in the host country. This size varies depending on the cost of the land, local production costs, and the value of cultivated products. In 2010, the World Bank provided insights at the global scale by synthesizing data provided by member countries, but it did not define a fixed threshold. Among the countries that contributed to the study, the thresholds vary from 500 to 2000 ha  [21] . The other two organizations that have provided worldwide inventories (the Land Matrix and the NGO Grain) both have a threshold at 200 ha, without any further justification. In Senegal, the inventories have a much lower threshold. For instance, previous inventories focused on 20 ha (IPAR) and 40 ha (COPAGEN) of possessed land. One can explain the gap between the global and local inventories by the difficulty for macro inventories to collect information at a finer scale, and by the choice made to identify the largest land acquisitions in priority. Nevertheless, not all these inventories and studies define or justify a threshold: the limits generally depend on the information that is available. The choice of a threshold has to clearly distinguish between family farms and agribusiness farms. In this research project, the threshold of 20 hectares has been chosen. The rationale for this choice is as follows: first, the average size of farms in Senegal was 3.7 ha in 1960 and 4.3 ha in 1998  [50] , and thus by extrapolation, 4.73 ha in 2015. This trend is confirmed by the 2013 national census, which highlights that 69.8% of the farms range between 1 and 5 ha. Family farms are smaller, with 20.9% cultivating less than 1 ha, while 50.7% own less than 3 ha  [51] . In 1998, 99% of farms cultivated less than 20 ha  [50] , and the number only slightly evolved in the 2013 national census, with 97.4% of farms below 20 ha  [37] . The country of origin of the investors is another indicator. Data sources that are available for Senegal include national and international actors. For instance, they include investors from countries with a low GDP per capita, such as Nigeria, Indonesia, and Vietnam. Although a minority, these stakeholders seem to be important  [41] , despite the fact that the phenomenon of land grabbing is often exclusively attributed to investors from rich countries or countries linked to sovereign wealth funds (e.g., China, Saudi Arabia). Certain sources take into account the investments that are made by politicians, religious leaders, farmers, or local business men, whose investments are similar to foreign investments  [49] . However, these types of investments are numerous, concern small areas, and are even more challenging to document. In this paper, we made the choice to only address foreign land acquisition, since our intent is to provide information on foreign land acquisitions in Senegal's agricultural sector. While we acknowledge that investments that were made by domestic stakeholders should be considered in a global assessment of land acquisition dynamics  [52] , we underline here that it was not our focus in this paper. The destination of agricultural production (export or local market). This information is generally absent from land acquisition assessments. Nevertheless, at the international level, it is usually recognized that the majority of agro-industrial production is exported  [53] . In 2012, a study from the Land Matrix database showed that, on a sample of 393 farms taken from the worldwide database, 91 farms (23%) were related to both international and national markets, whereas 36 farms (9%) exclusively channeled their production towards local markets  [46] . For the purpose of this study, we decided to include both domestic and foreign destinations of agro-industrial production. In summary, we have assembled an inventory meant to identify farms that were owned by foreign investors who own more than 20 ha of agricultural land with production that is either exported or sold on the domestic market. It is important to note that investments fitting this definition will be referred to as ""agro-industrial farms"" throughout this paper. Our inventory also includes all land acquisition projects that are related to this definition, such as those being abandoned, forecasted, or currently in the installation phase. 
 Inventory of Agro-Industrial Farms Information on land transactions, such as investment approvals or contracts, is not publicly accessible from government sources. Therefore, alternatives need to be found in order to efficiently inventory the presence of agro-industries in Senegal. We developed a methodology to identify, document, and accurately map the agribusiness farms in Senegal with a multi-source analysis. Based on the criteria that were previously described to define agro-industries, we focused on three tasks: (1) pooling and verifying the data collected in previous inventories, (2) collecting information from civil society at different scales, and (3) validating the information through the use of satellite imagery and/or fieldwork. All of the available documents and assessment reports on the implementation of agro-industrial farms in Senegal were collected. We pooled, compared, and analyzed data from existing inventories in order to set up a provisional list of the agro-industrial projects, only selecting the projects that fit our definition of agro-industrial farms. Given this provisional list, the second step consisted of confirming the existence of these projects. In order to update the list of agro-industrial farms, we used interviews with representatives from the national farmers union and from Senegalese NGOs that are familiar with the issue of agribusiness dynamics. For each project, the following data were collected: the name of the company, number of parcels, number of hectares in each parcel, number of cultivated hectares, types of crops, date of implementation nationality of investors, and source of information. We then used satellite image visualization through Google Earth to record the presence of agro-industrial farms. When these farms were visible on satellite images, manual digitizing of the their outlines was performed using ALOS satellite images (2.5 m of spatial resolution) that were available on the Senegalese Geoportal (http://www.basegeo.gouv.sn/), Landsat images (30 m of spatial resolution, available on the USGS geoportal, http://www.usgs.gov/), and Google Earth images (30 to 2.5 m of spatial resolution). This digitizing was performed with the following precautions: 1. confirm visible presence of a clear delimitation between the outlines of the plots and the rest of the territory  (Figure 1a) ; and, 2. confirm the absence of continuity between fields with similar characteristics. The objective here is to be certain to distinguish between fields in close proximity that belong to different companies (  Figure 1b ). 3. The verification process included several field visits to farm sites where the available imagery was inadequate. In these cases, surveys of cultivated areas, implementation status, and location were completed with the aid of GPS handheld equipment. Each step that was identified above involved a collaborative process in which we partnered with civil society, NGOs, and farmer unions. Representatives at the national scale and local contacts were engaged first to identify available information on agro-industrial farms from documented and/or informal sources. Secondly, they were trained and actively involved in the use of readily available satellite imagery to locate farms. Finally, they participated in field trips that enabled the verification of visual interpretations. 2. confirm the absence of continuity between fields with similar characteristics.

The data that was generated through this methodology was combined with inventories that were previously assembled by Senegalese NGOs  [42, 47] . This database was then cross checked with the Land Matrix and the GRAIN land grab inventories  [33, 46] , deleting the overlapping agribusiness farms and standardizing the data. The results are presented in the next section. 
 Results 
 Comparing Assessments from Literature Comparing national inventories shows a large discrepancy in the estimations of land acquisitions by agro-industrial farms. Areas possessed by agro-industrial farms, range from 258,700 ha to 678,976 ha  (Figure 2 ). At first, it appears that a dramatic increase in land deals may have occurred between 2011 and 2012. However, these figures may not be reliable, and the large disparities may be primarily related to methodological differences between inventory reports: inventory dates,  Figure 1 .

However, these figures may not be reliable, and the large disparities may be primarily related to methodological differences between inventory reports: inventory dates, knowledge of areas, data collection processes, etc. As a result, these reports differ from each other in terms of the information that they convey. For instance, the status of the land allocation appears to vary between reports. In most cases, the information that is provided for the same farm differs on important details, such as the name of the company, the location, and the area concerned. With the exception of Land Matrix, these draft lists do not come with maps, satellite images, or pictures of the land that makes their localization difficult. Inventories fail to include geo-referenced data. Most of the collected information has not been verified on the ground with field surveys and the collection of GPS points, and no mapping has been done to quantify cultivated areas. More generally, we notice that these reports lack comprehensive definitions of agribusiness and fail to define the required criteria that are needed in order to be categorized (size threshold, type of investments, etc.). Most of the numbers that were found in these reports come from secondary sources, farmer networks, or leaks during negotiations between State representatives, local communities, and the companies. The reports do not include validation processes that would require verifying the data. Some very large projects that are mentioned in the reports do not seem to have successfully materialized. For example, COPAGEN announced a 40,000 ha project by the Dangote company to grow sugar cane, GRAIN highlighted a Chinese investment of 100,000 ha for peanut plantation, and IPAR mentioned 10,000 hectares in the vicinity of Thies. Given the gap between the scale of these investments and the total absence of knowledge and media coverage on them, we can assume that these projects were only speculative and they did not materialize. In 2016, the Land Matrix database compiled 503 328 hectares of land transactions in Senegal  [34] . While the number of hectares reported is important, details in the database show that only 4% of them are actually under cultivation, 52% of them were allocated with no information on the production status, and 44% of them are in land transactions that were reported but never implemented. Moreover, the assessments are only based on the inventory of existing granted contracts without any ground-truthing. They either rely on firsthand land inventories (e.g., the original investment contract between the government and agribusiness companies to which farmland has been assigned) or second hand information (press releases, reports, etc.). Frequently, land concessions that are granted on paper do not accurately reflect conditions on the ground, thus leading to inaccurate assessments and interpretations. Moreover, the investment contract is not necessarily the best source of information. The absence of mechanisms to enforce accountability means that there are no incentives to respect the contracts. We believe that the purpose of an inventory should be to assess the actual surface of developed agro-industrial farms rather than to record the allocated surfaces that are granted in contracts. Finally, the development of agribusiness is a recent phenomenon and the situation is changing rapidly. As a result, existing contracts might be revised upwards or downwards and the intended projects might fail or be implemented without being noticed.

Finally, the development of agribusiness is a recent phenomenon and the situation is changing rapidly. As a result, existing contracts might be revised upwards or downwards and the intended projects might fail or be implemented without being noticed. Apart from the Land Matrix that incorporates regular updates of the database, the reports that we analyzed provide punctual assessments and have not published revised versions with more recent information. Therefore, it is impossible to verify whether certain projects have failed or if analyzing these types of databases has developed new projects. Existing reports should be considered more as a summary of all the projects announced at the time of publication rather than a recent estimation of the actual situation on the ground. 
 Interpreting National Inventories The survey that we undertook compiles information of agro-industrial land transactions from various sources, such as grey literature and project reports, and interviews with local representatives of farmers associations. This work allowed for us to identify 60 agro-industrial farms (fitting the definition provided in Section 2.2) that intended to develop their activities in Senegal.  Table 1  provides details on the different sources involved in the compilation and their respective contribution to the database. It is particularly notable that the participatory inventory identified 42 out of a total of 60 references and that 78% of the references in the participatory inventory were not present in previous inventories. Our inventory was designed to be exhaustive throughout the country and it had no time limit. The compilation of intended land transactions identifies some 750,373 hectares. Within the compilation, we distinguish four types of status: land currently being used (ongoing status, 6% of total); land allocated, but not yet used (installation process, 1.8%); land identified for agro-industrial farms, but not yet formally allocated (forecast status, 3.8%); and, land identified by agro-industrial farms, but never advanced beyond the intention process (abandoned status, 88.5% of the total). This last class represents more than 644,000 hectares, and for almost half of these intended land deals (314,700 hectares, 49% of abandoned projects), we found no information regarding the location of an intended implementation (see  Figure 3) .  Figure 3  shows the location of the other abandoned project. We see that most of the projects that were located in the Peanut basin (departments of Kaolack and Kaffrine), Casamance (departments of Zighinchor, Sedhiou and Kolda), and Eastern Senegal (departments of Tambacounda and Saraya) failed. On the other hand, three hotspots can be identified: the delta of the Senegal river (departments of Saint-Louis, Dagana and Louga), the Ferlo area (Linguere department), and the Niayes area between the cities of Dakar, Thiès, and Mbour (departments of Mbour, Rufisque and Thiès). These three hotspots harbor 92% of ongoing land transactions and 100% of the current and forecasted installations.  Figure 4  displays the types of crops cultivated or intended to be cultivated by agro-industrial farms. We observe that most abandoned projects were dedicated to biofuel crops (i.e., Jatropha and Sunflower). These crops were not located in a particular part of the country, but concerned seven departments, from the delta of the Senegal River (i.e., Dagana), to the South-Western part of Casamance (i.e., Ziguinchor).

Ongoing land transactions are mainly made by French companies, generally in the delta of the Senegal River and the Niayes area, and by a single Saudi Arabian company in the Linguere department, where they extract Arabic gum from the plantations of Acacia trees. We note that most of forecasted land transactions have not yet been allocated to particular agro-industrial farms, mainly in the Delta of the Senegal River. This can be explained by the fact that the local administration has recently identified and delineated available land for agro-industrial farms through the PDIDAS project (still registered in the Unknown category). This information is synthesized in  Figure 7 .

 Discussion The land rush has been followed by numerous attempts to monitor the extent of the phenomenon and denounce its impacts  (refs) . From local case studies to global databases, these inventories are often legitimately criticized for the quality of the data and the relevance of their methods  [49] . In this paper, we have demonstrated that previous inventories failed to grapple with a comprehensive representation of agro-industrial farms dynamics in large-scale land acquisitions in Senegal. This failure has primarily been the result of a lack of shared indicators and methodologies. Until now, only Laos (the Lao People's Democratic Republic) has produced a comprehensive inventory and mapping of its agro-industrial farms. The methodology that was used in Laos is particularly interesting, because it combines strong cooperation with authorities in the collection and analysis of existing administrative data, GPS surveys, satellite imagery analysis, and diachronic monitoring  [54] . The main difference between our two studies is that, in the Laotian case study, the demand for the nationwide assessment originates from the government, whereas we present an initiative that was engaged by the civil society at the local and national levels.

The methodology that was used in Laos is particularly interesting, because it combines strong cooperation with authorities in the collection and analysis of existing administrative data, GPS surveys, satellite imagery analysis, and diachronic monitoring  [54] . The main difference between our two studies is that, in the Laotian case study, the demand for the nationwide assessment originates from the government, whereas we present an initiative that was engaged by the civil society at the local and national levels. Another difference from previous assessments is that, in a context of limited information regarding land investments, we believe that data and knowledge production should be seen as boundary objects that engage stakeholders in a federative project. We also argue that seeking unconditional accuracy is improbable, specifically at the national and subnational scales, and that assessing a phenomenon is valuable in terms of the process and collective action it engenders. As a result, the method that was illustrated in this article was not designed to be generalized, but the process was. Indeed, we advocate for ownership of the process to be lodged in a group of actors that are gathered around a common issue and engaged in defining what needs to be observed and which indicators to measure and how. The quality of the research process, including designing methods, collecting, and analyzing data, was greatly facilitated by this partnership. Indeed, the research team benefited greatly from this collaboration with access to data and knowledge that required extensive experience and contacts at both the local and national scales. Nevertheless, our objective was not simply to improve the research through these partnerships: we also sought to engage in an action-research process that would address the needs of civil society and NGOs, particularly with respect to capacity building. We argue here that, in order to sustain this type of endogenous process, it needs to be reinforced by building capacity among stakeholders. In terms of methods, we believe that tools need to be tailored for a certain purpose and a given context. In this case, the tools that were used can be seen as elementary, but they serve as a means of fostering knowledge and understanding the process among stakeholders. As an answer to the syndrome of false precision, many projects focus time and financial efforts on addressing technical issues and developing cutting edge methodologies. In many research-development projects, the methods are passed onto stakeholders, but adoption rates often remain low due to the fact that these stakeholders were seen as end-users and not part of a process to co-develop the methodology. In our opinion, state-of-the-art identification and characterization processes of land acquisitions using advanced computer science need to be seen as part of the process and then mobilized at an appropriate time. This can upscale principles and methods that should be managed and overseen by the involved actors. Here, our position is not to propose yet another exogenous tool, in the hopes that it will be used, but to accompany a process of capacity building, to promote sustainability of a process that enforces continuity in the indicators being monitored, and to increase empowerment/intake by stakeholders. We advocate literacy in a process that is built around accessible tools, yet allowing for credible, legitimate, and salient results (at manageable scales) that provide important insights to enlighten the debate  [55, 56] . Here, we underline the potential of contributive cartography (associated with geoweb 2.0) that democratizes mapping and allows for laymen to create and share content with a community  [57] . As we mentioned previously, geo-information should not be seen as the end-product, but rather as a boundary object that is generated by a collaborative process. In opposition to more conventional and project-based cumulative assessments, we highlight the pragmatic and iterative nature of the process that allows for updating and refining data as well as methods. Since mapping is ""an intrinsically political act"" [58], the access to--and the control of--geospatial information on land acquisitions inherently increases the negotiation capacity among stakeholders, and enhances transparency in land transactions, while strengthening the accountability of land investors. The approach that is developed and discussed here is action-oriented and fitted to a particular context, but we highlight the importance of the upstream definition of what is to be observed. Weak positioning will attract discredit, although the aim is to display evidence that is supported by pragmatic and robust methods, and use this information to build and share knowledge. In Senegal, addressing the question of the extent of land acquisition is a necessary first step in enriching the debate and mobilize stakeholders. In fact, for a long time, assessing size was a challenge that shrouded questions regarding land acquisition processes and impacts  [59] . In a context of land reform in Senegal, it is thus important for national stakeholders to address these questions in order to participate in a political and ideological debate that will shape future land and agrarian regimes. 
 Conclusions In this paper, we report on the experience of a collaborative research process that was conducted in Senegal to provide dynamic and accurate geospatial information on land acquisitions by foreign agro-industrial farms. Our results are twofold: first, we analyzed past attempts to inventory such investments at the national scale, and second, we highlight the levels of precision that resulted from partnering with stakeholders across scales. Combining participatory mapping and fieldwork was particularly beneficial in providing greater precision in the identification of investments in agro-industrial farms, their location, extent, nature, and status. Those results lead us to advocate for the importance of accurate geospatial information to support evidence-based debates on land and agricultural policies. We also demonstrate the value of a process that builds literacy among stakeholders rather than relying on top-down, generic, and normative approaches. We further argue that technical aspects should be seen as boundary objects, whereby the complexity can increase over time and be iteratively developed in parallel with capacity building among the involved stakeholders. Illustrating land transactions through participatory mapping can prove useful in disclosing questions that were previously obscured by a focus on their nature, number, and size. It represents a step forward that supports the questioning of relationships between land transactions and rural development, food security/sovereignty, and more globally, the development of choices and pathways.

Infection indices have varied from 2.83% in Kisaran (Sumatra) to 3% in Central Java, 17% in Londut (Sumatra) and 11% in Riau Province (Sumatra)  [26, 32] . This species is a major public health concern in the Menoreh Hills region, which includes the Kulon Progo District near the border of Central Java Province and the Special Region of Yogyakarta. It is also reported as a major malaria vector in southern Sumatra (Tenang)  [33] [34] [35] [36] . Interestingly, although present in Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Bali and the larger islands in the Nusa Tenggara (Lesser Sunda Islands) region, An. maculatus has either not been reported as a malaria vector or is an epidemiologically insignificant species in these areas  [37] . We analyzed the diversity and phylogeny of An. maculatus samples collected in different locations and islands in Indonesia. We also analyzed the relationship of the proposed novel species present in Kulon Progo District and reared at NIHRD-IVRCRD with other members of the Maculatus Group to derive its putative origin. 
 Methods 
 Mosquito collections and identification Adult mosquitoes were collected from field settings using standard procedures for human-landing and cattle-landing methods  [38]     Table 1 ). Anopheles maculatus samples were initially identified using morphological criteria  [39] . Mosquitoes were sorted and labeled according to locality and date, and stored in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes under dry conditions over silica gel until further analysis  [13, 39] . Additionally, a laboratory strain of An. maculatus originating from Kulon Progo and under continuous colonization for greater than 30 years at the NIHRD-IVRCRD laboratory in Salatiga, Central Java  [23]  was compared with more recent field samples from Kulon Progo collected in 2015. To maintain the colony established at IVRCRD Salatiga, wild type material was re-introduced into the laboratory colony in 2003. This re-introduced wild type material was collected in the exact same location as the initial population, i.e. the village of Hargotirto, Kokap subdistrict, Kulon Progo district, Province of Yogyakarta. Representative field-collected specimens are deposited in the Systematics and Reference Laboratory, IVRCRD, Salatiga. 
 DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing DNA was extracted from the legs of each mosquito using a DNeasy ® Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with modification based on the manufacturer's protocol. The amplification of ITS2 was performed with primers ITS2a (5′-TGT GAA CTG CAG GAC ACA T-3′) and ITS2b (5′-TAT GCT TAA ATT CAG GGG GT-3′)  [39] . cox1 was amplified using the primers CI-N-2087 (5′-AAT TTC GGT CAG TTA ATA ATA TAG-3′) and TY-J-1460 (5′-TAC AAT TTA TCG CCT AAA CTT CAG CC-3′). PCR reactions were carried out using GoTaq ® Green Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). PCR thermocycling conditions for ITS2 were as follows: 94 °C for 10 min; followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 56 °C for 45 s and elongation at 72 °C for 1 min; followed by a final extention step at 72 °C for 10 min. For amplification of the cox1 gene, the following conditions were used: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min followed by five cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 45 °C for 40 s and 72 °C for 1 min; this was then followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 40 s and 72 °C for 1 min, and by a final extention step at 72 °C for 10 min  [40] . The amplified PCR products were separated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and vizualized by SYBR ® safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). A 100bp DNA ladder was used for calculating the size of the PCR products. Amplification products were purified using Applied Biosystems ExoSAP-IT ™ (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Vilnius, Lithuania). Cycle sequencing was performed using the primers listed above and an Applied Biosystems BigDye ™ Terminator v.3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Life Technologies Cooperation, Austin, TX, USA). To remove unicorporated BigDye ® terminators and salts, cycle sequencing products were purified using a BigDye ® Xterminator Purification Kit (Life technologies, Bedford, MA, USA). Sequence data were obtained using a DNA sequencer (Applied The source of geographical data layers is the Indonesia Geospatial Information Agency who granted the permission and rights to publish this map Biosystems ® 3500 Genetic Analyzer) and analyzed using the Sequencing Analysis 6 program (Applied Biosystems). 
 Sequence analysis Sequences were edited using Sequencing Analysis v.5.2 (Applied Biosystems). Sequences were aligned with MUSCLE using SeaView v.4.7  [41]  and Mega X  [42] . Phylogenetic trees were constructed with the maximum likelihood (ML) method and the Kimura-2 (K80) evolutionary model in Mega X. To assess the ML tree reliability, bootstraps were tested with 1000 replicates. To estimate the evolutionary divergence between sequences, genetic distances were analyzed by pairwise distance (p-distance) methods  [43]  in Mega X. Divergence time was calculated based on previously reported estimates giving 1 million years (Myr) for 2.3% difference  [44, 45] .  
 Results 
 ITS2 diversity and phylogeny of Anopheles maculatus The comparative analysis of the ITS2 sequences of all An. maculatus samples and of available reference sequences from other members of the Maculatus Group and select other Anopheles species present in Indonesia indicates that two populations of An. maculatus are present in Indonesia. Samples of An. maculatus coming from Purbalingga (P1), Cilacap (C1, C2), Belu (NT64, NT101), Sebatik Island (N2, N44) and Ogan Komering Ulu (S9, S33) displayed 100% genetic similarity and were also 100% identical to An. maculatus sequences from the mainland Asian continent  (Fig. 2 , Additional file 1:  Table S1 ). The GenBank An. maculatus sequences used as reference corresponded to mosquitoes isolated in India (JQ446438), Thailand (DQ518615), Vietnam (AY803351), Malaysia (DQ518619), Cambodia (DQ518618) and China (DQ518616). For the nuclear ribosomal ITS2 sequence, the similarity between all An. maculatus reference sequences and sequences from samples P1, C1, C2, NT64, NT101, N2, N44, S9 and S33 indicated a high conservation and genetic homogeneity regardless of distribution and geographical distance  (Fig. 2) . There was also no difference between samples from the continental This phylogenetic analysis indicates that although separated into two different genetic aggregates (groups), collectively the Indonesian samples belong to the Maculatus Group. With respect to genetic distances, the samples displayed two ranges of distances depending on the group considered (Additional file 1:  Table S1 ). The Indonesian An. maculatus group, i.e. samples P1, C1, C2, NT64, NT101, S9, S33, N2 and N44, showed no genetic distance with the continental An. maculatus reference sequences. The ITS2 sequence appears entirely conserved. The genetic distance within the Maculatus Group ranged between 2.7-20.8%, while the genetic distance of the An. maculatus sequences from other group members ranged between 5-16.5% (Additional file 1:  Table S1 ). The Kulon Progo samples (KP10, KP72, 1x, 2M and 4M) displayed no (0%) internal group distance and a 5.5-5.8% distance with the other An. maculatus sequences. Comparison with other members, the Kulon Progo sequences displayed distances of 3%, 6.5%, 7.7-8, 8%, 10.4-10.9%, 15.5-17% and 10.9% with An. dispar, An. greeni, An. dravidicus, An. sawadwongporni, An. willmori, An. pseudowillmori and An. rampae, respectively (Additional file 1:  Table S1 ). The alignment of the Kulon Progo ITS2 sequences with An. maculatus (s.s.) from Indonesia, An. maculatus (s.s.) from mainland Asia, and An. dispar is provided in Additional file 2:  Figure S1 . 
 cox1 diversity and phylogeny of Anopheles maculatus The comparative analysis of the mitochondrial cox1 sequences, indicative of the maternal lineage, showed that all the samples and reference sequences belonged to four genetically distinct and separated lineages, Lineage 1 being separated into two sublineages  (Fig. 3a) . Lineage 4 comprised only Anopheles sinensis (subgenus Anopheles, Hyrcanus Group) and was therefore used as outgroup for the rooted tree  (Fig. 3b) . Lineage 1a comprised Anopheles stephensi, Anopheles flavirostris, An. dispar (a Maculatus Group member), all the Indonesian samples including the Kulon Progo population, An. gambiae and Anopheles barbirostris (Clade I); while Lineage 1b included three out four species of the Leucosphyrus Complex, along with Anopheles macarthuri, a member of the Riparis    Table S2 ). The alignment of the cox1 sequences of the Kulon Progo samples, An. maculatus (s.s.) from Indonesia, An. maculatus (s.s.) from mainland Asia, and An. dispar is provided in Additional file 4:  Figure S2 . 
 Time of divergence The time of divergence was calculated based on previously reported estimates of the variation of the cox1 gene in the genus Anopheles where 2.3% of divergence is estimated to correspond to 1 million years (Myrs)  [42, 43] .  
 Discussion Anopheles maculatus (s.s.) was previously believed to be the only member of the Maculatus Group present in Indonesia, a species regarded as an important vector of malaria in certain localities  [6] . This Asian group is a diverse assemblage with at least nine described species, five of which fall into two subgroups  [3, 10, 12] . Investigating the diversity of An. maculatus in Indonesia was therefore a prerequisite for a better understanding of the distribution, bionomics and variations in vector capacity over its wide geographical range. The investigation reported herein provides several conclusions. First, there is definitive evidence of at least two species within the Maculatus Group in Indonesia, confirming a recent report by Ali et al.  [24] , which raises the number of species to ten (none of which are nominal taxon) within the Maculatus Group. Secondly, An. maculatus (s.s.) appears genetically homogeneous throughout its geographical range in Asia. Thirdly, members of the group in Indonesia differ by maternal origin from all other members, including An. maculatus (s.s.) from mainland Asia, with the lone exception of An. dispar. The Kulon Progo population has been suspected as a distinct species within the Maculatus Group based on unpublished work spanning several decades (MJB, personal comm). This population was recently proposed as a different species based on selected morphological characters and genetic (ITS2 and cox2) sequences  [24] . The ITS2 phylogenetic analysis in the present study confirmed that the Kulon Progo population and all other known An. maculatus sequences analyzed in Indonesia are members of the Maculatus Group, yet they also comprise genetically distinct groups. ITS2 is not considered a good intraspecific marker due to its low evolution rate and high conservation; however, it is a good marker at the species level showing clear discrimination indicative of species separation  [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] . The phylogenetic distance between the ITS2 sequences of the Kulon Progo population and other An. maculatus sample sequences both Indonesia and mainland Asia included in the analysis ranged between 5.5-5.8%. This is greater than the ITS2 distances displayed by other groups of closely related Anopheles species. For example, two sibling species in the Anopheles farauti complex (an assemblage of 8 species) differ by only 4.0%  [51] , while An. greeni and An. dispar (Maculatus Group) also differ by 4.0%  [52] . In Africa, five species within the An. gambiae complex show intraspecific differences ranging between 0.4-1.6%  [53] , while two members of the An. dirus complex, An. dirus (s.s.) (formerly species A) and An. baimaii (species D), display 5.4% genetic distance  [54] . The Kulon Progo population was shown to be morphologically distinct from An. maculatus (s.s.) while cross-mating experiments generated partially sterile hybrids  [24] . The combined evidence confirms that the Kulon Progo population is a distinct species and one that likely extends throughout the greater Menoreh Hill region in central Java. Until a formal morphological description can be made, it is hereby proposed that the Kulon Progo population be designated an infrasubspecific entity, An. maculatus var. menoreh, in reference to its region of origin and to distinguish it from An. maculatus (s.s.). The two Indonesian members of the Maculatus Group and An. dispar belong to the same mitochondrial lineage and differ from that of all other known members of the group outside Indonesia. Collectively, these data demonstrate the occurrence in Indonesia of an introgression of the An. maculatus (s.s.) chromosomal genome from continental to insular populations. A similar phenomenon of introgression has been demonstrated for Anopheles sundaicus complex in Southeast Asia  [44] . Introgression is a key adaptive mechanism of Anopheles mosquitoes to exist in various environments  [44, 55] , and well described in the Anopheles gambiae complex  [56, 57] . The Pleistocene Epoch (2.58 Myrs to 11,700 years ago) is believed to have played a key role in the distribution of Anopheles mosquitoes in Southeast Asia  [46, [58] [59] [60] . The period was characterized by a series of glaciation and inter-glaciation periods, which generated dramatic climatic changes and large variations in sea level  [61, 62] . During glaciation periods, islands west of the Wallace's Line were interconnected on the same land mass known as the Sunda Shelf  [63] [64] [65] ; whereas, during inter-glaciation events the rainforest environments expanded, thus providing more favorable habitats for Anopheles mosquitoes while island landmasses remained isolated. Sulawesi, the eastern Lesser Sunda and Maluku island chains, and western New Guinea Island were isolated and separated by sea from the western half of the Indonesian archipelago, while the Philippines followed a different biogeographical evolution. Palawan Island (western Philippines) was then connected to the Sunda Shelf but later separated and collided with the mobile belt of the Philippine archipelago. This geological history induced by shifts in climate is considered to have greatly influenced the current structural diversity of Anopheles populations in Southeast Asia and the evolution of present-day species complexes through successive genetic expansions and bottlenecks  [66] . Based on the molecular evidence, the Kulon Progo population appears more closely related to An. dispar, a species that appears confined to the northern Philippines. The most parsimonious way to explain this geographical discrepancy is that their common ancestors gradually moved from continental Asia to the current island territories during the Oligocene, which corresponds to the calculated separation of the Kulon Progo lineage from the continental An. maculatus (s.s.) lineage (between 23 and 26.4 Myrs). A movement of An. maculatus from the continent appears to have occurred before 3.4 Myrs ago (between the late Oligocene and early Pliocene epochs), the calculated time of separation between An. dispar and the Kulon Progo population. This event led to introgression of the An. maculatus chromosomal genome into at least a portion of the maternal lineage identified as Lineage 1. During the Pliocene (3.4 Myrs ago), the ancestor of An. dispar was separated from the main introgressed population, likely the result of the tectonic shift of Palawan Island towards the current Philippine archipelago. During the Pleistocene, increased volcanism occurred in central and eastern Java but the Kulon Progo area was naturally spared from the surrounding destruction and served as a relic forest refuge  [67] . This isolation event occurred between 0.22 and 0.65 Myrs, which corresponds to the calculated separation time between the Kulon Progo population and the other Indonesian archipelagic An. maculatus populations. During the late Pleistocene period (200,000 to 11,700 years ago), at least one other species invasion and introgression by continental An. maculatus appears to have occurred which generated the current Indonesian populations of An. maculatus (s.s.). This timescale is in agreement with that calculated for the movements of populations and introgression detected in An. sundaicus in Southeast Asia  [44, 45] . 
 Conclusions Anopheles maculatus, along with Anopheles balabacensis, is the main malaria vector species occuring in the Kulon Progo area and the greater Menoreh region  [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [68] [69] [70] [71] . The evidence presented here confirms that the Kulon Progo population is a distinct species and one that likely extends throughout the greater Menoreh Hill region in central Java. There are now two recognized members of the Maculatus Group present in Indonesia. However, a detailed morphological description of this novel species is required to establish a new nominal taxon. To distinguish it from An. maculatus (s.s.), in the interim it is hereby proposed an infrasubspecific entity ('variety'), An. maculatus var. menoreh.

 The estimated time of divergence of An. maculatus (s.s.) from the Kulon Progo population and from An. dispar was estimated at between 26-26.2 Myrs, and between 30.2-30.9 Myrs, respectively, which corresponds to the Oligocene Epoch. The divergence of the Kulon Progo population from the other members of the Kulon Progo maternal lineage, i.e. An. dispar, An. flavirostris and An. stephensi, is dated 3.4 (Pliocene Epoch), 5.3 (Miocene Epoch) and 5.04 Myrs (Pliocene), respectively. The other Indonesian An. maculatus sequences displayed the same separation time with An. dispar as the Kulon Progo population with the exception of NT101 (Belu, East Nusa Tenggara), C1 (Cilacap, Central Java) and P1 (Purbalingga, Central Java), indicating separation around 3.13 and 3.65 Myrs ago (Pliocene), respectively. The separation of the Kulon Progo population from the other Indonesian An. maculatus samples was dated 0.65 (NT64, S9, S33), 0.43 (NT101, C1, P1) and 0.22 Myrs (C2, N2, N44), all corresponding to the latter part of the Pleistocene Epoch.

Conversely, the samples KP10, KP72, 1x, 2M and 4M isolated from Kulon Progo did not cluster with the continental An. maculatus sequences producing a separate, genetically distinct and homogeneous group more closely related to An. dispar.

 Subgroup, and Anopheles cracens, a member of the Dirus Complex, all five belonging to the Leucosphyrus Group [14] . Lineage 2 comprised only An. balabacensis, the fourth species of the Leucosphyrus Complex. Lineage 3 comprised all of the An. maculatus reference samples and members of the Maculatus Group available in GenBank, excluding An. dispar and the Indonesian An. maculatus samples. Lineage 3 and Lineage 4 branched directly on the root; whereas, Lineage 1a and Lineage 1b were further separated by a bootstrap of 99. The Indonesian An. maculatus sequences within Lineage 1a grouping displayed some internal genetic variability. All Kulon Progo samples examined were identical, while genetic distances of up to 2.6% were observed with An. maculatus (s.s.) from Indonesian (Additional file 3:Table S2). With respect to the other members of Lineage 1a, the closest species was An. dispar with a percentage of divergence ranging between 7.8-8.4% depending on the sample. The divergence of the Indonesian samples with An. flavirostris (Minimus Subgroup) ranged between 12.2-13.5%, while An. stephensi (Neocellia Series) ranged between 10.4-12.2% (Additional file 3:"

 LIMITED FOOD AVAILABILITY Éric Malézieux 1 and Marc Corbeels 2 
 Increase in food demand Although global food production has been increasing dramatically, the world still faces a persistent food security challenge. Currently, many consider that we are producing enough food to meet the dietary needs of today's global population. However, food security is one of the major issues worldwide and is a much more serious problem in LI and LMI countries, where 821 million people still suffered from undernourishment in 2017 . Most people who are not able to afford enough food live in Asia (515 million people were estimated to be undernourished in 2017) and in sub-Saharan Africa (256 million). The proportion of undernourished people remains highest in Africa, where 21 percent of people are suffering from hunger . Looking to the future, population growth and climate change may exacerbate the situation, especially in Africa. Analysis of recent data confirms that the world's population is likely to continue growing for the rest of the century. World population, now standing at 7.7 billion people, would reach 10 billion in 2050 according to the UN's medium variant, compared to 9 billion in the lowest scenario and up to 11 billion in the high variant. It would increase to between 9.6 billion and 12.3 billion in 2100  (Gerland et al., 2014) . This projection hides important differences between continents. The Asian population is likely to peak around the middle of the century and then begin to fall. The main reason for the increase in the projection of the world's population is the growth in the population forecast for Africa, with at least a 3.5-fold increase. In these conditions, how can the world be fed in 2050? First, we have to consider that global food needs will necessarily increase to satisfy the growing population. Looking at different scenarios in the literature, Le  Mouël and Forslund (2017)  suggest the range of expectations for future food needs will be an increase of between 29 and 91 percent over the 2010-2050 period, depending on the assumptions for population growth, economic growth and dietary changes. Hence, global food demand is expected to increase by 60 percent by 2050 compared with  2005 /2007 (FAO, 2017 , with the rise being much greater in sub-Saharan Africa. 
 The challenge of meeting the needs Feeding the world in 2050 will be a challenge as we must consider that we shall face limits and barriers to increasing agricultural supply in order to meet these needs. Indeed, in addition to land degradation and the limits of land availability, scarcity of resources such as water and phosphorus (cf. Chapter 3.1) and climate change will also determine the future conditions and constraints in food production (cf. Section 2). Despite 
 S U M M A R Y While food security is a major worldwide issue, it is a much more serious problem in Low-Income (LI) and Lower Middle-Income (LMI) countries. Currently, sub-Saharan Africa is the sub-continent with the highest proportion of undernourished people, the largest gap between current and potential yields, and between cereal consumption and production. Looking to the future, population growth and climate change may worsen the situation, particularly in Africa. African countries are still facing rapid population growth with uncertain prospects about the ability of their agriculture to meet growing food demand. In addition, without sufficient adaptation measures, climate change will negatively impact food production in most African regions. technological progress, maize, rice, wheat and soybean yields are stagnating or have even fallen in several world regions  (Ray et al., 2012) . The causes are various and complex. In some cases they are linked to socio-economic and institutional constraints, whether these concern input availability in Africa or the intensification of rotations in the USA to increase incomes. It may also be explained by reasons doomed to persist in the long term, such as reaching physical limits in Bangladesh and parts of India and Europe, or the limitation on nitrogen inputs due to environmental concerns in Europe. Without sufficient adaptation measures, climate change will negatively impact food production in many areas  (Lobell et al., 2009 ). In addition, most of the large negative impacts are projected to be in very vulnerable areas that are highly dependent on agriculture in LI and LMI countries. This means climate change is a serious threat to crop productivity in regions that are already food insecure. Furthermore, it is projected that the impacts of climate change on food security are significant, with millions of additional people at risk of hunger by 2050. 
 Food availability in sub-Saharan Africa Despite the importance of sub-Saharan Africa's domestic market  (Bricas, Tchamda and Mouton, 2016) , it is one of the sub-continents with the largest gap between current and potential yields (cf.  Figure  21  and Box 14) and between cereal consumption and production, with current levels of cereal consumption already dependent on substantial imports. As climate change will exacerbate yield variability, with extreme weather events causing production shortfalls, the risks to food security associated with this productivity gap and market instability will continue to grow.  Van Ittersum et al. (2016)  have shown that nearly complete closure of the gap between current yields and yield potential will be needed to maintain the current level of cereal self-sufficiency (approximately 80 percent) by 2050, which is an extreme and improbable objective. As a result, massive cropland expansion with attendant biodiversity losses and greenhouse gas emissions and/or vast import dependency can be expected. Another important reason to increase food production in LI and LMI countries is to improve local economies in areas where numerous poor small farmers and landless workers depend on agriculture and often already suffer from malnutrition. Agriculture-led growth and agriculture-based solutions can make significant contributions to reducing undernutrition. According to the World Bank, agricultural productivity is fundamental for reducing poverty, sustaining the nutritional and health status of billions of people, ensuring food security and generating the resources required to access adequate care, health, water and sanitation services  (World Bank, 2007) . Because many poor and undernourished people are smallholder farmers, it is often assumed that diversifying production would improve dietary diversity within the household. However, interactions between poverty, agricultural production and food security are complex. For example, a paradoxical situation has been identified in the Sikasso region in Mali where substantial agricultural production was concomitant with widespread child malnutrition  (Dury and Bocoum, 2012) . The authors have hypothesised that child malnutrition, reaching the highest level in this region, is linked to less diversified food consumption and probably to a lack of care, as a result of an overload of agricultural labour. Hence, the interactions between health, nutrition and agriculture are mutual: agriculture affects health and health affects agriculture, both positively and negatively. In the absence of conclusive links, both on-farm production and diversity, as well as access to markets, might matter for the diets of smallholder families  (HLPE, 2017) . Indeed, diversification of production at the farm scale can be both a sustainable pathway to increase productivity and incomes, but also a means to improving the food nutrition of poor smallholders. So, in countries with a high prevalence of undernourishment it is very important to ensure the sustainable intensification of agricultural production in order to increase productivity and resilience to climate events that affect access to food. Moreover, increasing the incomes of poor populations, improving rural infrastructure and promoting local systems that ensure access to safe, affordable and varied foods are critically important for improving diets and reducing malnutrition. 
 Towards new solutions By 2050, the world will face the challenge of producing enough food for a projected 9 to 11 billion people, while taking into consideration the impacts of climate change, the growing scarcity of water and land and a change in consumption patterns. Innovative systems are needed everywhere to increase productivity without compromising natural resources . Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to be the most vulnerable region since it has the highest prevalence of undernourished people in the world (FAO 2017), national economies are highly dependent on agriculture (and food imports) and most farmers are poor and have a limited capacity to adapt. There is an urgent obligation to find new pathways to guarantee harmonious agricultural development in rural areas, which is a necessary condition for ensuring food security. With regards to food security, and despite the fact conventional and biotechnological approaches still appear to produce higher yields (but with high impacts on natural resources), new agroecological pathways, including organic agriculture, could be more efficient in meeting this goal  (Schoonbeek et al., 2013; Andriamampianina et al., 2018) . •

 NEW TRENDS AND CHALLENGES 
 BOX 14 yield gaps in sub-saharan africa The yield gap (Yg) is the difference between potential yield (Yp, for irrigated crops) or water-limited yield (Yw, for rainfed crops) and actual yield (Ya), as found in farmers' fields. Yg is based on Yp or Yw that can be simulated with crop growth models using optimal agronomic management as inputs (i.e. cultivar maturity, sowing date and planting density). A global yield gap analysis  has shown that for many crops, especially maize and rice, yield gaps are at their largest in sub-Saharan Africa. For example, actual rainfed maize yields during the period 2003-2012 ranged from 1.2 to 2.2 t/ha, which represents 15 to 27 percent of the water-limited yield potential  (van Ittersum et al., 2016) . For all rainfed crops, the largest gaps are found in the more favourable (higher rainfall) regions of the savannahs and cooler highlands of Ethiopia and the northern Zambia plain (cf.  Figure 21) . Increasing maize yields from the approximately 20 percent of yield potential in 2010 to 50 percent by 2050 would require a doubling of annual crop yield increases compared with past decades. Although it is possible to achieve accelerated yield gains with improved cultivars coupled with good agronomy, increased fertiliser use and modern pest management practices, it is generally agreed that this will require greater investment in research and development in order to tackle the socio-economic constraints (for example, access to capital, infrastructure and markets) that have prevented smallholders in sub-Saharan Africa from achieving higher yields.

In the Afrotropical region, Culicoides species are the main vectors for highly devastating viruses such as Akabane, bluetongue (BT), epizootic haemorrhagic fever and African horse sickness (AHS)  [1, 2] . BT, AHS and EHD are listed among the reportable diseases of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Bluetongue virus (BTV) is transmitted to hosts, both wild and domestic ruminants, by the bites of midges of the genus Culicoides, and infections can lead to the host's death. Few studies exist on the epidemiological situation in Senegal. Two of them estimated sero-prevalence varying between 30 and 59% for cattle and sheep  [3, 4] . Understanding the trophic behaviour and the spatial dynamics of Culicoides species could help in controlling the spread of BT. We then used Boosted Regression Trees and MaxEnt to predict species distribution, and compared their results. These two methods are widely used species distributions models for Culicoides distribution  [46]  and for vectorborne diseases such as Rift Valley Fever (FVR)  [47] [48] [49] [50] , Trypanosomosis  [51, 52] , Chikungunya  [53, 54] , Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV)  [55, 56] , Malaria  [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] , Epizootic Haemorrhagic Disease (EHD)  [62] , Dengue  [63] [64] [65]  and Plague  [66, 67] . 
 Open Access 
 BMC Ecology Our work completes that of Diarra et al.  [23]  investigating the potential effect of bioclimatic variables and livestock densities to predict spatial distribution for four Culicoides species that are potential vectors of BTV (C. imicola, C. oxystoma, C. enderleini and C. miombo), and to identify the most suitable habitats in Senegal. 
 Results In all 1,373,929 specimens of the genus Culicoides belonging to at least 32 different species  [23]  were collected from 96 of the 108 sites visited at the end of the 2012 rainy season (in September and October). C. oxystoma, C. enderleini, C. imicola and C. miombo were the four most abundant species out of the species of veterinary interest  [23] . For the 96 sites visited, C. oxystoma was present in 91 (94.79%), C. enderleini in 92 (95.83%), C. imicola in 92 (95.83%) and C. miombo in 77 (80.21%). The ENFA  (Fig. 1)  showed that the presence of BTV vectors was often positively correlated to some precipitation variables, such as the precipitation of the warmest quarter (Bio18) and precipitation seasonality (Bio15), and to most of the livestock (horses, cattle, donkeys, goats and sheep), either cumulated or taken separately (  Fig. 1a-d) . On the other hand, the altitude (dem) and most of the temperature indices were negatively correlated to species occurrence, notably the maximum temperature of the warmest month (Bio05), mean temperature of the wettest quarter (Bio08) and the annual temperature range (Bio07)  (Fig. 1) . For each species we informed the MaxEnt  (Fig. 2)  and BRT  (Fig. 3 ) models with variables previously found in the ENFA, to predict their geographical distribution. The resulting maps, showed the predicted geographical distributions of these species based on the habitat suitability for each of the four species. The green areas shown are those of greater relative probability of occurrence, while lighter coloured areas are those where the relative probability of occurrence was slight or null. For the MaxEnt model, a high probability of species presence was predicted in the Niayes area and the Groundnut Basin. The Niayes area and northern zone were predicted to be favourable for C. imicola  (Fig. 2a) , C. oxystoma  (Fig. 2b) , C. enderleini  (Fig. 2c ). For C. imicola, C. oxystoma, C. enderleini and C. miombo  (Fig. 2d ) the predicted  Green areas indicate areas that are likely to have suitable habitats for this vector species, while lighter areas indicate areas that are less suitable for the vector presence probabilities were high from the northern Gambia to the eastern Senegal. In the southern Senegal, all species were predicted to be present. The probability of species occurrence was low in the Ferlo area and southeastern area. For each species, the corresponding niche model has an Area Under the Curve (AUC) greater than 0.77  (Table 1) : 0.821 for C. imicola, 0.773 for C. oxystoma, 0.823 for C. enderleini and 0.785 for C. miombo. Comparatively to the MaxEnt model, the BRT model showed a similar predictive area for the ecological niche  (Fig. 3) . However, the probabilities of presence predicted by the BRT model were lower than those predicted by the MaxEnt model. The AUC values of the four species were greater than 0.77  (Table 1)  For the MaxEnt model, altitude was the most important variable driving Culicoides species distribution, all species included  (Fig. 4) . The other most important variables were the mean temperature of the driest quarter, the cumulative livestock density and temperature seasonality for C. imicola  (Fig. 4a) , the cumulated livestock density, annual temperature range, mean diurnal range and mean temperature of the driest quarter for C. oxystoma  (Fig. 4b) , the cattle density, mean temperature of the coldest quarter, precipitation of the coldest quarter and precipitation of the driest quarter for C. enderleini  (Fig. 4c ) and cattle density, mean temperature of the coldest quarter, precipitation of the warmest quarter, precipitation of the wettest quarter and donkey density for C. miombo  (Fig. 4d) . Comparatively, for the BRT model, altitude was the most important variable driving Culicoides species distribution for two species, C. imicola and C. oxystoma and the precipitation of the warmest quarter for C. enderleini and C. miombo  (Fig. 5) . The other most important variables were the mean temperature of the driest quarter, precipitation of the warmest quarter, precipitation seasonality and temperature seasonality for C. imicola  (Fig. 5a) , temperature seasonality, the mean temperature of the driest quarter, mean diurnal temperature range and precipitation of the warmest  quarter for C. oxystoma  (Fig. 5b) , the altitude, mean temperature of the driest quarter, precipitation seasonality and minimum temperature of the coldest month for C. enderleini  (Fig. 5c) , and the altitude, cattle density, minimum temperature of the coldest month and precipitation of the coldest quarter for C. miombo  (Fig. 5d) . Hence, considering these two models, the most common contributing variables for building them were the altitude derived from digital elevation model (dem), the maximum temperature of the warmest month, the precipitation of the warmest quarter, mean temperature of the wettest quarter, temperature seasonality, the precipitation of the wettest quarter and the livestock density. 
 Discussion Predictive modelling of species geographical distributions based on the environmental conditions of known occurrence sites is a major technique in analytical biology, with applications in conservation and reserve planning, ecology, evolution, epidemiology, invasive-species management and other fields  [18] [19] [20] [21] . A nationwide entomological sampling campaign enabled the collection of 1,373,929 specimens of the genus Culicoides belonging to at least 32 different species, at 96 different sites in 12 out of 14 regions of Senegal. For security reasons in southern Senegal, the Ziguinchor and Sédhiou regions were not visited. In this study, ecological niche models were developed for four potential BTV vectors (C. imicola, C. oxystoma, C. enderleini and C. miombo  [23] ) using entomological data, climate, altitude variables and livestock density, to assess the effect of bioclimatic, altitude and livestock density variables on habitats suitable for Culicoides. The ENFA showed that the presence of BTV vectors was positively correlated to precipitation variables and to most of the livestock densities for all species, whilst the altitude (height) https ://en.wikip edia.org/wiki/Digit al_eleva tion_model and most of the temperature indices were negatively correlated to species occurrence. The MaxEnt and BRT models predicted the distribution of Culicoides based on the factors selected by ENFA. The two types of models used the same set of variables, but the importance of each of them varied depending on the species. The models predicted the same suitable zones, but with different probabilities of species presence. Each model had an AUC greater than 0.77. Based on the AUC, the MaxEnt was better than the BRT model for C. imicola, C. enderleini and C. miombo. Temperature and precipitation are well known to be climate parameters that influence density and presence of Culicoides  [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] . In this paper, the maximum temperature of the warmest month, the precipitation of the warmest quarter, the mean temperature of the wettest quarter, temperature seasonality and the precipitation of the wettest quarter were among the most driving factors for Culicoides species. In Senegal, the warmest and wettest months are during the rainy season (July-November), which includes the wettest quarter (August-October) and the warmest one (July-September). In addition, previous studies showed that the peak abundance of most Culicoides species is observed at the end of the rainy season (September-October)  [73] . Furthermore, although each species has its own ecological requirements, any larval habitat could be shared by several ecologically-close species  [17, 70] . This might explain the spatial co-occurrence of Culicoides species as seen in  Fig. 2 . Despite the fact that the presence of watercourses was not included as a predictor in our analysis, our model predicted the presence of Culicoides around Senegalese watercourses and lakes as expected  [70] . Variations in Culicoides density are directly related to rainfall, hygrometry and temperatures, which condition the productivity of larval habitats and the spatial dispersion of adults  [71, [74] [75] [76] . Our observations were consistent with those made by Diarra et al.  [23] . In fact, by using two different statistical approaches, Random Forest (RF) and Generalized Linear models (GLM), Diarra et al.  [23]  showed that rainfall and/or NDVI were the most important variables influencing abundance for the 3 species C. imicola, C. enderleini and C. miombo. According to Diarra et al.  [23] , the abundance of C. oxystoma was mostly determined by the average rainfall and daily average temperature, that of C. enderleini by average precipitation, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, a proxy for vegetation productivity) and the average daily temperature, that of C. imicola was mostly driven by the average precipitation and maximum NDVI, and that of C. miombo by NDVI followed by the average precipitation and average night temperature. As vegetation productivity in the Sahel zone is largely determined by climatic conditions, especially rainfall, we can, like Diarra et al.  [23] , confirm that variations in temperature and precipitation are among the best predictors of Culicoides occurrence and abundance. In contrast to Diarra et al.  [23] , we used new statistical approaches in this study with bioclimatic variables (19) covering a 50-year period, an altitude variable, and six more recent animal density variables. This gave 26 combinations of the four major variables (precipitation, temperature, altitude and livestock). On the other hand, the ENFA showed that the occurrence Culicoides vectors of BTV was negatively correlated with altitude, which was the most important driver according to the MaxEnt and BRT models. It is known that low-lying areas are often characterized by the presence of watercourses, and dense aquatic vegetation with a particular microclimate, so they are very suitable areas for livestock breeding and the development of arbovirus insect vectors  [6, 7, 23, 73, 77] . Studies undertaken in South Korea  [78] , and in Kagoshima, southern Japan  [79]  showed the presence and abundance of Culicoides spp. in areas mainly characterized by a humid subtropical climate. Culicoides presence was also negatively correlated to variables linked to temperature, particularly the maximum temperature of the warmest month and the annual temperature range. Areas with these environmental conditions are predominantly covered by a low vegetation mantle (small bushes and trees). Thus, the Niayes area, where this type of vegetation is predominant, could be a suitable habitat for Culicoides species. Moreover, Diarra et al.  [73] , Fall et al.  [80]  and Diarra et al.  [23]  showed that C. oxystoma is very frequent and abundant in the Niayes area. Livestock density was found to be positively associated with the occurrence and abundance of BTV vectors. Other studies  [7, 81, 82]  pointed in the same direction, showing the very complex relationship between Culicoides and their favourite hosts, ruminants and horses. For all species of interest, the Niayes area and the Groundnut basin were found to be the most suitable habitats, predicted with a high relative probability of occurrence (p > 0.7). In fact, both these areas are lowlying altitude and characterized by dense vegetation and high livestock density. Furthermore, other potential predictor variables could be included in our model: the application of Culicoides control strategies, socio-economic status, human population densities, the presence of Culicoides biological predators, etc. However, our model effectively described habitat suitability using only altitude, temperature, precipitation and livestock density variables. 
 Conclusions We presented ecological niche models for the BTV vectors, C. imicola, C. oxystoma, C. miombo and C. enderleini, on a nationwide scale in Senegal. This modelling approach allowed us to determine the effect of bioclimatic variables and to generate occurrences of Culicoides as risk factors for disease outbreaks. The results from this analysis can be used to (i) improve the quality of BT intervention plans identifying the areas of highest priority for intervention (reducing personnel and equipment costs) and (ii) provide a useful tool for researchers and disease control teams for further studies. Our models represent one of the first essential, albeit laborious, steps towards these future applications. 
 Materials and methods 
 Study area As a part of the nationwide surveillance programme in Senegal in 2012, 108 livestock premises were initially selected (as trapping sites) as follows: 3 departments per region, in 12 of the 14 Senegalese regions and 3 sites per department. The Ziguinchor and Sédhiou regions were excluded for safety reasons. In this study, we only considered data from 96 sites  (Fig. 6)  which were visited at the end of the 2012 rainy season (in September and October). 
 Data collection Entomological data Culicoides specimens were collected on two consecutive nights at each site using Onderstepoort black-light suction traps (Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute South Africa) positioned close to livestock's enclosures. The geographical coordinates of each site were recorded with a Garmin© hand-held global positioning system receiver (accurate to within 10 m) and projected in UTM Zone 28N. Several identification keys were used depending on the species found and their subgenus or group  [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] . For species that were difficult to identify, the specimens were dissected and slide-mounted in accordance with the Wirth and Marston technique for observation under a microscope  [88, 89] . 
 Climatic, environmental and livestock parameters Several variables (26 in total) were used to implement the model. These were grouped in 4 categories (  Table 2) : 11 bio-climatic variables related to temperature (Bio01-Bio11); 8 bio-climatic variables related to precipitation (Bio12-Bio19); elevation data (1 variable) and animal density (6 variables). The bioclimatic data, with a spatial resolution of 30 arcseconds (~ 1 km), were downloaded from the World  Fig. 6  Map of Senegal, a West African country (a), with the location of study sites in 12 Senegalese regions (b). In yellow, the study area and in grey, the unsampled area Climate  [90]  website (http://www.world clim.org/curre nt) and averaged over a 50-year time period between 1950 and 2000 at the same spatial resolution. Elevation data (digital elevation model) were extrapolated from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with a spatial resolution of 30 arc-seconds (~ 1 km). Lastly, livestock data (number of head of cattle, small ruminant, horses and donkeys) were extracted from a survey undertaken at department level by the Direction des Services Vétérinaires (DSV), the Senegalese national institute and relevant body for animal health (DSV, 2013, unpublished work). Before being stacked together, the livestock data (6 variables) were rasterized by department with a spatial resolution of 250 m × 250 m. Livestock data were used due their importance for vector life  [7, 81] . All layers were resampled at a spatial resolution of 250 m × 250 m using the nearest neighbour method and were stacked in one single spatial layer. 
 Modelling habitat suitability We first carried out an exploratory analysis to identify the variables determining habitat suitability (i.e. the presence of the species). To that end, we used an Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA)  [42, 43] , a multivariate approach, similar to PCA, which requires only presence data for the species, in order to explore relationships between occurrence and environmental data. The first axis (marginality axis) of the ENFA is a measurement capturing the dimension in the ecological space conditions where the species is found are far from the global environmental conditions; a large marginality value would imply that the conditions where the species is found are ""far"" from the overall environmental conditions. In contrast, the second axis (specialization) is a measurement of the narrowness of the niche (ratio of the multidimensional variances of available to occupied spaces). During this procedure, highly correlated variables (with a coefficient of correlation higher than 0.95), and those that did not contribute to the ecological niche, were not used in the statistical analyses. After selecting the variables, we used the MaxEnt approach  [19, 91, 92]  to model Culicoides presence. MaxEnt is a machine learning technique based, as the term indicates, on the principle of maximum entropy Isothermality (Bio02/Bio07)*100 Bio03 Temperature seasonality (standard deviation * 100) Bio04 Maximum temperature of warmest month Bio05 Minimum temperature of coldest month Bio06 Annual temperature range (Bio05-Bio06) Bio07 Mean temperature of wettest quarter Bio08 Mean temperature of driest quarter Bio09 Mean temperature of warmest quarter Bio10 Mean temperature of coldest quarter Bio11 Precipitations Annual precipitation Bio12 Precipitation of wettest month Bio13 Precipitation of driest month Bio14 Precipitation seasonality (coefficient of variation) Bio15 Precipitation of wettest quarter Bio16 Precipitation of driest quarter Bio17 Precipitation of warmest quarter Bio18   [93]  is another machine learning technique. The BRT approach developed by Friedman  [94]  uses two algorithms  [30] : regression trees  [95]  and a boosting technique  [96] . Over the past few years, this technique has emerged as one of the most powerful methods for predictive data mining. Some implementations of these powerful algorithms allow them to be used for regression as well as classification problems, with continuous and/or categorical predictors. Basically, the algorithm computes a sequence of simple trees, where each successive tree is built from the prediction residuals of the preceding tree. Entomological data (for each species) were randomly divided into two samples, training and testing, using the K-fold cross-validation method. Accordingly, the original data were divided into k samples, then one of the k samples was selected as the validation set and the other k − 1 samples were the learning set. The performance score was calculated, and the operation was repeated by selecting another validation sample from the k − 1 samples that had yet used for model validation. The operation was repeated k times so that ultimately each sub-sample had been used exactly once as a validation set. The mean of the k mean squared errors was finally calculated to estimate prediction error. In this work we used k = 5. Model performance was tested using the Area under the ROC curve (AUC), a plot of sensitivity against specificity measuring the ability of the model to discriminate between sites where a species was present (y = 1), as opposed to where it is absent (y = 0)  [97] [98] [99] . AUC values range from 0 to 1; an AUC value higher than 0.8 indicates robust performance of the model. Statistical analysis and modelling were performed with R [100] using the following R-packages: adehabitatHS  [101]  for ENFA computation, dismo  [102, 103]  for MaxEnt and GBM  [93]  for BRT modelling.  * Correspondence: ciss.mamadou@gmail.com; biteye88@yahoo.fr 1 Institut Sénégalais de Recherches Agricoles/Laboratoire National de l'Elevage et de Recherches Vétérinaires, BP 2057, Dakar-Hann, Senegal Full list of author information is available at the end of the article

Yield losses can reach 100% when susceptible varieties are sown and infected vectors are present in the field  (Morales & Jennings, 2010) . The causal agent of RHB is a Tenuivirus named Rice hoja blanca virus (RHBV). It is composed of four different filamentous particles that are 3 nm in diameter. Each particle has a different length and contains a different segment of ssRNA. Currently, this disease affects rice fields in Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guyana, Panama, Peru, Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. Disease epidemics are intermittent or cyclical, probably because of the population dynamics of its insect vector, and the interaction between the virus and the vector insects  (Jennings & Pineda, 1971 ;  Morales & Jennings, 2010) . RHBV is closely related to Echinochloa hoja blanca virus (EHBV), which is transmitted by a different Tagosodes species  (Madriz, De Miranda, Cabezas, Oliva, Hernandez & Espinoza, 1998) . RHBV is detectable in both plants and insects through ELISA (enzymelinked immunosorbent assay). Virus incubation requires 20 to 22 days in the insect and 7 to 9 days in 10-day-old plants  (Pantoja, Fisher, Correa, Sanint & Ramírez, 1997) . The virus cannot be transmitted mechanically or through seeds  (Malaguti, Diaz & Angeles, 1956) . The virus also causes disease in the vector insect, shortening its life and decreasing its fecundity  (Jennings & Pineda, 1971) . Symptoms of RHB depend on the variety and age of the plant. Young leaves have short chlorotic stripes, parallel to the midrib. Older plant leaves lose their green color as the chlorotic stripes coalesce into wide white (or pale yellow) bands. These symptoms give the disease its name (hoja blanca means white leaf in Spanish). Eventually, the virus causes necrosis, which begins from the apical part of the leaves and extends toward the base of young plants. Plant tillering decreases, growth is poor, and, sometimes, the disease causes the death of the plant  (Pantoja et al., 1997) . Normally, during late infection, some tillers are also affected, and the panicles are sterile and deformed. Poor root development has also been observed under controlled greenhouse conditions (unpublished data). Unfortunately, once infection occurs, there is no chemical treatment to control or cure the disease  (Pantoja et al., 1997) . Sogata is the common name of the RHBV insect vector, Tagosodes orizicolus (Müir) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae). This species is distributed in almost all of the tropical and subtropical rice-growing areas of the Americas. Sogata sucks nutrients from phloem and excretes honeydew on the leaves, which both encourages fungal growth and reduces the photosynthetic capacity of the plant. In the absence of RHBV, high insect populations cause severe crop damage or hopper burn. Sogata adults are relatively sedentary, but disperse easily with strong winds or water currents  (Heinrichs, 1994) . Sogata transmits RHBV persistently and the virus can be acquired either by feeding on infected plants or transovarially. Interestingly, not all Sogata are capable of virus transmission  (Galvez, Thurston & Jennings, 1961) . However, even when the proportion of Sogata capable of transmission is as low as 1%, serious damage results when susceptible varieties are sown  (Calvert & Reyes, 1999) . Moreover, both chemical and biological control are often ineffective in managing RHBV transmission in Sogata populations. Therefore, RHBV-resistant lines and cultivars are the most effective and economical means of managing hoja blanca disease in rice. Rice hoja blanca disease resistance has proven to be an effective crop management tool. In resistant lines, most plants remain symptomfree, and ELISA fails to detect virus in the plants. ""However, RHBV-resistance in the cultivated rice species O. sativa, especially among cultivars that produce the indica grain type preferred in Latin America, is rare and a major obstacle in the implementation of integrated RHB management programs""  (Morales & Jennings, 2010, p.13) . Thus far, a single cultivar, Fedearroz 2000, is the best source of resistance to RHB disease. Other sources of resistance to RHBV have been identified in O. sativa japonica germplasm and transferred to indica backgrounds suitable for use in Latin American breeding programs  (Zeigler, Pantoja, Duque & Weber, 1994) . The International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) and the Latin American Fund for Irrigated Rice (FLAR) have been evaluating thousands of lines for years. However, no sources have yet provided RHB resistance that is as effective as that of Fedearroz 2000. Thus, only a few sources of resistance have been used to produce all of the commercially available RHB-resistant cultivars. Without the discovery of new efficacious sources of resistance, rice production will be at risk when the virus breaks the resistance of Fedearroz 2000. Here, we report the discovery of new RHBresistance sources in a diverse indica panel of O. sativa. These new resistance sources constitute a resource that can be used to sustainably extend hoja blanca disease management throughout all of the rice-growing regions of tropical America. 
 Material and methods Evaluations were performed with methodologies commonly used at CIAT  (Triana, Cruz & Meneses, 2003) . Indica genotypes were evaluated in four sequential experiments: (1) initial RHBV screening, (2) individual RHBV evaluation, (3) field trials, and (4) insect resistance screening. In each evaluation, Sogata insects were obtained from colonies maintained at CIAT. The RHBVharboring colony contained insects that were fed on RHBV-infected plants and allowed to reproduce on a rice variety (Bluebonnet 50) that is susceptible to both the insect and RHBV. To determine the percentage of virulent insects (insects capable of transmitting the disease) in this colony, 200 individual nymphs were tested for virulence on separate, caged, RHB-susceptible 8-day-old seedlings. The nymphs were permitted to feed and transmit virus to the plants for 3 days. After 11 days, the number of plants displaying disease symptoms was determined and the percentage of virulent nymphs in the colony (62.3%) was extrapolated. This percentage is very high compared to the natural conditions where virulence ranges from 1% up to 5% when the risk of epidemic is severe  (Pantoja et al., 1997) . The RHBV-free colony was begun using nonvector insects, insects that did not transmit disease to susceptible rice seedlings for at least three generations. This colony was maintained separately on RHBV-and insect-susceptible rice (Bluebonnet 50) and closely monitored for any signs of RHB disease symptoms. 
 Initial RHBV screening To identify new sources of resistance against RHBV, 660 genotypes were evaluated in cages, under greenhouse conditions (27 °C, 80% relative humidity, and 12 daylight/12 night hours). We evaluated 295 genotypes belonging to a diverse indica rice panel from the International Rice Research Institute (Group 1) and a second set of lines of diverse origin that were sequenced in ""The 3000 Rice Genomes Project""  (Li et al., 2014)  (Group 2). The genotypes were screened in plastic trays containing sterilized soil arranged in two randomized complete blocks, with three replications and 20 plants per replication. Each block included check varieties Fedearroz 2000 (resistant), Colombia 1 (intermediate), and Bluebonnet 50 (susceptible). Nymphs collected from the RHBV-harboring colony were used to transmit RHBV to the plants. An average of four nymphs per plant were released into each tray 18 days after planting. The nymphs were permitted to feed on the plants for 3 days and were then killed with imidacloprid insecticide. The number of plants showing disease symptoms per genotype was determined visually 40 days after infestation. 
 Individual RHBV evaluation Individual evaluation was performed on genotypes that exhibited a percentage of infected plants lower than that of Fedearroz 2000 in the initial RHBV screening. The main difference in this evaluation was that the insects were not free to choose the plants on which they fed. Instead, four insects from the RHBV-harboring colony were confined together on individual caged plants. The cages were constructed of acetate tubes, covered with tulle fabric to prevent the insects from escaping and to provide aeration. Genotypes and the checks were planted in a completely randomized design with ten replications in one experiment and with 20 replicates in a second experiment. The insects were allowed to feed on the plants for 3 days and were then killed using imidacloprid insecticide. The number of plants displaying RHB symptoms was determined 40 days after infestation. 
 Trials under field conditions The sources of RHBV resistance were evaluated under semi-controlled field conditions based on the CIAT screening  (Zeigler, Rubiano & Pineda, 1988) . This method releases RHBV-vectoring Sogata that are maintained in greenhouse colonies to ensure that RHBV incidence is high. Genotypes that exhibited a low percentage of infection in initial screening experiments were examined in randomized complete blocks with ten replications. Replications consisted of rows 0.5 m in length, with 0.15 m between rows and 100 plants per row. Rows were planted using dry seed. One row was the experimental unit. Fedearroz 2000, Colombia 1, and Bluebonnet 50 were included as checks in each block. Eighteen days after planting, an average of two insects per plant were released. Three days later, the insects were killed with imidacloprid insecticide. The insects came from an RHBV-harboring colony in which 48.6% of the insects were virulent. Forty days later, disease incidence was evaluated using a visual scale of damage with five levels (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9): Level 1, rows exhibiting less than 10% of plants with symptoms; Level 3, >10% and <30%; Level 5, >30% and <50%; Level 7, >50% and <70%; and Level 9, >70%. Levels 1 and 3 were classified as resistant, level 5 was classified as intermediate, and levels 7 and 9 were classified as susceptible. The data were recorded and analyzed as a percentage of incidences in which the rows of each genotype exhibited these reactions.  
 Reaction to insect damage Ideally, commercial varieties targeted for RHBprone areas must be RHBV resistant as well as tolerant of the mechanical damage caused by T. orizicolus. As a consequence, RHB-resistance sources were tested for tolerance of the mechanical damage caused by the insects. The experimental design was completely randomized with three replications and Makalioka (resistant), Cica 8 (intermediate), and Bluebonnet 50 (susceptible) were included as checks. The experimental unit was a set of ten plants that were planted in trays with sterilized soil. Ten nymphs from the virusfree colony were released per plant 15 days after planting. The insects were allowed to feed on the plants until the time of evaluation: the day when 100% of the plants of the susceptible check died (about 8 days after infestation). Evaluation was performed using the Standard Evaluation System for Rice (www.knowledgebank.irri.org/ images/docs/rice-standard-evaluation-system. pdf), in which ratings of 1 and 3 are a resistant reaction, a rating of 5 is an intermediate reaction, and ratings of 7 and 9 are susceptible reactions. The maximum value exhibited observed in a replication was reported as the final result. 
 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis, including linear mixed model and least significant difference (LSD), was carried out to test the differences between the current source of resistance  (Fedearroz 2000)  and each one of the evaluated genotypes. The statistical analysis included a test of the hypothesis to measure the genotype effect through a linear mixed model. Adjusted means were also estimated for each genotype. In addition, a comparison test of adjusted means against Fedearroz 2000 was done through LSD method to identify genotypes better than or equal to Fedearroz 2000. 
 Molecular analysis and genetic variability Population structure for the diverse indica rice panel of 295 genotypes (Group 1) was assessed. The analysis was carried out with the package Structure V2.3 using 83,374 SNPs  (Rebolledo, Peña, Duitama, Cruz, Dingkuhn, Grenier & Tohme, 2016) . Parameters were K=1 to 10 subpopulations, tested with 16 replications, a burning period of 20,000 iterations, and sampling period of 40,000 iterations. The final result of the population structure was obtained using the online tool Structure Plot  (Ramasamy, Ramasamy, Bindroo & Naik, 2014) . Based on population structure analysis, five rice genotypes showing resistance to RHBV and belonging to different subpopulations were chosen for WGS (whole-genome sequencing) at BGI Americas. To determine whether the new resistance sources were different from Fedearroz 2000, single nucleotide polymorphisms were analyzed within and surrounding the QTL associated with RHBV resistance on chromosome 4, previously reported by  Romero, Lozano, Garavito, Carabali, Triana, Villareal… & Lorieux (2014) . The genomic region spanning from 2.81 Mbp to 3.8 Mbp was compared between Fedearroz 2000, the five new sources, and Colombia 1 (intermediate), Fedearroz 50 (highly antibiotic effect against the vector), and Bluebonnet 50 (RHBV-susceptible check). The whole genome sequences (WGS) of the former three genotypes were obtained from previous work  (Duitama, Silva, Sanabria, Cruz, Quintero, Ballen… & Tohme, 2015) ; the WGS of Colombia 1 (IRGC 116970-1-1) and Bluebonnet 50 (IRGC 1799-1-1) were obtained from the 3K RGP  (Li, Wang & Zeigler, 2014) . The reads were analyzed using NGSEP (Next Generation Sequencing Eclipse Plugin) software with the parameters recommended in  Duitama, Quintero, Cruz, Quintero, Hubmann, Foulquié-Moreno,... & Tohme. (2014) . Parameters used for the selection of SNPs were as follows: (1) minimum genotype quality 40, (2) SNPs genotyped in all accessions, and (3) no heterozygous SNPs. All the SNPs located in the selected region were used for the calculation of a p-distance matrix and the construction of an unrooted tree following the neighbor joining (NJ) method with the software SplitsTree4  (Huson & Bryant, 2006) . Based on the SNPs obtained by WGS data, eight polymorphisms within the analyzed region of chromosome 4 were developed as Fluidigm SNPtype assays (Fluidigm®, San Francisco, USA) to build haplotypes and confirm the differences between Fedearroz 2000 and the seven new sources of resistance. 
 Results 
 Initial RHBV screening Through mass evaluation, one genotype belonging to Group 2 was potentially RHBV resistant, and nine from Group 1 were statistically as resistant as the check, Fedearroz 2000 (data not shown). 
 Individual RHBV evaluation After individual confirmation of RHBV reaction, seven genotypes from Group 1 remained resistant under greenhouse conditions  (Table 1 ). The remainder of the genotypes in both groups were susceptible (data not shown).

 Field evaluation Under semi-controlled conditions in the field, four genotypes exhibited a high frequency of resistant rows compared with resistant check Fedearroz 2000: Badkalamkati, IR77384-12-35-3-12-1-B, Pokkali, and PTB 25. The genotypes PTB 9 and WAS 208-B-B-5-1-1-3 exhibited 50% and 20% of susceptible rows, respectively. And, the total number of rows of Sahel 108 was intermediate. None of the genotypes tested was as susceptible as Bluebonnet 50  (Table 2) . Important traits for breeding purposes (Number of tillers, Number of panicles, 1000-grain weight, Number of total grains, Fertility, Plant height, Flowering time, and Cycle length) are shown in  Tables 3 and 4 .

 Reaction to insect damage Six genotypes were as resistant to mechanical damage as Makalioka  (Table 1) . PTB 9 displayed an intermediate reaction, like that of Cica 8. 
 Molecular Analysis and Genetic Variability The structure analysis revealed that the seven new sources of resistance belonged to three different subpopulations  (Figure 1 ). Five genotypes representing the three subpopulations were submitted for WGS (Badkalamkati, IR77384-12-35-3-12-1-B, Pokkali, PTB 9, and WAS 208-B-B-5-1-1-3). A total of 1514 SNPs was identified in the region between 2.81 Mbp and 3.80 Mbp of chromosome 4, which includes the RHBV-resistance QTL region of Fedearroz 2000 and Fedearroz 50  (Romero et al., 2014) . According to the distance-based dendrogram  (Figure 2) , nine accessions analyzed were classified into four groups. Fedearroz 50 and Colombia 1 were close to Fedearroz 2000. On the other hand, the new indica RHBVresistance genotypes were classified into groups II and III, distant from Fedearroz 2000 in group IV. Furthermore, the eight SNPs developed as Fluidigm SNPtype assays allowed us to identify four haplotypes in the region on chromosome 4  (Table 5 ). Fedearroz 2000, Fedearroz 50, and Colombia 1 share the same haplotype, while the seven indica accessions were different.  
 Discussion After Colombia 1, an unacceptable commercial variety, and Fedearroz 2000, the most RHBVresistant variety widely sown in Colombian fields, there has been a limited quantity of sources with high RHBV resistance  (Morales & Jennings, 2010)  and no RHBV-resistant indica type has been identified. In crop management, this constitutes a latent risk, especially since the disease is currently spreading in tropical America. Moreover, past experience demonstrates that monocultures can suffer a breakdown of resistance because of genetic changes in the pathogen. The risk is even greater when plant health relies on a single genetic source of resistance  (Kiyosawa, 1982) . Fedearroz 2000, Fedearroz 50, and Colombia 1 clustered together and were distant from the new indica accessions that show high levels of resistance to RHBV. The analysis of the genomic region surrounding and harboring the QTL suggested that the new sources of resistance are probably unique and different from the one in Fedearroz 2000 and Fedearroz 50. The origin of the resistance in these new sources needs to be clarified. It is still unclear whether it could be an allelic variation of the Fedearroz 2000 QTL or new genomic regions that are involved in resistance responses. Several biparental mapping populations are under development to distinguish between these possibilities. The new RHBV-resistance sources identified in this research are from India, the Philippines, and Senegal, and belong to the indica type. Thus, it is feasible to use these potential sources in crosses targeting the tropics. In addition to RHBV resistance and tolerance of mechanical damage, the new sources are long-grained with intermediate to high amylose content as preferred by most Latin American consumers  (Calingacion, Laborte, Nelson, Resurreccion, Concepcion, Daygon,… & Fitzgerald, 2014) . Those are important advantages for rice breeding programs in the tropical zone. Future investigations will examine the putative antibiotic effects of the resistance to the insects observed in this study, the inheritance of the resistance and antibiotic traits, resistance gene discovery, and the design of molecular markers to accelerate plant breeding with these new resistance sources. 
 Conclusion The resistance sources identified in this research could play a key role in defeating rice hoja blanca disease. This is the first report of rice hoja blanca resistance in indica rice types with different genetic resistance from that of Fedearroz 2000. Some phenotypical traits were determined under CIAT-Palmira field conditions in 2013 and 2014 as part of a complementary study. In 2013, rows were established through transplantation, using five plants per linear meter. In 2014, the rows were established through direct seeding with 20 plants per linear meter. Data are registered in the results section in the interest of rice breeding.

 Introduction Mountains provide ecosystem services that contribute to the wellbeing of people living in them or their foothills (around 20% of the world's population) and many more in the adjacent lowlands  [1] . Mountains occupy 24% of the global land surface  [2]  and host the world's principal biomes supplying a diverse array of ecosystem services  [3, 4] . They play a key role in the water cycle as their grasslands, wetlands and forests contribute to water flow regulation and water quality improvement through water storage and infiltration, as well as the capture of atmospheric vapour (e.g. by mountainous tropical cloud forests)  [5] . As mountains are the source of the world's major rivers, more than half of world's population depends on freshwater regulated and purified by upstream mountain ecosystems  [6] . Mountain ecosystems also regulate natural hazards, such as avalanches, landslides and rock falls, which can be ameliorated by their forests  [7, 8] . Mountain ecosystems produce material benefits that make substantial contributions to lowland and highland economies, such as crops often from subsistence agriculture, animal products from grazing activities, timber, fuelwood, and non-timber products, including game and medicinal plants. In addition, mountains are important providers of nonmaterial benefits because of their scenic beauty and biodiversity  [4, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Mountains are major destinations for touristic or recreation activities and host sites and species of important heritage and cultural values  [14, 15] . Such cultural values are associated with symbolic and spiritual feelings, sense of identity and place, wonder and respect, and the mental wellbeing of local population and visitors  [16] . However, mountain ecosystem services are being affected by various drivers of change, such as rural abandonment, climate and land-use change  [4, [17] [18] [19] [20] . In particular, mountain landscapes offer opportunities to observe early impacts of climate change on ecosystem services  [18] . For instance, rapid glacier retreat and loss of snow cover in the Himalayan Mountains has important consequences on water availability for ecosystems and people within and far beyond mountain boundaries  [21] . Climate change also alters the distribution of plant species and ecosystem functioning, with important implications for the long-term provision of ecosystem services essential for the wellbeing of many people  [22] . Increasing natural hazards, such as rock fall, debris flows and floods, threaten residents and visitors of mountain areas and destroy critical infrastructure  [17] . These climate-induced changes are further superimposed and accelerated by demographic and socio-economic changes, changing the supply and demand of ecosystem services, and ultimately impacting economic activities in mountain areas  [22] . Due to the multiple and complex interlinkages between ecosystem services, biodiversity, human wellbeing and drivers of change  [23, 24] , greater collaboration across the humanities, social sciences and natural sciences is required  [25] . A truly integrated and interdisciplinary research approach is essential for studying the interactions between socio-economic and ecological systems in mountains, including ecosystem services and nature's contributions to people (NCP)  [25] . Among the existing frameworks to analyze complex interactions between socio-economic and ecological systems, the recent conceptual framework of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) offers a clear synthesis of the interlinkages between people and nature  [24] . This framework has been successfully applied in the IPBES Regional Assessments on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services  [26] [27] [28] [29]  and the IPBES Thematic Assessments on pollinators, pollination and food production [30] and on land degradation and restoration  [31] , as well as in research derived from these assessments (e.g.  [32] ) and socio-cultural valuation research (e.g.  [33] ). The conceptual framework of IPBES considers six main components that represent the social and ecological systems as well as their interactions (see  Fig 1) : nature, NCP, good quality of life, anthropogenic assets, direct drivers of change, and indirect drivers of change, with particular emphasis on governance  [24] . Nature refers to the living organisms and their interactions among themselves and with their environment  [24]  and relates to species, ecological communities, functional diversity and biodiversity as a general concept. Nature contributes to the good quality of people's life by providing beneficial NCP, including material, regulating and non-material contributions  [24, 34] . Good quality of life refers to the accomplishment of a fulfilled life by humans  [24]  and encompasses access to basic materials, health, good social relationships, security and freedom of choice  [23, 24] . Direct drivers of change are endogenous pressures of the system that alter the state of nature and people's quality of life  [35] . Anthropogenic direct drivers of change include land-use changes, climate change, pollution, species introductions and overexploitation of ), good quality of life, direct drivers of change, and indirect drivers of change, with particular emphasis on governance. The interactions between these components analyzed in this study are presented with non-dotted arrows. The numbered arrows between the elements represent influences and interactions between IPBES components that are researched in this study. Only those inclusive categories referring to each of the components are shown in the diagram, but see  Díaz et al. (2015)    [24]  for the categories referring to western science and indigenous and local knowledge. resources  [23, 24] . Indirect drivers of change refer to those underlying causes of changes that are exogenous to the social-ecological system, such as changes in economy, demography, culture or lifestyles  [23, 24, 36] . The conceptual framework of IPBES emphasizes the key role of institutions as they determine the access to and control over NCP  (Fig 1) . Moreover, people's quality of life can trigger institutional responses in the form of management actions aiming to either minimize the negative impacts of drivers of change or maximise the provision of beneficial NCP  (Fig 1)    [19, 36, 37] . As mountains are essential providers of NCP  [3, 4]  and face multiple drivers of change  [4] , examining previous research on NCP is important for identifying knowledge gaps and ways to design future research agendas. In this paper, we analyze to what extent former research on ecosystem services conducted in mountains has explored the different components of the IPBES conceptual framework and social-ecological interactions with interdisciplinary lenses. We finally discuss the most important research gaps and ways to move forward the research agenda of NCP in mountains in order to support IPBES. 
 Methods We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed scientific articles written in English on ecosystem services in mountainous regions worldwide using the Web of Science and Scopus databases. We followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) for conducting systematic reviews. PRISMA was published to set standards in the reporting of systematic reviews in 2009 [38] and has proved essential for increasing both reporting and methodological quality  [39] . The PRISMA checklist of rules for this study is given in S1  Table.  To avoid double counting, we searched for primary research articles and excluded reviews and conference proceedings. The search string used for the review comprised three main elements: (1) mountainous systems (e.g. mountain, highland, paramo or summit) and regions (e.g. Andes, Alps, Himalaya, Ghats or Kilimanjaro), (2) assessment and valuation (e.g. evaluation, assessment, valuation, mapping, quantification or estimation) and (3) ecosystem services (e.g. ecosystem service, ecosystem good, environmental service or ecosystem function). We included in the search string the term 'ecosystem function' to find publications that researched the benefits derived from ecosystem functions, thus qualifying as ecosystem services, without mentioning the term 'ecosystem service' or 'environmental service'. Although we used the IPBES framework, it is important to point out that the terms of 'nature's contributions to people' and 'nature's benefits to people' (see  [24] ) have not been used yet in mountains research and therefore their use in the search string does not provide any results. For the full search string, see S1 Text. The search was applied to Abstract, Title and Keywords of published papers between 1997 and 2016. The search returned 580 papers (S1  Fig).  Based on the screening of titles and abstracts, we disregarded 60 papers that were conceptual, theoretical or reviews or were not conducted in mountains (S1  Fig).  In a second step, we assessed the eligibility of the papers by reading the full text. In this step, besides the same criteria used in the first screening, we also excluded those papers whose full text was not available in English, and those that mentioned the term 'ecosystem service' without assessing, valuing or mapping any ecosystem service. A final set of 213 papers were selected for in-depth analyses (S1  Fig).  S2 Text provides the final list of 213 papers included in this research. As we are aware that ecosystem service research is a fast evolving field with increasing numbers of publications each year, we also reviewed 10% of the 310 papers that met the screening criteria of a total of 413 papers that were returned after applying the search methodology to papers published between 2017 and 2018. Analyses of these additional papers was undertaken to confirm that the patterns of ecosystem service research found in this study are consistent with current literature from 2017-2018. S3 Text provides a synthesis of the results of the review of 10% of the papers for 2017 and 2018. The information extracted from each paper was organized in a database according to (1) characteristics of the publication (i.e. year of publication and journal); (2) study location; (3) methodological approach (i.e. biophysical, socio-cultural, economic and plural approaches, which included different methods from natural and social sciences [40]); (4) component of the IPBES framework analyzed; (5) the element of nature (i.e. species, community, functional diversity and biodiversity in its broad sense); (6) NCP categories; (7) dimensions of good quality of life; (8) direct drivers of change; (9) indirect drivers of change; and (10) institutional responses, particularly if they referred to protected areas, legislation or market-based schemes, such as payments for ecosystem services. Although institutional responses are also indirect drivers of change, in this paper we distinguished between the two: while indirect drivers of change refer to those policy changes that have jeopardized the capacity of mountains to continue providing NCP, institutional responses refer to those management actions that deliberately seek to preserve NCP. This distinction also aligns with the IPBES conceptual framework since it emphasizes the key role of institutional responses to manage and preserve nature and NCP  [24] . To classify NCP, we used the 18 categories of the IPBES generalizing perspective [34]. These categories were grouped into regulating, material and non-material NCP  [34] . It is important to note that, as we reviewed the literature on ecosystem services, we only considered those beneficial or positive NCP. Despite the initial debate about the added value of NCP in current research [41-43], we consider that it can provide useful insights for fostering future research in mountains for two reasons. First, as the paradigm of NCP considers local ecological knowledge as a relevant source of information [34], its application can help to (1) reveal benefits that have been overlooked in scans of previous research on the topic and (2) foster sociocultural approaches that have been less developed in ecosystem service research  [44] [45] [46] [47] . For example, drawing on the local knowledge of shepherds in different mountain ranges of Spain, Morales-Reyes et al.  [48]  found that carcass removal provided by large carnivores and vultures was an essential beneficial contribution that reduces the economic costs of farms. To date, the beneficial NCP of scavenging has not been considered in standard classifications of ecosystem services, including those from the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment  [23] , the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity [49] and the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services  [50] . Therefore, while encompassing the ecosystem services framework, the paradigm of NCP enables new beneficial and detrimental contributions that have been historically overlooked in former classifications of ecosystem services to be uncovered. In addition, the paradigm of NCP acknowledges that one particular contribution can simultaneously belong to the different categories of material, non-material and regulating. This has special relevance for mountains as particular contributions such as gathering of wild food (e.g. mushrooms, asparagus or berries), hunting and fishing can be considered both material and non-material NCP because they provide nutritional benefits and recreational enjoyment  [51] . Dimensions of good quality of life included fulfilling the needs of basic materials (i.e. ability to access resources to gain a livelihood and earn income), health, security, good social relationships, and freedom of choice and action  [23] . Direct drivers of change were classified as landuse change, climate change, overexploitation of natural resources, invasive alien species and pollution  [23, 24]  and indirect drivers of change were classified as policy changes (i.e. changes in conservation and agricultural policies), changes in cultural values, demographic changes (i.e. rural abandonment and population growth), and market forces  [23] . We conducted network analysis to explore to what extent interactions between the different abovementioned components of the IPBES framework were analyzed in the scientific literature of ecosystem services provided by mountains. In the networks, nodes represent the biodiversity levels, categories of NCP, dimensions of wellbeing, direct and indirect drivers of change and institutional responses. Then, when two specific components were analyzed together in the same publication, we paired them using undirected links. The interlinkages between the nodes (i.e. edges) represent the number of co-occurrences between the different components of the IPBES framework. Thus, the weight of edges was calculated according to the number of papers in which a pair of nodes appears together  [52] . This process resulted in four undirected weighted networks, which were built according to four periods of time:  1997-2007, 2008-2010, 2011-2013, and 2014-2016 . These periods were selected after analyzing historical trends in ecosystem services publications, in particular the length of each period (i.e. 3 years, except the first period which is an open interval: 2007 and before) and a similar growth rate of publications in each period (which ranges between 45% and 69%)  (Fig 2) . To determine to what extent the nodes representing each IPBES component were relevant in shaping ecosystem service research on mountains in each time period, we calculated two measures of centrality: weighted degree and betweenness. The weighted degree of a given node measures the sum of the weights (i.e., numbers of publications in our analysis) of the edges connecting this node to the others [53]. Betweenness measures how many times a node relates to other nodes which would be otherwise disconnected  [54, 55] . Therefore betweenness for a particular component of the IPBES framework (node) is measured as the number of shortest paths that pass through this node divided by all existing shortest paths in the network  [52] . This centrality metric is thus able to identify which specific components of the IPBES framework act as linkages and connect otherwise disparate components. Along with the centrality metrics, we also calculated the density of the network, which is the proportion of node pairs out of the total number of possible pairs in the network [52]. Thus, density indicates to what extent the research on ecosystem services provided by mountains included the interlinkages between the different components of the conceptual framework of IPBES. We created the networks and calculated the centrality metrics using the NodeXL and Gephi software. 
 Results 
 Temporal trends and geographical distribution The volume of scientific papers on ecosystem services in mountains (reviewed in this research) has rapidly increased since 2008, consistent with the general development of ecosystem service research. Four periods can be distinguished within the overall trend (   (Fig 2) . We also found that these four periods are characterized by different methodological approaches for assessing ecosystem services  (Fig 2) . Whilst in the first and second periods more than 60% of the papers (n = 9 and n = 20, respectively) applied biophysical methods, this decreased to 36% in 2014-2016 (n = 38). By contrast, socio-cultural methodological approaches increased from 7% and 6% of publications in the first and second periods (n = 1 and n = 2), respectively, to 20% in the fourth period (n = 18). Economic valuation methods were mainly applied before 2007 (20% of publications; n = 3) and in 2010-2013 (16% of publications; n = 12). Plural and integrated assessments, in which different methodological approaches were applied, gradually increased from 13% of publications (n = 2) before 2007 to 35% of publications (n = 32) in 2014-2016. Overall, biophysical assessment methods were the most applied (47% of publications; n = 100), followed by plural and integrated assessments (29%; n = 61), economic valuation (13%; n = 28) and socio-cultural approaches (11%; n = 23). The studies addressing ecosystem services in mountains are unevenly distributed geographically  (Fig 3) . The largest part of the studies focused on European mountains (34.9% of publications; n = 74), mostly in Switzerland (26.0% of European publications; n = 19), Italy (21.9%; n = 16), France (20.5%; n = 15) and Spain (15.1%; n = 11). However, the country with the highest number of publications is China (13.4% of publications; n = 28), followed by the United States (10.0%; n = 21). By contrast, the Andes in Latin America presented few studies (8.9% of publications; n = 19) relative to their extension, as well as the South draining parts of the Himalayas and Central Asian mountain ranges  (Fig 3) . Moreover, we did not find studies addressing ecosystem services in other mountain ranges, such as the Ural Mountains and the Armenian and the Anatolian Plateaus  (Fig 3) . 
 Coverage of different components of social-ecological systems Research on ecosystem services in mountains covered the component of nature in 37.6% of publications (n = 80), with the coverage decreasing across the four time periods  (Fig 4) . Amongst the organizational levels of biodiversity, 16.9% of publications (n = 36) evaluated the level of species or populations, followed by the community level (11.3% of publications; n = 24)  (Fig 5A) . Only 2.3% of publications (n = 5) approached biodiversity from the functional diversity perspective and 4.2% (n = 9) referred to biodiversity in its broad sense (  Fig  5A) . Fifty-six percent of publications (n = 119) assessed more than one category of NCP (  Fig  5A) . From the remaining 44.2% of publications, 28.2% (n = 60) assessed only regulating NCP, 12.2% (n = 26) assessed only material NCP and 3.8% (n = 8) focused only on non-material NCP. Despite regulating NCP being the category that received the most scientific attention overall, their proportion decreased across the four time periods  (Fig 4) . By contrast, research on material and non-material NCP slightly increased  (Fig 4) . The NCP that received the highest scientific attention were physical and psychological experiences (50.7% of publications; n = 108), which encompassed recreational experiences (30.5% of publications; n = 65) and aesthetic enjoyment  (   Ecosystem service research in mountains and good social relationships were rarely assessed (5.6% and 4.2%; n = 19 and n = 9, respectively)  (Fig 5A) . Impacts of drivers of change on nature and NCP were assessed very frequently, with 89.2% of publications (n = 190): 33.8% of publications (n = 72) assessed both direct and indirect drivers of change, 44.1% of publications (n = 94) assessed only direct drivers and 11.3% of publications (n = 24) assessed only indirect drivers  (Fig 5A) . The trend of assessing both drivers of change was relatively stable across the four periods of time, from 33.3% in the 1997-2007 period (n = 5) to 31.2% in the 2014-2016 period (n = 29). Although direct drivers of change were assessed in 77.5% of the publications (n = 165), their prevalence declined across the four time periods  (Fig 4)     (Fig 5B) . Regarding indirect drivers, 31.1% of the publications (n = 51) explored the impact of current conservation policies on nature and NCP, followed by the impact of markets (23.2% of publications on indirect drivers; n = 38), agricultural policies (17.1%; n = 28) and cultural change (15.2%; n = 25). Demographic changes, either emigration from rural areas or human population growth, were rarely covered in the literature (6.7% of publications each; n = 11)  (Fig 5B) . Finally, institutional responses to preserve nature and NCP in mountains were only addressed by 32.9% of publications (n = 70)  (Fig 4) . The consideration of conservation measures, both protected areas and market-based instruments (e.g. payments for ecosystem services, habitat banking) increased over the four time periods from 20.0% in 1997-2007 (n = 3) to 34.3% in 2014-2016 (n = 32)  (Fig 4) . Particularly, the consideration of market-based schemes increased from 6.  
 Interrelations between social-ecological system components Research on ecosystem services in mountains has increasingly considered the complex interactions between indirect and direct drivers, nature, NCP, human wellbeing and institutional responses over the four time periods  (Fig 6) . Thus, the density of the networks has slightly increased over the first three periods, i.e   (Fig 6) . The increases in the number of components and in network density (i.e., number of edges) could have resulted only from the increasing number of publications over time  (Fig 2) . The simulation of random datasets and associated networks showed that this was true for the number of components but not for network density (S4 Text). The increase in the number of components resulted from the increasing number of publications over time, as more publications were likely to cover a larger number of topics. But the high network density in the last time period could be not explained only by the large number of papers (S4 Text). In other terms, the most recent papers considered more diverse combinations of topics. An increasing number of publications have assessed the interactive effects of different indirect drivers of change on fostering land-use change and climate change, as well as, the impact of these direct drivers on different NCP, namely food and feed, materials, climate regulation, soil formation, regulation of freshwater quality and quantity, habitat maintenance and physical experiences, such as recreation and aesthetic enjoyment  (Fig 6) . Similarly, the interlinkages between NCP and human wellbeing have been increasingly researched since 2011. In the last period (2014-2016), numerous publications have addressed the interlinkages between material and regulating NCP on basic materials, security, and health  (Fig 6) . By contrast, interlinkages between biodiversity and NCP received less attention in this period  (Fig 6) . The IPBES components with highest weighted degree and betweenness also changed over time, although the impact of land-use change on biodiversity was consistently represented across the four periods of time. Until 2007, the regulating NCP of freshwater quality regulation, habitat maintenance and regulation of natural hazards, together with the nonmaterial NCP of physical experiences and the pressure of land-use change were the components with the highest weighted degree and betweenness  (Fig 6A; S2 Table) . These regulating and non-material NCP, as well as land-use change, were the main focus of ecosystem service research in mountains and were also critical in connecting with other components of the IPBES framework. In the period 2008-2010, only the components of land-use change (direct driver of change) and the regulating NCP of soil formation presented high weighted degree and betweenness  (Fig 6B; S3 Table) . In 2011-2013, two material NCP (food and feed, and materials) together with regulation of climate presented the highest weighted degree and betweenness  (Fig 6C; S4 Table) . In this third period, the institutional response represented by conservation policies also appeared among the most important components (S4  Table) . In the last period (2014-2016), components with the highest weighted degree were again the regulating NCP of freshwater quality and the direct driver of land-use change. However, new components also appeared as important, such as the NCP of physical experiences in nature, conservation responses, the indirect driver of changes in markets, and two components of wellbeing (i.e. basic material for a good life and security)  (Fig 6D; S5 Table) . In this period, the element with the highest betweenness was the non-material NCP of learning (S5  Table) . 
 Discussion This review presents the status of ecosystem service science in mountains by applying the IPBES conceptual framework as an analytical lens. In doing so, we identified major research gaps that should be addressed to provide interdisciplinary understanding of the status and trends of beneficial NCP in mountains. Addressing these gaps would contribute to future IPBES assessments  [24]  by providing an integrated understanding of the interlinkages between NCP, biodiversity, people's quality of life, drivers of change and institutional responses. Current knowledge gaps found in this study include: (1) the interlinkages between biodiversity and NCP and between NCP and people's quality of life (arrows 1 and 2 of  Fig 1) ; (2) the effect of indirect drivers of change on direct drivers and on NCP (arrows 5 and 7 of  Fig 1) ; (3) particular geographical areas, such as the Andes, the South draining parts of the Himalayas and Central Asian mountain ranges, the Ural Mountains and the Armenian and the Anatolian Plateaus  (Fig 3) ; and (4) particular aspects of the IPBES components, specifically functional diversity, non-material NCP, the wellbeing dimensions of social relationships, health and freedom of choice, and the effect of demographic and cultural changes on NCP  (Fig 5) . Some methodological limitations should be noted. First, this systematic review might overlook some of the research on specific ecosystem services in mountains because there may be publications that study ecosystem services without referring to them as ecosystem service, environmental service, ecosystem good or ecosystem function (see S1 Text). However, the aim of this study was to determine to what extent ecosystem service science in mountains has explored the different components of the IPBES conceptual framework, and therefore our search deliberately targeted those publications that had used the ecosystem service framework. Second, although we used the IPBES conceptual framework, we did not research detrimental NCP in mountains. Although detrimental NCP (or ecosystem disservices) have been increasingly studied in the scientific literature, research on this topic is still relatively marginal and is mainly focused on urban and agricultural systems and on biological invasions  [56] [57] [58] [59] . Therefore, future research is needed on detrimental NCP in mountains. Third, this study synthesizes the existing literature on ecosystem services in mountains and summarizes the interlinkages between the main components of the IPBES conceptual framework  (Fig 1) ; however we do not provide the magnitude of the effect of one component over others and we do not analyze what factors trigger or jeopardize the provision of NCP. Although such information would be vital for decision-making, the results of our systematic review can still be useful for identifying what components of the IPBES conceptual framework need to be further researched in order to support future IPBES and national assessments. In addition, the results provided in this study can also contribute towards future agendas for mountain research by targeting those components that have been overlooked so far. Fourth, the search strategy used in this study allows the evaluation of the entire spectrum of research on ecosystem services in mountains up to 2016 (see S3 Text for the trends in 2017-2018), rather than focusing mainly on influential and top cited publications such as previous reviews on ecosystem service research  [60] [61] [62] . However, as the search was done in English and dismissed gray literature in order to ensure the quality of studies included in the systematic review  [63] , an inherent bias may exist toward studies from countries with more capacity for publishing in international English-language journals. In fact, most of the studies on ecosystem services provided by mountains were conducted in Europe  (Fig 3) , a pattern that is consistent with previous systematic reviews on ecosystem services  [18, 62, 64, 65] . Therefore, future systematic reviews on ecosystem service research need to recognize and include the knowledge built by researchers across Africa, South America and Asia  [66] . In this sense, the recently published IPBES regional assessments represent an excellent example of including the knowledge around biodiversity and ecosystem services published in multiple languages and different formats, including gray literature  [26] [27] [28] [29] . 
 Ecosystem service research in mountains over time The temporal trend of ecosystem service research in mountains indicates that the number of scientific publications has increased over time until 2013, when the number of publications per year stabilized  (Fig 2) . Yet, ecosystem service research in mountains has led to fewer publications than in other ecosystems, such as agroecosystems  [67]  or urban systems  [45] . The underrepresentation of mountains in ecosystem service research relative to other systems is consistent with other related fields, such as conservation biology  [68]  or ecology  [69] . Alongside the increasing number of publications, research on ecosystem services in mountains has gradually studied more interlinkages between regulating and non-material NCP, dimensions of quality of life, and direct and indirect drivers of change  (Fig 6) . Likewise, methodological approaches have moved towards plural and integrated methodological approaches that required different disciplines  (Fig 2) . This result is consistent with the current pattern of ecosystem service research which has become more interdisciplinary  [60, 70]  as a result of recent calls for integrating diverse values of NCP  [71] [72] [73]  and for including knowledge from social sciences and humanities  [74] [75] [76] , particularly in IPBES assessments [34,  [77] [78] [79] . Despite this recent recognition of the relevance of social sciences and humanities, socio-cultural methodological approaches are still less applied than biophysical and economic approaches in mountain research  (Fig 2) . This result is also consistent with previous systematic reviews on ecosystem services provided by agroecosystems [46], marine and coastal systems [47] and urban systems  [44, 45] . The abovementioned temporal evolution of research on ecosystem services in mountains aligns with the evolution of topics identified by Droste et al.  [70]  in ecosystem services, despite some differences in the temporal periods used for analysis. Droste et al.  [70]  found that ecosystem service research was founded on natural science with a focus on nature conservation and that economic valuation also played a major part between 1990 and 2010. In this research, we found that biophysical approaches focusing on biodiversity and regulating NCP as well as on the impact of direct drivers of change on biodiversity were dominant in the first period (1997-2007) of ecosystem service research in mountains  (Figs 2 and 4) , but we also found that economic valuation played an important role in this period  (Fig 2) . This result contradicts previous reviews of ecosystem service research that claimed the sole dominance of economic approaches in the period of 1990-2000  [60, 80] . Similar to the findings of Chaudhary et al.  [60]  and Droste et al.  [70] , we found that in the last two periods of time (i.e. 2011-2013 and 2014-2016), ecosystem service research in mountains seeks to enhance the understanding of socialecological systems by increasing the research on social aspects, such as people's quality of life and indirect drivers of change  (Figs 4 and 6) . In these periods, we also observed that ecosystem service research became more policy-oriented by focusing more on the institutional responses associated with protected areas and market-based schemes, such as REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) programs and payments for ecosystem services  (Figs 4 and 6 ). 
 Components of the IPBES conceptual framework studied in ecosystem service research in mountains Besides the component on NCP (considered by all studies), the component of the IPBES conceptual framework on direct drivers of change was the second most frequently considered (77.5% of publications) followed by indirect drivers of change (45.0%). Yet, while research on direct drivers has decreased over time, research focusing on indirect drivers has increased  (Fig  4) . This result is consistent with global trends of science and recent findings of the IPBES regional assessments that show robust evidence regarding the impact of direct drivers of change, particularly land-use and climate change, on biodiversity and NCP  [23, 26, 28, 29, 81] . By contrast, the effect of indirect drivers of change still remains as an important knowledge gap, in particular the effect of institutional responses on NCP  (Fig 5) . The fact that land-use change was by far the most studied direct driver (Figs 5B and 6) can be explained because it is the most important pressure affecting biodiversity and NCP  [28, 29, 81] . In ecosystem service research, climate change has received less scientific attention than land-use change despite the fact that its impact on NCP is rapidly increasing worldwide  [26] [27] [28] [29] , particularly in mountains  [16, 82] . However, this result may be misleading because the climate change scientific community does not often use the framework of ecosystem services  [83]  even though researchers are studying the impacts of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (e.g.  [84] [85] [86] ). In addition, possible synergistic effects of land-use change and climate change on NCP in mountains  [87] [88] [89] , in both the present and future, are underexplored  [88, 90] . Regarding indirect drivers of change, policies and markets are the most prominent in ecosystem service research in mountains, followed by cultural change and agricultural policies  (Figs 5B and 6 ). This result also supports the findings from the IPBES regional assessments that concluded that patterns of economic growth and trade as well as ineffective and inappropriate policies have accelerated the loss of biodiversity and NCP  [26] [27] [28] [29] . The IPBES regional assessments also identified population growth and urbanization as relevant drivers causing biodiversity decline  [26] [27] [28] [29] . By contrast, in mountains, rural abandonment has been increasingly considered as an indirect driver  (Fig 6) . In summary, indirect drivers associated with demographic changes, changes on cultural values and policy changes that underpin societal behavior are little understood and overall require more in-depth research in mountains  [91, 92] . Regarding the component of nature in the IPBES conceptual framework, this systematic review shows that the study of biodiversity in ecosystem service research in mountains has decreased over time  (Fig 4) . Although biodiversity is critical for the provision of NCP  [24, 93, 94] , much uncertainty remains over the interlinkages between biodiversity components and the different categories of NCP  [25, 95] . In particular, the biodiversity component of functional diversity is the least studied in mountains  (Fig 5A)  despite its relevance for the provision of NCP  [96, 97] . This result is consistent with the strong bias toward agroecosystems and forests found by  Hevia et al. [45]  in a systematic review on the links between direct drivers of change and ecosystem services via functional traits. The recent emergence of functional diversity and modelling and mapping approaches can contribute to enhancing knowledge about biodiversity-ecosystem services linkages and the synergies and trade-offs between biodiversity and ecosystem services in mountains (e.g.  [98] [99] [100] ). The decreasing trend of research on biodiversity-ecosystem services linkages might be associated with the declining trend of research on regulating NCP  (Fig 4) . Nevertheless, regulating NCP were the most researched in mountains  (Fig 5A) , particularly the categories of regulation of climate, regulation of freshwater quality and quantity, soil formation and habitat maintenance  (Fig 6; S2 Fig) . Research on material and non-material NCP slightly increased over time  (Fig 4) , particularly the categories of food and feed, materials, physical experiences and supporting identities  (Fig 6; S2 Fig) . Nevertheless, non-material NCP are the category less studied in mountains  (Fig 5A)  despite the claim that mountains are hotspots of scenic beauty, recreation and spiritual enjoyment  [9, 100] . The fact that non-material NCP remained underexplored in ecosystem service research in mountains can explain the significant shortcomings in understanding the contributions of nature to people's quality of life, particularly the dimensions of social relationships and freedom of choice (  Fig 5A) . Only 34.3% of the studies connect NCP with people's quality of life, particularly with material needs (e.g.  [82, 100, 101] )  (Fig 5) . This result supports the findings from Grêt-Regamey et al.  [3] , showing that only 20% of publications on ecosystem services in mountains connected ecosystem functions with human wellbeing. In addition, research linking NCP with quality of life is framed in a simplistic way, mainly looking at the interactions between regulating and material NCP with basic materials or the effect of land-use change and climate change on livelihoods security (e.g.  [82, 102] )  (Fig 6) . 
 Moving towards policy-oriented research on ecosystem services in mountains Ecosystem service research in mountains appears to have focused less on the institutional responses than other components of the IPBES conceptual framework  (Fig 4) , although it has become more policy-and action-oriented over time. The institutional responses assessed in the literature mainly focus on market-based schemes (  Fig 5A) . Indeed, REDD+ programs and payments for ecosystem services have increasingly been explored as management options in mountains across Latin America (e.g.  [101, 103, 104] ), Asia (e.g.  [105, 106] ) and Africa (e.g.  [107] [108] [109] ). The programs of payments for ecosystem services assessed in the scientific literature on mountains seek to secure water, reduce deforestation and conserve local ecosystem services while enhancing the livelihoods of communities and eradicating poverty. By contrast, the reviewed literature on protected areas as institutional responses assessed changes in NCP in response to different conservation policies (e.g.  [110, 111] ). In addition to these two institutional responses, NCP in mountains are also managed by informal institutions, such as community-based management. Community-based management is particularly relevant in the case of material NCP in forests (e.g. fuelwood, timber, and edible and medicinal plants) (e.g.  [112] [113] [114] ), supporting identities (e.g. sacred ceremonies, sense of place) (e.g.  [112, 115, 116] ) and regulation of freshwater quantity and quality (e.g.  [117] [118] [119] ). Research on communitybased management in mountains focuses on sustaining the flow of NCP while simultaneously improving livelihoods, securing food, water and energy and fostering social relationships. The fact that community-based management remains underexplored may be explained by the few published analyses of social relationships as dimension of quality of life  (Fig 5A) . In-depth research on effective governance systems of ecosystem services in mountains is needed to find effective management actions that guarantee the sustainable flow of NCP while fulfilling the needs of different social actors and reducing poverty. Therefore, addressing this knowledge gap is essential to foster robust governance models that support sustainable management of NCP in mountains. Supporting information S1  Table.

This category encompassed supporting cultural identity and sense of belonging (16.4% of publications; n = 35), the satisfaction derived from knowing that a particular landscape and species exists (7.0%; n = 15) and supporting sacred and spiritual rituals (5.6%; n = 12). The regulating NCP that received the highest scientific attention was regulation of climate (45.5%; n = 97), followed by soil formation (41.8% of publications; n = 89), regulation of freshwater quality (39.4%; n = 84) and quantity (32.9%; n = 70) and habitat maintenance (31.9%; n = 68) (S2 Fig). Provision of food and feed (46.0%; n = 98) was the material NCP that received the highest scientific attention, followed by the provision wood and fibres (32.8% and 30.5% of publications; n = 70 and n = 65, respectively) (S2 Fig). Quality of life was only assessed in 34.3% of publications (n = 73) on ecosystem services in mountains, although it presented an increasing trend from 26.7% of the articles (n = 57) in the period 1997-2007 to 38.0% in 2014-2016 (n = 81)(Fig 4). Amongst the dimensions of good quality of life, the category of basic materials received the highest scientific attention (27.2% of publications; n = 58), followed by security (10.3%; n = 22).

 NEW TRENDS AND CHALLENGES 
 FOOD SYSTEMS EMISSION AND CLIMATE CHANGE CONSEQUENCES Julien Demenois 1 , Géraldine Chaboud 2 and Vincent Blanfort 3 
 Contribution of food systems to climate change Food systems are a major driver of environmental effects, including climate change. They have contributed to the crossing of several of the proposed 'planetary boundaries' that attempt to define a safe operating space for humanity on a stable Earth system, in particular those concerning climate change  (Springmann et al., 2018) . The Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land-Use sector (AFOLU) is responsible for just under a quarter (≈10-12 GtCO 2 eq/yr) of anthropogenic GHG emissions, mainly from deforestation and agricultural emissions from livestock, soil and nutrient management  (Smith et al., 2014) . Annual direct GHG emissions from agricultural production in 2000-2010 have been estimated at 5.0-5.8 GtCO 2 eq/yr  (Smith et al., 2014) , including emissions from biomass burning (12 percent) and energy use in agricultural machinery  (Vermeulen et al., 2012) . Indirect GHG emissions from the pre-production stages (mainly the manufacture of fertilisers) have been estimated at 0.35-0.77 GtCO 2 eq/yr and post-production stages (processing, packaging, transport, refrigeration, retail, catering, food management and waste disposal) at 1.1 GtCO 2 eq/yr  (Vermeulen et al., 2012) . So, food systems contribute between 19 and 29 percent of total anthropogenic GHG emissions. Agricultural production is by far the main source of emissions in LI and LMI countries, while postproduction stages emit GHG emissions equal to the production stages in HI countries  (Vermeulen et al., 2012) . Although there is little information available, an estimated onethird of the food produced in the world for human consumption is lost or wasted during the production to consumption stages  (Gustavsson et al., 2011; HLPE, 2014) . In HI countries, most food loss and waste (FLW) occurs at the downstream stages of the food supply chain (retail and consumption) and is related to patterns of over-production and over-consumption. In LI and LMI countries, FLW is supposed to mostly occur at the upstream stages (harvest, storage, transport and processing) due to infrastructural, financial and technical constraints  (Gustavsson et al., 2011) . FLW represents a significant use of natural resources along food supply chains and pollution is emitted in vain. FLW contributes to GHG emissions in two ways: through waste management activities (for example, disposal in landfill) and through the embedded emissions associated with its production, processing, transport, retailing and consumption. The latter are far more important in terms of impact than the former. The carbon footprint of FLW has been estimated at 3.3 GtCO 2 equivalent (excluding GHG emissions from land-use changes). Reducing FLW by one half would reduce environmental pressures by between 6 and 16 percent compared with the baseline projection for 2050  (Springmann et al., 2018) . 
 S U M M A R Y Food systems are responsible for up to one-third of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These emissions include carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and are therefore a major driver of climate change. The environmental pressures on food systems are likely to intensify, as humanity is arguably already operating beyond planetary boundaries. The projection for changes between 2010 and 2050 shows that these pressures will result in an increase of between 80 and 92 percent in GHG emissions in the absence of technological change and other mitigation measures. Apart from being a significant source of GHG emissions, food systems are significantly impacted by climate change. Uneven climate change effects, in combination with differences in adaptation capacity, could exacerbate existing inequalities between High-Income (HI), Low-Income (LI) and Lower Middle-Income (LMI) countries. 
 Impact of climate change on food systems Apart from being a significant source of GHG emissions, climate change is affecting people and the environment around the world, as shown by the 2018 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World (FAO, 2018) also found climate change to be one of the key drivers behind the rise of hungry people in the world, reaching 821 million people in 2017. By the middle of this century, higher average temperatures, changes in precipitation, rising sea levels, as well as the possibility of an increase in damage from pests and diseases, are expected to affect several agricultural sectors. In particular, the number and frequency of recorded natural disasters are increasing significantly. These events often destroy critical agricultural assets and infrastructure, disrupting production cycles, trade flows and livelihoods. This affects food security and causes additional disruptions throughout value chains  (FAO, 2017) . Indeed, extreme weather events and geopolitical crises are the dominant drivers of food production shocks, even if their relative importance varies across sectors  (Cottrell et al., 2019) . Over half of all shocks to crop production systems have been the result of extreme weather events, reinforcing concern about the vulnerability of arable systems to climatic and meteorological volatility around the globe. In addition, climate change will impact livestock production, as well as fisheries and aquaculture, the performance of small-and medium-sized food and agribusinesses, transportation infrastructure with consequent disruption to food supply chains and the exodus of climate refugees. This impact will be uneven across regions and countries. Arid and semi-arid regions will be exposed to even lower precipitation and higher temperatures and, consequently, experience yield losses. Conversely, countries in temperate areas are expected to benefit from warmer weather during their growing season. Faced with climate change, LI and LMI countries are the most vulnerable and it could exacerbate the food security challenges they already experience. For example, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, particularly West Africa, have been found to be the hardest-hit regions, partly due to higher climateinduced crop yield losses and because their national economies depend on agriculture for a significant share of GDP and employment. Simultaneously, small-scale family farmers have little access to innovative technologies, services and inputs, which limits their capacity to adapt to a changing climate. As a result, these regions are expected to experience a significant drop in agricultural production due to climate change (cf. Map 7) and imports of agricultural products are expected to increase. Uneven climate change effects, in combination with differences in adaptation capacity, could exacerbate existing inequalities and further widen the gap between HI and LI and LMI countries  (FAO, 2018) . • BOX 1 future climate risk in southern mali 1 Crop yield losses caused by climate change are expected to be high in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa and smallholder farmers, who rely heavily on agriculture for their livelihoods, have been identified as highly vulnerable to climate change. In southern Mali, a study has assessed the future climate change risk according to farm type and degree of food self-sufficiency. It shows that cereal crop production in the region of N'Tarla in southern Mali is gravely threatened by climate change. Some 40 percent of the country's population lives in this region, which represents half of Mali's cultivable land. The current climate is typical of the Sudano-Sahelian zone of West Africa with conditions that are already drier and temperatures, which are warmer. Predictions suggest that the current climate warming trend will continue and even accelerate. By mid-century (2040-2069) annual maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to increase by 2.9 °C and 3.3 °C respectively compared with the climate trend of the past 30 years . Rising temperatures are expected to have a critical impact on crop yields by reducing the length of the crop growth cycle and increasing the intensity and duration of droughts due to larger soil water evaporation losses. Under these future climate conditions and without changing current cropping practices, simulation models predict crop yield losses and a reduction of food availability for all farm types, and this is in an area where most of the population of is already facing food insecurity problems. However, the adverse impact of climate change will differ among farmers if coping strategies are adopted. Projections show that large-and medium-sized farms can offset the yield losses induced by climate change and remain food self-sufficient with crop management solutions such as early planting and increased fertiliser use. In contrast, results show that any of these adaptive crop management measures would not be enough to protect small farms from the negative consequences of climate change on crop productivity and food self-sufficiency. These smallholders will remain food insecure. Farmers will need off-farm employment or other forms of social support to cope with climate change. The results of this study are in line with many other studies and model predictions showing that agricultural performance in sub-Saharan Africa is likely to be strongly affected by future climate change. 			 .

 Materials and methods Study was conducted in the East, Southeast, South, Southwest, Central West and West zones of Côte d'Ivoire. The humid. Amonomodal rainfall pattern is located in the west and bimodal in the other zones. Average rainfall ranging from 1100 to 2300mm per year 10 . Mean annual temperatures range between 24 and 32°C 11 . The average insolation duration is greater than 1900 hours per . Relative humidity (over 80%) is high throughout the . The majority of the soils of the Ivorian coffee zone are . There are characterized by an exchangeable base sum of less than 8meq/100g of soil, a saturation of the adsorbent complex of less than 80% and an oscillating pH between 4.5 and 6.5 8 . Sampling: A total of 156 soil sample were collected from adult coffee plantations between September and December 2014. In each plot, 30 elemental surface samples of 0-20cm horizons, distributed over two diagonal lines, were collected using a cylindrical auger on an average area of 1 ha. The chosen depth corresponds to the horizons where 90% of the absorbent roots are located as described by  Hatert 14  . The samples were then mixed to form a 1kg composite sample representative of the field. The GPS coordinates of each parcel were recorded using a GPS (garmin 62) to connect the samples to the corresponding map units. 
 Physical and chemical measures: The samples were dried and screened on 2 mm mesh before being crushed and analyzed at the Laboratory of Plant and Soil Analysis (LAVESO) in Yamoussoukro. Soils were analyzed following methodology outlined by Pansu and Gautheryou 15 . Particle sizes was separated with ""international Robinson pipette method"". The pH was determined pH-meter after addition of 50 ml of ionized water to 20g of soil followed by stirring and decantation. Organic carbon content was determined by the Walkley-Black method. The nitrogen (N) was measured using the Kjeldahl method. Available phosphorus was quantified using the modified Olsenmethod Dabin. The exchangeable bases (K, Ca and Mg) were determined after extraction with an ammonium acetate solution (NH 4 OAC) at pH 7 (Metson method). Potassium was measured using a flame spectrophotometry, whereas Ca and Mg were quantified using atomic absorption. The CEC at pH 7 is determined after displacement of the NH4 + ions by KCl on the pellet of the saturated sample remaining after extraction of the bases. Statistical analysis: Statistical analyzes were carried out according to methods described by Pages, Hussonand Lê with free software R 3.0.2  16  . View the large number of criteria (quantitative variables) to qualify an ""individual"" factorial analyzes were used. Plots located on the same map unit constituted an average person. Principal component analysis (PCA) was using to analyze measured parameters and visualize in the form of a cloud the map units with similar physicochemical profiles. Then the Ascending Hierarchical Classification (CAH) was carried out on the results of the ACP to group and describe the types of soils presenting the same physicochemical characteristics. 
 Results and discussion Overview of soil mapping units:  Table-1 and Table-2   The C/N ratio varied between 7 and 12 with an average of 9.5. The soil pH is slightly acidic. The soil reaction range is between 5.1 and 6.3 with an average soil pH of 5.7. The average value of the available phosphorus (Pav) was 70.42 mg.kg -1 . Potassium (K) average was 0.22 cmol(+).kg -1 in the range of 0.15 to 0.54 cmol(+).kg -1 . Calcium (Ca) was ranged from 1.95 to 6.89 cmol(+).kg -1 . Magnesium was ranged from 0.8 to 2.81 cmol(+).kg -1 . Soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) varied between 10 and 18 cmol(+).kg -1 . Bases saturation was between 27 and 88%. (Ca + Mg)/K ratios were variable  (15 to 30) .  It is noted that the first dimension of variability is between soils relatively rich in mineral elements and with relatively low levels of available phosphorus in soils with low levels of mineral elements. The second dimension of variability opposes soils with a relatively larger adsorbent complex than the others. Soils from shale are relatively more physicochemical than other types of soils. The hierarchical tree was constructed with Euclidean distance and Ward's criterion  (Figure-3) . The inertia gain diagram distinguishes a division into 3 classes. The Chi 2 test was significant, with a critical probability less than 0.05 (P.value = 0.02<0.05). The variable ""types of geological substratum"" is related to the class division that was constructed. In class 1, there has been no geologic substratum that is significantly over or under-represented (NULL). In class 2, the Schist geological substratum was significantly overrepresented (P. value = 0.003 and positive test value: v. Test = 2.90). The results showed that         17, 18  . The contents of carbon and organic nitrates are very variable. This variability's are explained by very different agricultural practices over the extent of the coffee production area and also the previous crop 1 . The coefficient of variation of the high C/N also indicates that decomposition processes are variable and fast overall. Similarly, highly variable levels at large scales where agronomic and pedological differences are important, as our work indicates were reported  19  . 
 Description of individuals (map units Referring to the clay and silt indices, the organic matter contents of some soils are in the standards suggested, while other grades deviate from them. On the other hand the nitrogen contents are below the recommendations for all the soils sampled, therefore considered as low. The explanation that follows is that nitrogen is hardly adsorbable on the cation exchange complex. And it also remains the only source of nutritive supply of coffee trees that have a great affinity for nitrogen since farmers bring no soil fertilizer 1 . The degree of pH dispersion around the average is relatively low. These values are close to those obtained by another author  20  . A soil pH of 5.5-6.5 is considered the most appropriate for coffee growth  18  . Soil pH averaged 5.7 ± 0.4, and thus largely within this range. On the other hand, the phosphorus contents have a greater variability; their coefficient of variation (30%) is of the same order of magnitude as those quoted by Augusto 21 . However, few soils showed levels of available phosphorus below the threshold established by references. They established at 15ppm the value below which coffee soils need phosphorus input. 
 Analysis of the spatial distribution of soil units and diagnosis of their fertility: The variability of the chemical parameters of the absorbed complex of sampled soils is due to the diversity of agropedological conditions. More specifically, for some authors, it comes from the primary alteration of minerals: biotite, muscovite, mica, orthoclase and microcline; chlorite and feldspar  22, 23  . Another author confer this on the biomass cycle, releasing cations and silica in the upper soil  24  . In our study, the average K:Ca:Mg ratio (5:65:30%) derived from the percentages of exchangeable bases, was found to be out of balance with the references. This can be attributed to the removal of minerals by coffee cultivation or caused by erosion or leaching after more than 50 years without the addition of external nutrients. It also observed soil's exchangeable bases change in South Sumatra after 20 years of coffee cultivation  25  . Although the characteristics of soil organo-mineral constituents are partly dependent on factors acting at shorter time scales (seasonal variations of climate, anthropogenic factors), for these same constituents, their vertical stratification and their lateral variations are intimately linked to pedogenesis. Therefore, the spatial variability of physico-chemical properties has been evaluated at the map units level. Analysis of the spatial distribution of map units showed two main components that explain the variability of soil characteristics. Dimension 1, which opposes soils from shale to soils derived from granites, tertiary sands and basic rocks, reflects the relative richness of soils from shale compared to other types of soils. Dimension 2 shows that the cationic exchange capacity of shale-derived soils remains relatively high compared to soils from granite. The comparison of the observations on the study area with the surveys carried out by Perraud 8 on the same study areas shows that the soils have retained their main characteristics 8 . Soils resulting from shists remain relatively well stocked in organo-mineral matter and in clay unlike soils from granites. Such a remark was reported in the Central African Republic 17 . In fact, OM and finest fractions (clays) combine and form the clay-humic complex, thus increasing the fixing capacity of the mineral elements  26, 27  . In addition, the association of fine elements-organic materials develops, by their colloidal properties, a significant load on their surface allowing the adsorption of minerals. The coffee soils with the highest organic matter content had a relatively high content of nitrogen and exchangeable bases K, Ca and Mg. Such correlations have beneficial effects on the characteristics of the adsorbent complex  28, 29  . In fact, humus derived from organic matter protects the clay, stabilizes the soil structure and promotes the maintenance of mineral elements. Organic matter thus illustrates the role of physical protection on these particle size fractions, as already pointed out by some authors, but also by chemical protectors as demonstrated by our results  30, 31  . Based on the index of the sum of clay and silt and by comparison with the appropriate levels proposed, different nutritional diagnoses of soil under coffee have been reported  17, 32, 18  . For Class 1 soils, the nitrogen content (0.23%) and the available phosphorus (11 mg.kg-1) are the most limiting compared to the proposed levels (1.85% and 12.5%, respectively). CEC, exchangeable bases and saturation are higher than optimal levels. For the Class 2 soils, except for the available potassium for which the content is high compared to the reference value (84 mg.kg -1 against 12.5 mg.kg -1 ), the other nutrients showed levels limiting for coffee tree nutrition. However, the CEC (15 cmol(+)kg -1 ) is above the reference value (10 cmol(+)kg -1 ) and the saturation level (36%) is well below the reference value (60%). For soils of class 3, except for available phosphorus (82 mg.kg -1 ) and magnesium (1.24cmol(+).kg -1 ) which have high levels compared to reference values (13mg.kg -1 for available phosphorus and 0.80cmol(+).kg -1 for magnesium). Nitrogen, potassium and calcium are the most limiting nutrients. The saturation rate (34%) is well below the reference value (60%). 
 Conclusion The present work has revealed the current physicochemical status of coffee soils. The spatial distribution of the physicochemical parameters allowed to determine a set of soil variables used as indicators of the fertility level of coffee soils. The analysis of the selected variables highlighted the grouping into three types of soils with dissimilar physicochemical profiles. In addition, soils have low nitrogen content, more than 90% of soils are desaturated and present a chemical imbalance for coffee tree nutrition. At this stage, it is essential to provide soil nutrients to support sustainable coffee production. Soils that have become poorer after several decades of cultivation should be amended to meet the nutritional requirements of coffee trees.  show the average physicochemical values of soil mapping units according to geological provenance. The CS (clay + silt) index varies according to the soil units (from 19 to 35%). The total nitrogen content(N) in all soils was less than 0.27%. Soil organic matter (OM) varied between 2.0 and 4.76% with an average of 2.87%. 
 Characterization of the fertility of soil mapping units: The first two principal components account for 85.44% of the total inertia. The percentage of information explained by each axis is 61.95% for component 1 and 23.49% for component 2 (Figure-1). The first component (Dim 1) is bonded on the positive side to high values of OM, exchangeable bases K, Ca, Mg, Total cation and bases saturation percentage (BSP). The variable ""Pav"" is related to component 1 on the negative side opposite to the first variables. The second component (Dim 2), on the upper side is linked the variable CEC and N of the soil. This component is not related to any variable on the lower side. On the correlation circle, positive correlation between soil OM, N and CEC was observed. Exchangeable bases and bases saturation percentage are positively correlated. Also, negative correlation was observed between available phosphorus and exchangeable bases while there is no correlation between available phosphorus, CEC, N and OM. 
 Figure- 2 2 shows the distribution of individuals in the factorial plane. Soils from Granite FS_SRA, Granite SF_mR FMD, Granite SF_maRT, Basic rocks FS_MA are related to the first component on the negative side and soils from Schists FS_IA on the positive side. On the second component, soils from Granite FS_MFOA, Basic rocks FS_SRT, Granite FS_IA, Granite FS_MHFA, Granite FS_Complex, Tertiary sands FS_M contribute to the formation of this factor on the negative side and on the positive side the soils from Schists FS_SRA, Schists FS_HA, Schists FS_MA and Schists FS_MHFA.It is more particularly observed that the soils from the Schists FS_IA geological formation are those which have relatively high contents of organic compounds and exchangeable bases. Soils from Granite FS_SRA, Basic rocks FS_MA, Granite SF_mR FMD, Granite SF_maRT, are the most depleted in mineral and organic elements but have high levels of available phosphorus. Soils from Schists FS_SRA, Schists FS_HA, Schist SF_mR FMD and ShistSF_mfiR FMD have a relatively high cation exchange capacity and nitrogen content. In addition, soils from Granite FS_MHFA, Granite FS_MFOA, Basic rocks FS_SRT, Granite FS_IA, Granite FS_Complex, Tertiary sands FS_M have high bases saturation percentage. 
 80% of the soils (MU) of the Schist geological substratum are in class 2. The Shale represented 100% in class 2 whereas it accounted for only 33.33% (global) of the set of measures. In class 3, the Granite geological substratum was significantly overrepresented (P. value = 0.018 and positive test value v. Test = 2.35) and the Schist geological substratum was underrepresented (P. value = 0.0003 and value negative test: v. test = -3.58). The results showed that 100% of the soils (MU) of the Granite geological substratum are in class 3. Granite represents 70% of class 3 whereas it represents only 46.66% (overall) of all measures. No soil (MU) of the Schist geological substratum is represented in class 3. It should be noted that no basic Roche or Tertiary sand geologic substratum is significantly over or underrepresented in any class. 
 ): For each class, 5 individuals closest to the class if possible were ranked according to their proximity to the center of the class. The analysis of the individual closest to the class makes it possible to characterize on average this class according to the values of the physicochemical parameters. For class 1, this type of soil (MU) is derived from Schist FS_IA. Soils of this class are particularly dominated by relatively high saturation, high exchangeable base (K, Ca and Mg) and organic matter relative to average values of other soil types. On the other hand, the values of assimilable potassium content are low.Class 2 includes four types of soils based on shale. These are the soils from Schist FS_MA, Schists FS_HA, Schist SF_mfiR FMD and SchistSF_Fraj FMD. Since the Schist FS_MA is the paragon of this, the general characteristics of this class reflect the physicochemical characteristics of this type of soil. Excluding the CEC for which the value is high compared to the general average, soils of this class have average values in exchangeable bases K, Ca and Mg relatively low. The contents of N and the saturation rate also remain low.Class 3 brings together basic soils, tertiary soils and granite soils. Granite SF_maRT being the paragon of this, the general characteristics of this class reflect the physicochemical characteristics of this type of soil. The soils have an Mg, CS content, CEC, organic matter and N values below the overall average.

Characterization class by class: A test based on analysis of 
variance indicates the quantitative variables that differ 
significantly between the three classes (Table-3). The parameter 
Eta2 is the measure of the magnitude of the correlation ratio 
between a quantitative variable and the class variable 
(qualitative variable). It highlights all the quantitative variables 
(physicochemical parameters) that differ significantly between 
classes (P-value <5%). Only the critical probabilities associated 
with the additional variables (CS and TC) have been interpreted. 
Base saturation was strongly related to the geological 

substratum. For each class, the characteristic variables either by 
their especially high average (positive test value) or by their 
especially low average (negative test value) were evaluated. 
Thus, for class 1, the physicochemical parameters K, TC, BSP, 
Ca, Mg and OM each have a |test value| ≥2 and a mean that is 
particularly high that the overall average, whereas the Pav has 
an average particularly weak (P. value<5%) but a |Test-value| 
≥2. For class 2, the physicochemical parameters CEC and N 
have a positive test value (respectively v. CEC test = 3.19 and v. 
Test N = 2.11). The class average is statistically higher than the

general average (P.value=<5%). For class 3 all the 
physicochemical parameters (Ca, TC, Mg, CS, N, OM and 
CEC) have a negative test value. The average physicochemical 
values of the class are statistically lower than the general 
average (P.value<5%).

Moreover, over recent decades mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, all caused by Aedes species, have emerged or re-emerged in many regions  [2] [3] [4] . As vaccines do not exist for most mosquito-borne diseases, vector control is essential to prevent outbreaks. A capacity to predict the locations and dynamics of mosquito populations at a local scale would help vector control agencies target their interventions. Modelling approaches are powerful tools for identifying and prioritizing where and when surveillance and control should be targeted. Two main approaches are used to understand and predict mosquito population dynamics: i) process-based (or mechanistic) models describing biological knowledge within a mathematical or computational framework, and ii) empirical (or statistical) models, which try to find, from the observed data, a predictive function of the response variable (mosquito populations) based on a set of predictors within a statistical or a machine learning framework. Both approaches have been successfully applied to different mosquito species and geographical contexts  [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , resulting in a better understanding of their distribution  [5-8, 11, 12, 16]  and dynamics  [9, 10, 13, 17, 18]  and the assessment of different mosquito control strategies  [19, 20] . However, most case studies only develop one of the two approaches (either empirical  [5-8, 11, 12, 14, 16]  or process-based  [9, 10, 13, 15, 17]  depending on the availability of data and knowledge), and do not compare the capacity of the two approaches to predict mosquito population dynamics. Moreover, although many models have been developed, including spatially explicit simulation models (e.g., 'Skeeter buster' software for Aedes aegypti  [15] ), there is a lack of operational tools that can be used by public health authorities and vector control services. In Reunion island, a French overseas department located in the Indian Ocean, Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) caused two major arbovirus outbreaks in 1977 (dengue) and in  2005-2006 (chikungunya)    [3, 21] . In 2004, a second dengue outbreak of lower intensity was reported, followed by an interepidemic period with sporadic cases and clusters  [22] . Recently, a recrudescence of dengue occurred, with 7596 new autochthonous dengue cases reported between 2017 and February 2019  [23] . This epidemic situation heightened the needs of the vector control service of the Regional Health Agency (local representation of the French Ministry of Health) for predictive spatial models of Ae. albopictus population dynamics. Indeed, very high spatial and temporal heterogeneities of Ae. albopictus density have been reported  [24] . Different modelling studies of Ae. albopictus distribution and dynamics have been developed in recent years. Distribution maps have been derived from environmental and meteorological datasets using empirical models, at worldwide  [7] , regional  [8] , national  [11, 12]  and local scales  [6, 16] . In Reunion Island, theoretical process-based population dynamics models have been used to assess control strategies  [20, 25] , taking into account mosquito dispersal  [26, 27]  and the impact of human behavior  [28] . Nevertheless, none of these precedent research efforts have addressed both space and time dynamics of Ae. albopictus to produce mosquito density maps that can be used by the public health authority to target vector surveillance and control actions. Our objective was twofold. First, we developed and compared two types of models of Ae. albopictus species population dynamics in Reunion Island: an empirical model that predicts mosquito population dynamics from a set of weather variables using a Support Vector Machine (SVM)  [29] , and a process-based model derived from  (Cailly et al., 2012; Tran et al., 2013)    [17, 19] . The comparison was performed by confronting the predictions of the two models against field entomological data. Second, from the results of the two modelling approaches, we developed, in close collaboration with the vector control service of the Regional Health Agency (https://www.ocean-indien.ars.sante.fr/), an operational tool that produces maps of predicted Ae. albopictus abundances from daily rainfall and temperature data collected from the National Weather Service (https://donneespubliques.meteofrance.fr/). Suzanne, Possession, St-Paul)  (Fig 1, Table 1 ). The municipalities issued the permission to the regional Health Agency, representative of the French Ministry of Health, to conduct the field studies in the framework of its public health mission. In each site, six traps (small containers of 100 cl) were deployed in the vicinity of a national weather station. We considered that each study site covered a 300 m-radius area around the corresponding weather station (28.3 ha), a distance corresponding to the active dispersal flight of Ae. albopictus  [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . The traps were placed empty at the beginning of the trapping campaign, and then were naturally filled by rainfall. Each week, the number of larvae (L3-L4 stages) and pupae were recorded in the field (S1  Table) . After being counted, the larvae and pupae were removed from the traps. In addition, egg collections were used for the validation of the process-based model (S1 File). 
 Meteorological data The meteorological service 'Meteo France' (https://publitheque.meteo.fr) provided the daily temperature (minimum and maximum) and rainfall records from 2011 to 2014 at 32 weather stations, including the five weather stations where entomological data were collected  (Fig 1) . Indeed, although entomological data were collected between 2012 and 2014 (see above and S1 File), the acquisition of meteorological data covering the year before the period of interest was necessary for both models. The data was used for the calculation of climatic variables to be tested in the empirical approach, and for the initialization of the process-based model. 
 Empirical approach For all sites and all dates of entomological collections, the mean number of larvae (at the L3 and L4 stages) per trap was calculated. The purpose of the model was to predict these observations according to weather conditions. The weather conditions were featured by a combination of at most three input variables in order to avoid overfitting problems. The three input variables were drawn from a set of 531 climate indices based on minimum temperature, maximum temperature and rainfall, identified in the literature as potentially influencing Ae. albopictus abundance. These indices are: • minimum temperature (last N days) • maximum temperature (last N days) • rain accumulation (last N days) • maximum rainfall (last N days) • maximum number of consecutive days without rain (last N days) • number of days when variable X is greater or less than S X (last N days) • maximum number of consecutive days when variable X is greater or less than S X (last N days) The model with the best performance was identified using a selection criterion based on the mean square error associated with a k-fold cross validation technique with k = 5. A Support Vector Machine (SVM)  [36]  is a supervised learning technique that analyses data and identifies patterns used for classification or regression. SVM maps input vectors (here the weather variables) to a higher dimension feature space using kernel functions in order to find maximum separating hyperplanes. Here we used the SVM version called Support Vector Regression (SVR) able to perform regression with continuous variables (here the mean number of larvae per trap). The SVR method was used to perform the non-linear regression with a radial kernel, a cost coefficient set to 1 and the epsilon parameter set to 1. All of the statistical calculations were performed in R language  [37]  using the package ""e1071""  [29] . For some input variables such as the ones related to rain accumulation, a logarithm was applied to obtain a Gaussianlike distribution which gave better results in terms of mean square error. 
 Process-based approach We used the generic mechanistic framework proposed by Cailly et al.  [10, 19]  for modelling mosquito populations that was adapted to Ae. albopictus in southern France  [17] . We followed the recommendations of  (Ezanno et al., 2015)  [10] to adapt the generic population dynamics model in a new geographic area. The model is based on a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) and represents all steps of the mosquito life cycle, considering both aquatic stages (E, eggs; L, larvae; P, pupae) and adult stages (A em , emerging adult females; A 1 , nulliparous females; A 2 , parous females). In addition, parous and nulliparous females are subdivided in compartments regarding their behaviour (h, host-seeking; g: transition from engorged to gravid; o, oviposition site seeking)  (Fig 2) . The mosquito life cycle used in  [17]  was modified because the tropical strains of Ae. albopictus that are present in Reunion Island do not enter diapause and are active throughout the year  [38] . Thus, the ODE system is: _ E ¼ g Ao ðb 1 A 1o þ b 2 A 2o Þ À ðm E þ f E ÞE _ L ¼ f E E À ðm L ð1 þ L=k L Þ þ f L ÞL _ P ¼ f L L À ðm P þ f P ÞP _ A em ¼ f P Pse ðÀ m em ð1þP=k P ÞÞ À ðm A þ g Aem ÞA em _ A 1h ¼ g Aem A em À ðm A þ m r þ g Ah ÞA 1h _ A 1g ¼ g Ah A 1h À ðm A þ f Ag ÞA 1g _ A 1o ¼ f Ag A 1g À ðm A þ m r þ f Ao ÞA 1o _ A 2h ¼ f Ao ðA 1o þ A 2o Þ À ðm A þ m r þ g Ah ÞA 2h _ A 2g ¼ g Ah A 2h À ðm A þ f Ag ÞA 2g _ A 2o ¼ f Ag A 2g À ðm A þ m r þ g Ao ÞA 2o ð1Þ 8 > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > < > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > : Parameters and functions were adapted from  [17]  given the results of experimental  [39]  and observational  [24, 40]  studies on local Ae. albopictus populations in Reunion. Parameters (Greek letters in Eq 1) are constant: for stage X, γ X is the transition rate to the next compartment, μ X the mortality rate, β X the egg laying rate and σ the sex-ratio at the emergence; μ r is an additional adult mortality rate related to seeking behaviour (  Table 2 ). According to the sensitivity analysis of the model (see  [17]  for details), the standard environment carrying capacity, the mortality rate at emergence, and the sex-ratio, are the most influential parameters on the variations in the peak of adult abundance, and need to be estimated as precisely as possible. Functions (Latin letters in Eq 1) are weather-driven functions, varying over time: for stage X, f X is the transition rate to the next stage, m X the mortality rate, k X the environment carrying capacity. Consistent with the empirical approach, we considered temperature (T) and  σ Sex-ratio at emergence 0.5  [39]  γ Aem Development rate of emerging adults (day −1 ) 0.4  [17]  γ Ah Transition rate from host-seeking to engorged adults (day −1 ) 0.2  [17]  γ Ao Minimum transition rate from ovipositing to host-seeking adults (day −1 ) 0.2  [17]  μ E Minimum egg mortality rate (day −1 ) 0.05  [17]  μ em Mortality rate during emergence (day −1 ) 0.1  [17]  μ r Mortality rate related to seeking behaviour (day −1 ) 0.08  [17]  T precipitation (P) as the two forcing function variables  (Table 3) . Daily precipitation and daily mean temperature were used. Temperatures affect the development of aquatic stages, egg maturation, and the mortality rates of larvae, pupae and adults  [39] . Heavy rains have an impact on the mortality rates of aquatic stages by flushing the breeding habitats  [41] . Rainfall also has an impact on the availability of breeding sites in the environment, and thus the transition rate from ovipositing to host-seeking female adults  [17, 42] . In Reunion Island, Ae. albopictus can be found in urban, suburban and natural areas up to an altitude of 1,200 meters  [40] . Females lay eggs in either natural (e.g., tree holes, bamboo stumps) or artificial (e.g., water containers, flower plates or vases, basins and reservoirs, tires) oviposition sites  [24] . Thus, the environment carrying capacity of aquatic stages (k L , k P ) that reflects the availability of oviposition sites in a given place is partially driven by precipitation: due to artificial flooding (e.g., watering of gardens), human-made oviposition sites such as flower plates or vases provide a standard environment carrying capacity for larvae or pupae (κ Xfix ) that remains constant over time, whereas the availability of the other types of oviposition sites is driven by rainfall (Eq 2): k X ðtÞ ¼ k Xfix þ k Xvar � P norm ðtÞ; X in fL; Pg ð2Þ The standard fixed (κ Xfix ) and variable (κ Xvar ) environment carrying capacities, which are key parameters of the model, were estimated for each Regional Health Agency operational zone from field observations that are routinely collected by the vector control service (see S2 File for details). P norm (t) is defined as the rainfall amount summed over a one week period, and normalized in order to vary between 0 and 1  [17] . 
 Evaluation of the models The two models were evaluated by comparing the predicted abundance of larvae with the abundance observed through entomological data collections in the five study sites. For each  Table 3 . Process-based approach: model functions.

For the process-based model, we compared relative abundances (i.e., the predicted larvae density against the observed number of larvae per trap). Indeed, absolute quantitative information on larvae abundance in the field is not available.

 Development of the 'ALBORUN' tool Spatial dynamic models of Ae. albopictus populations were built within the 'Ocelet' language and simulation environment (www.ocelet.org). This programming language is dedicated to the modelling of spatially explicit systems and their dynamics and facilitates the handling of spatial information using interaction graphs  [43] . In the 'ALBORUN' model, the main elements of the models ('entities') are i) the 1,203 operational zones defined by the vector control service (polygon geometry), characterized by their respective values of standard fixed (κ Xfix ) and variable (κ Xvar ) environment carrying capacities, and ii) the 32 weather stations (point geometry) whose daily rainfall and temperature are imported as text file (csv format). Operational zone entities interact with the weather stations through a 'relation': the temperature and rainfall of each operational zone is defined as those of the closest weather station. In the 'scenario', the sequence of operations and interactions between operational zones and weather stations are defined as follows: i) the daily rainfall, and the minimum and maximum temperature values are read from the weather stations and attributed to the related operational zones; ii) for each operational zone, the model functions  (Table 3 ) are updated; iii) the process-based Ae. albopictus population dynamics are computed (Eq 1) using the implicit Euler method to solve the ODE; iv) the significant variables identified by the empirical approach are updated; and v) the empirical approach-based predicted Ae. albopictus population dynamics are computed. The computation of predicted Ae. albopictus densities through the different approaches enables the user to compare the two models' outputs for the larval stage. The Ocelet source code is available on Github (https://github.com/OceletTeam/ocelet) and the 'ALBORUN' files are available in a dataverse repository (doi:10.18167/DVN1/XF2I3L). To provide an operational tool for the staff of the vector control service of the Regional Health Agency, a user-friendly interface was developed using Xthe JavaFx library (https://docs. oracle.com/javafx). The Ocelet simulation environment automatically translates the model written in Ocelet language into a program written in Java programming language (www.java. com). That program is saved in the form of a java archive (jar) file which can be embedded into the JavaFx based user interface. 
 Results 
 Empirical model The model with the best performance (S2  Table)  included a set of two variables: the cumulative rainfall over the last 35 days and the average of minimum temperature over the last 42 days  (Fig 3) . The relationships between the juvenile population of Ae. albopictus, temperature and precipitation are clearly non-linear and the variations of mosquito abundances are very sensitive to those of temperature and precipitation. The favourable conditions are between 90 and 800 mm of rain accumulation over the last 35 days and an average of minimum temperature above 21˚C over the last 42 days. Beyond 90 mm or over 800 mm of rainfall accumulation during the last 35 days, the number of L3 and L4 stage larvae decreases. The model fits seasonal variations in mosquito abundance, with a peak in March-April in late southern summer  (Fig 4) . 
 Process-based model Driven by daily rainfall and temperature data, the process-based model predicted the abundance of Ae. albopictus per stage (eggs, larvae, pupae, and nulliparous and parous female adult stages) over time. Different temperature and rainfall profiles resulted in variations of the mosquito population dynamics. The model predicted adequately the seasonal and interannual variations in the abundance of the aquatic stages, with a peak occurring in March, at the end of the austral summer, except for the St-Benoit site  (Fig 4) . Differences between sites were due to differences of rainfall profiles between the eastern and western sites, with heavier and regular rain  events in the east. The maximum larvae densities were predicted for the northern site (Ste-Marie)  (Fig 4) . 
 Evaluation of the models The predictions of both the empirical and process-based approaches were consistent with the observed Ae. albopictus larvae abundance in the five collection sites  (Fig 4) . The predicted and observed abundances were highly correlated in the sites with higher larval densities and marked seasonal variations (St-Paul, Possession, Ste-Marie) (  Table 4 ). In the eastern site (St-Benoit), where the observed Ae. albopictus abundances are low (<20 larvae/trap) with few seasonal variations, the correlation coefficients were lower and not significant. The predictions of the process-based model for egg dynamics were significantly correlated with observed egg abundances (see S3 File). The prediction accuracy of the empirical model deteriorated slightly when the 5 fold method is used or when the calibration is performed over the full dataset leaving out the data from the site in question. These results validated the robustness of the model when used on areas not included in the model calibration even if, as expected, the forecasts can be slightly less accurate in this case. The comparison of the models' predictions for 32 weather stations showed that the two models strongly agree for the areas with the highest mean annual temperatures (>22˚C), corresponding to the western, northern and southern coastal areas, and can be in disagreement for the areas with low mean annual temperature (<19˚C) or high annual rainfall (>4000 mm), corresponding to high elevation areas and the eastern coast (S2 and S3 Figs). 
 'ALBORUN' simulation tool With a user-friendly interface ('ALBORUN' tool, see S4 File), the simulation model displays several input parameters that are used to control the simulations from the user interface. The users' choices include the time interval and the geographical area (operational sectors) to run the simulations, as well as the input folders (the folders where input data are stored as shapefiles for weather stations and operational zones, and csv text files for daily weather data), and the output folder (the folder where outputs are saved as a shapefile for visualization with a Geographic Information System and a log file). 
 Spatial model outputs Using daily precipitation and temperature data collected from a network of weather stations and the 'ALBORUN' tool, empirical and process-based models are used to simulate the spatial dynamics of Ae. albopictus population over Reunion Island, at a spatial scale adapted to vector control interventions  (Fig 5) . For each operational zone defined by the vector control services, the 'ALBORUN' tool predicts the abundances of Ae. albopictus mosquitoes per stage at a weekly frequency (this frequency was defined in consultation with the vector control service). The resulting maps highlight the high spatial and temporal heterogeneity of Ae. albopictus populations on Reunion Island (see example for year 2013 in  Fig 5) . Higher densities of Ae. albopictus are predicted during the austral summer, with a peak in March, when the species is present in high abundances in all coastal regions. 'ALBORUN' outputs (Ae. albopictus predicted abundances) in shapefile format can be integrated in a GIS environment with other geographical information (e.g. epidemiological data, administrative limits, records of previous vector-control operations, etc.) and used by public health stakeholders for visualization and analysis at different spatial scales (e.g. operational sector, municipality, or region). 
 Discussion The surveillance and control of mosquito-borne diseases is of prime public health importance in tropical areas. In Reunion Island, following the major chikungunya outbreak in 2005-2006 that had important health and economic impacts  [44] , and the recent dengue recrudescence  [45, 46] , there is an urgent need for operational mapping tools to optimize the actions of the vector control services. Our results demonstrate that modelling approaches may provide  
 Environmental drivers of Ae. albopictus populations Using only two input variables, rainfall and temperature, both the empirical and process-based modelling approaches successfully predicted Ae. albopictus in five contrasting locations of Reunion Island  (Fig 4) . These two variables have been identified as the main drivers of Ae. albopictus species in different geographic contexts  [47] [48] [49] . According to the results of the empirical approach  (Fig 3) , higher temperatures favour larvae abundance. Indeed, temperature positively affects the development and survival of all aquatic stages up to 35˚C  [49] . This threshold value corresponds to the maximum temperature observed in Reunion Island  (Fig 4) , explaining the positive correlations between temperature and abundance of Ae. albopictus larvae in our study area. Our results also showed that precipitation impacts the abundance of Ae. albopictus mosquitoes in Reunion Island. The effects can be positive (rainfall favouring the creation of oviposition sites) or negative (heavy rainfall limiting the abundance of aquatic stages when cumulative rainfall over the preceding 35-day period is high)  (Fig 3) . This suggests that in Reunion Island, oviposition sites are mostly rainfall-dependent. This is in contrast with the situation in other areas, where Ae. albopictus females mainly breed in water containers that are independent of rainfall, for example those filled through the watering of plants in gardens  [17, 48] . This result is consistent with the conclusions of observational studies conducted in different urban landscapes of Reunion Island, showing that oviposition sites can be either natural (e. g., tree holes) or artificial (e.g., water containers, flower plates or vases)  [24] . The negative effect of rainfall on Ae. albopictus densities can be explained by the flushing of immature stages (eggs, larvae, pupae) from the rainfall-dependent oviposition sites under heavy precipitation  [41] . Other climatic variables, such as relative humidity, were not included in our study although the impact of relative humidity on egg and adult stages has been reported  [49] . In our study area, rainfall and temperature seem sufficient to explain most of the observed intraannual variability in mosquito abundance, particularly because the relative humidity in Reunion Island's tropical climate remains favourable to adult survival throughout the year. However, this variable may be of importance in other contexts. 
 Contribution of the empirical modelling approach A large set of explicative variables (531 variables) were tested in the exploratory empirical approach. Our results highlighted the importance of precipitation and temperature on the dynamics of Ae. albopictus larval stages in Reunion Island. They showed that the observed larvae abundance can be explained from the cumulative values of these two key variables over a time period of 5 to 8 weeks before the sampling with little differences between the first ten models in terms of performance (S2  Table) . This time period is probably related to the reproductive biological life cycle of Ae. albopictus, as temperature impacts the development of immature stages  [39] , and rainfall has an effect on the availability of some of the oviposition sites. Our results, although based on the collection of immature stages collections alone, are consistent with other studies demonstrating the effect of cumulative temperature on host-seeking Ae. albopictus females  [48] . Overall, the interpretation of the results of the empirical modelling approach helped to identify the mechanisms (i.e., the impact of rainfall on the oviposition sites) to be included in the process-based approach. The relationship between larval abundance and weather variables was found to be clearly non-linear  (Fig 3) . While the model predicts little or no abundance when mean temperatures and cumulative rainfall are low (respectively below 21˚C and below 90 mm), the number of larvae can be observed when mean temperatures are low (< 21˚C) and rainfall is heavy (last 35 days cumulative > 550 mm). The mean number of larval stages L3 and L4 per trap may exceed 40 when the average of minimum temperature over the last 42 days is above 22˚C and the cumulative rainfall over the last 35 days is between 90 mm and 800 mm. Interestingly, even when the temperature conditions are a priori favourable (average above 22˚C), if the cumulative rainfall is above 800 mm during the last 35 days, the predicted number of larvae does not exceed 20. The latter result may be linked to the flooding of oviposition sites, which may have a negative impact on the population dynamics of Ae. albopictus  [41, 50] . This non-linear relationship cannot be handled by standard linear models and the SVM approach (among other empirical approaches that can handle non-linearity, such as generalized additive models) was particularly important in this context. Another interesting feature is that the best model calibrated with data from all sites displayed results comparable to models calibrated site by site (less than 3% of mean square error loss). 
 Contribution of the process-based modelling approach In this second approach, the biological processes underlying Ae. albopictus populations were described using a weather-driven mosquito population dynamics model  [17]  that was adapted to tropical Ae. albopictus populations present in Reunion Island. The impacts of rainfall and temperature on the development and mortality rates of aquatic and aerial stages were thus explicitly modelled based on a bibliographic review of observational and experimental studies. In this exercise, the results from the empirical approach were used in the identification of the main drivers of the population dynamics and the modelling choices. As outputs, the processbased model predicted the abundances of all the different stages. This allowed the validation of the model using entomological field data on larvae abundance  (Fig 4) , but also on egg collections (see S3 File), and predictions of the adult stages as an entomological risk index  (Fig 5) . In addition, such an approach, one that explicitly included the availability of oviposition sites for each operational zone used by the vector control service, rendered it possible to predict the mosquito abundances at an adequate spatial resolution for surveillance and control. Indeed, the model predictions are made for each operational zone defined by the vector control service to plan interventions. 
 Complementarity of the two approaches As far as we know, this is the first study implementing both empirical and process-based approaches to model mosquito population dynamics, although the relative advantages of both approaches have been well acknowledged in ecology  [51, 52] . Previous studies have compared the respective potential of the two approaches to map the ecological niches of Aedes albopictus  [53]  and of pathogens it can transmit, such as Zika virus  [54] . They highlight striking correspondence between the two approaches for modelling species distribution  [52, 53] , but discrepancies regarding forecasts under different climate change projections  [53]  or when coupling vector distribution with epidemiological dynamics  [54] . Based on correlative relationships, empirical models are simpler, with the mechanisms implicit, but require data for the construction and the validation of the model. It should be noted that the range of values of the data used to build the model define the limits of model application. In our study, the five study sites used to build the empirical model are all located in coastal areas  (Fig 1) , thus the predictions of the empirical model in the mountainous interior of the island should be taken with caution. Moreover, the biological explanations of the empirical relationships may not be obvious, in the case of non-linear relationships and cumulative effects. Process-based models, on the other hand, are based on causal relationships, do not require data for their construction, and are more comprehensive because they explicitly incorporate mechanisms. Moreover, such models can be used to test in silico different scenarios, in particular, control strategies for aquatic and adult stages  [19] . However, they require an important amount of knowledge of the biological processes involved that may not be available for species other than Ae. albopictus, for which numerous studies have been published in recent years. In our study, although enough knowledge on Ae. albopictus was available to build a process-based model, the conclusions of the empirical approach were useful as they allowed us to identify the main drivers of the population dynamics that were included in the process-based model. As all empirical models with the best performances included a set of variables related to rainfall and temperature (S2  Table) , the two variables were identified as important. This result demonstrated that temperature remains an important driver of Ae. albopictus population dynamics in a tropical environment, although the annual temperature variations are less important than in a temperate climate. Thus, regarding this aspect the process-based model developed in Southern France  [17]  could not be simplified. Moreover, the empirical approach highlighted the negative effects of rainfall; this effect was explicitly taken into account in the process-based model, with the definition of rainfall-dependent mortality functions for aquatic stages. The comparison between modelled and observed abundances  (Fig 4)  showed that the two approaches can be successfully used to predict Ae. albopictus abundances over time from precipitation and temperature data. The comparison between the predictions of the two approaches demonstrated that the models are in strong agreement for climatic conditions similar to those of the study sites where entomological data were available to build the empirical model (S2  Fig).  These conditions correspond to the coastal, more densely populated areas, where a good knowledge of the population dynamics of Ae. albopictus is needed for the organization of vector control measures by public health authorities. In these areas, the strong agreement of the two models strengthens the confidence in models' predictions (S3  Fig).  In other areas, the process-based approach should be preferred, as it is more reliable than the empirical approach to predict mosquito population dynamics in areas where the meteorological conditions differ from the observed dataset. 
 Transfer of research results to stakeholders and decision-makers The 'ALBORUN' tool developed in this study was successfully transferred to the vector control service of the Regional Health Agency as a mapping tool for the surveillance and control of vector populations. To the best of our knowledge, this tool is the first population dynamics model for Ae. albopictus populations in a tropical environment that simulates in time and space mosquito densities using daily meteorological data and environmental characteristics. It allows one to compare different areas and/or periods of time, and helps decision-makers target areas for surveillance and control. Whereas all recent modelling studies of Ae. albopictus distribution  [6-8, 11, 12, 16]  use environmental data such as the land cover or satellite-derived indices as proxies of the suitable areas for Ae. albopictus, the 'ALBORUN' tool relies on field data on the number of potential oviposition sites. From this large and exhaustive dataset (all operational zones are monitored by the Regional Health Agency services), the inputs of the 'ALBORUN' tool are as close to reality as possible, and indeed the model outputs reflect the high spatial heterogeneity of Ae. albopictus populations that is observed on Reunion Island  [24] . 
 Limitations and perspectives The empirical model with a set of two variables (cumulative rainfall over the last 35 days and the average of minimum temperature over the last 42 days) provided the best results in terms of Mean Square Error between observations and model outputs (S2  Table) , using a 5-fold cross validation method by randomly assigning the data. Nevertheless, in the case of temporal data with temporal autocorrelation, assigning data non randomly in the cross-calibration process could be beneficial as soon as more data become available to avoid any risk of overfitting  [55] . The main limitation of the process-based model is the uncertainty on the parameters and functions values  (Tables 2 and 3 ). As they could not all be derived from studies on Ae. albopictus species in Reunion, we also had to turn to studies conducted in other geographical contexts. According to our expertise, the values are realistic for Reunion, but additional local experimental studies may improve the parameter and function estimates, and consequently the model outputs. In addition, it should be noted that the evaluation of the models was based on one-year entomological field data for four out of the five study sites. New entomological collections in varied eco-climatic zones of Reunion Island would be needed to assess the validity of the 'ALBORUN' tool at a regional scale. In particular, standard mark-release-recapture experiments  [56]  would allow one to evaluate the capacity of the process-based model to predict the absolute values of mosquito densities. Moreover, such experiments would allow evaluating the impact of mosquito dispersal on the population dynamics. In this study, this impact was neglected, assuming the inflows/outflows of mosquitoes negligible compared to the population of a zone, as  Lacroix et al. (2009)  demonstrated that in Reunion Island Ae. albopictus has a short dispersal range (less than 50 m), and as the operational zones were defined by delineating isolated areas, or areas separated by barriers for mosquito dispersal such as roads and open fields  [31]  (S1  Fig).  Yet, such assumption would need to be verified from field observations. Finally, in our study we compared two modelling approaches with the only and limited example of Ae. albopictus in Reunion Island. Assessing the respective performances of the two approaches for other geographical contexts and/or species would allow a broader and less specific comparison. Due to the particular relief and climate of Reunion Island, rainfall and temperature data can vary greatly over short distances. Finer estimates of local rainfall and temperature (e.g. gridded rainfall and temperature data) would improve the model predictions. Other potential improvements of the tool include the possibility to integrate and test control actions  [19] , either standard operations such as the mechanical destruction of oviposition sites or insecticide spraying, or techniques that could be developed in future years such as the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) or autodissemination  [25, 57] . This would make it possible to test the effects of different control strategies in a realistic environment, with operational recommendations for the implementation of integrated control. Such improvements imply transforming the process-based model into a stochastic model in order to simulate possible population extinction, and accounting for mosquito dispersal between neighbouring zones  [26] . Moreover, the model of mosquito population dynamics could be combined with an epidemiological model of transmission to predict the areas at risk of transmission for different pathogens, such as dengue, chikungunya, or Zika viruses. Another perspective would be to apply the 'ALBORUN' model in other tropical areas and test its genericity. Due to the way it was constructed, the process-based model of Ae. albopictus developed for Reunion Island can be used in other areas, with a geographic breakdown adapted to the needs of health and vector control policy makers. However, its application may be limited by the availability of environmental input data. Indeed, in Reunion the network of weather stations is very dense  (Fig 1) , and accurate data on the spatial distribution of oviposition sites are collected on a regular basis by the vector control service of the Regional Health Agency. In data-scarce contexts, satellite remote sensing techniques can provide alternative sources of such environmental data, either from high or very high spatial resolution imagery to assess the availability of oviposition sites  [58] , or imagery with a frequent revisit period to derive rainfall or temperature proxies  [59] . The implementation of remote sensing-based population dynamics models would represent a significant advance in the development and dissemination of operational tools for real-time monitoring of vector-borne diseases.

In fruit trees, breeding programs did not account for these elementary traits and rather focused on disease resistance, fruit organoleptic properties, and yield 2 . Moreover, in the current climatic context characterized by an increase in temperature and a risk of water scarcity, targeting new varieties with high performance even under constraining conditions becomes crucial for breeding programs. Potted experiments in phenotyping platforms have arisen as performing approaches to phenotype perennial species  3  . These platforms have led to encouraging results in young potted trees through the identification of large genotypic variability in architectural (plant height, total leaf area) and functional (transpiration, water-use efficiency) traits  4  . These studies were made possible by using new technologies provided in those platforms  5  , i.e., Red Green Blue (RGB) images for plant growth estimation, and automated plant transpiration measurements. Nevertheless, such technologies are not available in field conditions and new developments are necessary to enable the phenotyping of both architectural and functional traits of woody crops at different developmental stages, including adult and fruiting. Plant architecture determines many traits associated with plant performance such as flowering intensity and intra-tree location, or light interception efficiency. Most of the studies that have dealt with genetic variations of architectural traits have focused on simple plant traits, such as height or trunk diameter  6  , whose measurements are feasible on large populations. More local traits, such as maximal internode length along trees, branching density or mean axis length were also considered on young trees  7  . These studies have shown that architectural traits are genetically controlled, and identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with their variations although these traits display high polygenetic determinisms. Nevertheless, other properties of tree canopies such as the efficiency of architectures for intercepting solar radiation or for optimizing intra-canopy microclimate (temperature, humidity) could be relevant for describing betweentrees variability. High-throughput (HT) estimations of traits such as the silhouette to total leaf area ratio (STAR  8 )  or the leaf density within the tree canopy could help characterizing genotype efficiencies. Methods based on three-dimensional (3D) digitizing were successfully used for characterizing whole tree architecture 8 but they remain time-consuming and not compatible with HT phenotyping. Terrestrial LiDAR (T-LiDAR) scanners have recently emerged as promising tools for measuring 3D vegetation structures. T-LiDAR scans have been used in many studies, mainly in forest but also in agronomic contexts  9  , notably for evaluating individual crown structure 10 or leaf area density  11  . More recently, a study reported alpha hull volume estimation based on merging RGB images of tree orchards for assessing tree space occupation  12  . However, to the best of our knowledge, T-LiDAR has never been deployed in a context of HT phenotyping for genetic studies. Measurements of carbon and water-related processes in plants are frequently carried out with InfraRed Gas-Analyzers (IRGAs). These devices allow precise assessment of leaf functions, but are time-consuming. Other variables, associated with chlorophyll fluorescence have been proposed to quickly estimate leaf photosynthesis through direct measurements on leaves or by chlorophyll fluorescence emission imaging  13  . The most used variables were the effective quantum efficiency of photosystem II (PSII), the derived electron transport rate and the photochemical and non-photochemical quenching coefficients  13, 14  . These parameters have been used in genetic studies in which associated QTLs have been detected  15  . Nevertheless, variation in the relationship between these variables and photosynthetic rate has been observed, mainly under water stress due to complex regulation of stomatal closure and subsequent repercussions on leaf fluorescence 16 . Losciale et al.  17  . recently proposed a fast method combining measurements, without dark adaptation, of chlorophyll fluorescence, carboxylative activity of the RuBisCo and temperature-based variables. The authors have shown that a resulting variable, the I PL index, was strongly and linearly correlated to net photosynthesis in apple and pear under contrasted soil water supply. The I PL thus appears as a promising indicator, but has never been tested at HT. Remotely sensed imagery in field crops have received large interest for rapid estimation of yield or responses to soil water deficit  18  . Recently, both multispectral (MS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imaging have been used for phenotyping large populations of individuals in annual species and performing genetic analyses on the estimated traits  19, 20  . However, the related developments have mainly been tackled toward homogeneous plant cover and are not fully adapted to non-fully covering crops, like orchards. Analytical adaptations were developed in apple tree to estimate water stress indicators at the tree scale within biparental populations 21 , on which genetics analyses 22 were performed. In these studies, the impact of water stress was computed based on the water deficit index (WDI) for partially soil covering vegetation. Although promising, these studies did not estimate other indicators provided by MS imaging. Among others, NDVI 23  (Table 1)  is considered as a proxy for leaf area index, and intercepted solar radiation; GNDVI 24 and MCARI2 25 are quite similar to NDVI but display more (GNDVI) or less (MCARI2) sensitivity to chlorophyll concentration; while PRI 26 accounts for the state of PSII and is considered as a proxy for radiation-use efficiency. In this article, we describe for the first time in a woody plant in an orchard, the deployment of in field multi-scale and multi-objectives HT measurements on a corecollection of 241 genotypes representative of the European diversity of apple tree  27  . Fluorescence, airborne imagery and T-LiDAR techniques were deployed on the whole core-collection, and complemented by fine, in planta characterization (stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, leaf area) on a subset of contrasted genotypes. Effects of the genotype and watering scenario were dissected and a wide genotypic variability was identified for all traits. A clustering method was then used for determining genotype classes based on combinations of architectural and functional traits. 
 Material and methods 
 Plant material and experimental set-up This study was carried out on an apple tree corecollection 27 previously characterized for architectural and functional traits at 1-year-old stage into a HT phenotyping platform in controlled conditions  4  . The 241 genotypes of the core-collection were re-multiplied at INRA Angers and grafted onto M9 Pajam® 2 rootstock before being planted in field in February 2014 at the INRA experimental unit 'DiaScope'' in Montpellier, France (43°36 N, 03°58E). Trees were planted at 5 × 2 m distances, irrigated using micro-sprayers located between-trees, and left unpruned. Trees were not thinned from planting until 2016. In 2017, trees were manually thinned in mid-June to maintain one fruit per inflorescence. The orchard (1.2 ha) comprised ten rows of 100 trees, embedding two replications of two trees per genotype randomly distributed within the field. Well-watered (WW) and water deficit (WD) tree rows alternated within the trial, one WW tree facing one WD for each genotype. During the two first years after planting, no limiting watering regime was implemented to ensure a proper development of all trees. Differential watering scenarios were set-up on WW and WD lines in 2016 and 2017 and consisted in withholding irrigation on WD lines for one month during summer. Soil water potential (Ψ soil ) was monitored by Watermark® tensiometric probes (−30 and −60 cm depth) connected to Agribase® dataloggers on a subset of cultivars having shown contrasted vigor in a previous greenhouse experiment  4  . Results reported here are focused on the 2017 experimental campaign only. That year, the mean value of harvest fruit weight per tree over the population was 8.43 kg with a maximum of 39.48 kg. Although this 4 th year after planting corresponded to the first year of significant fruit production for most trees, some of them (8%) did not bear any fruit. From 7 th July to 2 nd August 2017, WW trees received 2 h irrigation per day, while WD trees were watered 2 h per day twice a week only. The water deficit was gradually established after irrigation withholding and Ψ soil reached up to -120 kPa for WD trees at the end of this period (late July 2017,  Supplementary Fig. S1 ) while Ψ soil on WW trees was maintained close to 0 kPa. All measurements presented hereafter were carried out at the end of July 2017, when contrast in Ψ soil between WW and WD trees nearly reached its maximum, except for the T-LiDAR acquisition, which was carried out in early October 2017. Thermal infrared and multispectral imaging Image acquisitions and experimental set-up Airborne imaging acquisition was carried out on clear sunny days, on 27 th July from 1 to 2 p.m. and on 28 th July from 9:30 to 10:30 a.m. (UTC). The vector was a Mik-rokopter® hexa-rotor drone (www.phenome-fppn.fr/ phenome_eng/Facilities/Montpellier-Field) operating at 25 m height. Three successive elevations were performed each day to cover the entire field, hence around 45 min were needed between the first and last image acquisition in the field. Zenithal images were acquired at frequency allowing image along-track and across-track overlaps of 80% and 70%, respectively. The on-ground field set-up comprised (i) gray targets for radiometric correction, (ii) contrasted thermal targets (2 m²) used during the flights and measured by IR120 thermoradiometers (Campbell Sci.), (iii) ground control points GPS-RTK (Global Position System-Real Time Kinematic) geo-referenced (2.5 cm accuracy), and (iv) a meteorological station acquiring air temperature and relative humidity, wind speed and direction, and global radiation at 10 s time-step. TIR and MS images were acquired, respectively, by a FLIR® TAU2.7 uncooled camera (7.5-13 μm, resolution of 640 × 512 pixels) and an AirPhen v3 camera (www.hiphen-plant.com) measuring reflectance in blue (450 nm), green (530 and 570 nm), red (675 nm), red-edge (730 nm), and NIR (850 nm) with a bandwidth close to 10 nm. 
 Vegetation and water stress index computation Data post-processing (radiometric correction, image ortho-rectification, geolocation and mosaicking) was performed with Erdas Imagine Pro, ExifTool and Agisoft Photoscan softwares. Linear regressions between contrasted targets and IR120 temperatures allowed transforming the numerical values of image pixels into temperatures  28  . GPS coordinates were used to accurately localize each single tree of the experiment and a 0.70 m radius zone (buffer zone,  Supplementary Fig. S2 ) was delineated around tree centers. For the canopy temperature (T surf ) calculation, the leaf MS signature was used to classify images and discard soil pixels. Differences between surface and air temperatures (T surf -T air )  29  were then computed by subtracting the mean air temperature during the acquisition. MS-based index values (NDVI, GNDVI, PRI, and MCARI2) were extracted for each pixel within the buffer zone  (Supplementary Table S1 ). For each index, mean and standard deviation of pixels values were calculated inside the buffer zone, considering vegetation pixels for T surf -T air or all the pixels for MS-based indices. The WDI  (Supplementary Table S1 ) was computed based on a trapezoid shape built from the scatterplot between T surf -T air and NDVI  21, 30  . WDI is an indicator used for estimating the effect of water deficit on leaf transpiration, varying from 0 (maximal transpiration) to 1 (no transpiration). 
 High-throughput estimation of leaf photosynthesis Estimation of a semi-empirical index (I PL ) Following Losciale et al.  17  , the semi-empirical index I PL was used as a proxy for net leaf photosynthetic rate (A n ). It was computed as a linear combination of the electron transport rate exiting from PSII (J PSII , derived from the effective PSII quantum efficiency, ΦPSII) aggregated with the Michaelis-Menten constants for carboxylation (K C ) and photorespiration (K O ) forming a new variable, P KO / K C = J PSII × K O /K C , and the leaf-to-air temperature difference (T leaf -T air ). Calibration of the linear regression was achieved through measurements on a subset of six genotypes (24 trees). Leaf gas-exchanges were measured using an open circuit InfRared Gas-exchange Analyzer (IRGA) fitted with a leaf fluorimeter and a light-emitting diode light source (LI-6400, LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) on 30 th July. Measurements were performed with two LI-COR devices on fully expanded, fully exposed leaves and repeated at three time-periods: morning, midday, afternoon with actinic light set to 1500 μmol m −2 s −1 . During each measurement, we recorded A n , stomatal conductance (g s ), leaf (T leaf ) and air (T air ) temperatures, maximum fluorescence with light-adapted leaf (F m '), and steady state fluorescence (F s ) in order to compute ΦPSII. We collected with each device, respectively, 98 (LI-COR 1) and 132 (LI-COR 2) measurements. In the calibration process, two thirds of the data were used for estimating model coefficients in the two datasets. For each device, linear models were established gathering all the data collected, and their validity was assessed across watering scenarios or time of the day. Model validation was performed on the remaining third of the datasets, using the coefficients determined in the calibration process. 
 High-throughput measurements of I PL HT measurements were performed on 4 trees × 195 genotypes during 2 consecutive days (27 th and 28 th July) with the two LI-COR devices complementarily. Measurements consisted in rapid (ca. 30 s per leaf) acquisition of ΦPSII, T leaf , and T air , performed during a maximum period of 3 h around solar midday. Parameters calculated in the calibration process were then used for each LI-COR to calculate I PL values. 
 In planta measurement of leaf stomatal conductance Stomatal conductance (g s ) was measured on 27 th July on a subset of eight genotypes (two WW and two WD trees per genotype) with a porometer (AP4; Delta-T Devices Ltd). Measurements were performed on three fully expanded, fully sun-exposed leaves per tree, during a period of 1 h 30 min centered around solar midday. Stomatal conductance values were then compared to T surf -T air and WDI estimated from TIR imaging and to T leaf -T air estimated with IRGAs to assess the ability of the difference between air and vegetation temperatures to account for functional differences. High-throughput phenotyping of whole-tree leaf area and light interception T-LiDAR data acquisition Data acquisition was performed on the whole population in October 2017 after harvest, with a RIEGL VZ400 terrestrial laser scanner (RIEGL Laser Measurement Systems GmbH, Horn, Austria). Scans were carried out with a 360°view each ten meters on every row with an angular resolution of 0.04°. Scans were then registered in a common coordinates system with the Riegl software (RiSCAN PRO v2.0.1) and point clouds were processed using the Computree platform (http://computree.onf.fr/) (  Fig. 1a)  to remove noise and outlier points. 
 Plant shape and light interception descriptors Volumes of convex hulls (c_volume) of the tree point clouds were computed using the PlantGL library 31 within OpenAlea platform  32  and volumes of alpha hulls (a_volume) with R software 33 using the alphashape3d library. The c_volume reflects the maximal space occupation of the tree, while a_volume is an extension of the convex hull allowing the creation of concave envelopes around the point cloud and is consequently more associated with the space really occupied by the trees. Creation of concavities in the alpha hull depends on a parameter (α) whose value was estimated on a subset of 20 trees on which the total tree leaf areas (TLAs) were estimated by randomly collecting one leaf over five within the canopy. Individual areas of collected leaves were then measured using a leaf area meter (LI-COR 3100, Area Meter; Lincoln, NE, USA). The chosen α value (0.15) was the one maximizing the correlation between a_volume and TLA on this subset of trees. A convexity index (c i ) was computed as the ratio of a_volume to c_volume to evaluate the density of tree space occupation within its convex hull. A proxy of light interception efficiency, the STAR, was computed in PlantGL following previously published methods  34  . The trunk cross sectional area (TCSA) was computed from the trunk circumference acquired with a tape measure on the whole core-collection in September 2017. As  
 Statistical analyses Analyses were performed using R software  33  . For each trait, models were selected based on the lowest Bayesian Information Criterion, among several mixed-effect models  (Supplementary Table S2 ). Models always included a random genotypic effect and a fixed-effect of the scenario, completed or not by other fixed effects (line, daytime period, gas-exchange device, climatic conditions). The best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs) of genetic values were estimated for each trait with the selected model. Variance components were then used to estimate the broad-sense heritability (H 2 ) as: H 2 ¼ σ 2 G σ 2 G þ σ 2 R n h i ð1Þ with σ 2 G the genetic variance, σ 2 R the residual variance, n the number of replicates per genotype. Multivariate analyses were performed on the genetic values. Pearson coefficients of correlation between variables were evaluated, considering phenotypic and genotypic values. A PCA and a Hierarchical Ascendant Classification based on Ward method were performed, using variables related to architectural and functional traits and estimated from the three different HT methods. Some variables closely correlated to other ones were not considered in these multivariate analyses to limit redundancies. 
 Results 
 Characterization of tree architecture and effect on light interception efficiency Correlation between a_volume and TLA  (Table 1) , assessed on 20 trees with TLA ranging from 0.3 to 6.2 m², was highly significant (R² = 0.89,  Fig. 1b) . a_volume was positively, highly significantly correlated to TCSA on the whole core-collection  (Fig. 1c , R² = 0.43). a_volume was also highly correlated to pix_num estimated from the zenithal airborne images  (Fig. 1d , R² = 0.47). By contrast, the correlation between c_volume and other variables related to tree vigor were lower (R² = 0.26, for both TCSA and pix_num,  Fig. 1e  and  Supplementary Fig. S3 ). All parameters estimated from T-LiDAR exhibited strong effect of the genotype and high heritability values (H² from 0.77 to 0.86;  Table 2 ). A slight but significant effect of the watering scenario was found on all traits (except a_volume), associated with a moderate decrease in the size of the trees under WD as compared to WW conditions (e.g., -3.7% and -10.4% for a_volume and c_volume, respectively). Higher c i was observed under WD, suggesting a higher leaf area density. Consistently, higher leaf area density led to WD trees with lower STAR values (  Table 2) . We explored the correlations between the variables derived from T-LiDAR measurements to evaluate the relationship between tree vegetative architecture and light interception efficiency as estimated by STAR values. a_volume was positively correlated to c_volume whatever the watering scenario with R² = 0.44  (Fig. 2a)  showing however a range of contrasted combinations of a_volume and c_volume values within the core-collection. STAR was negatively correlated with c i  (Fig. 2c ; R² = 0.65, power function) and weakly, negatively correlated with a_volume (  Fig. 2b ; R² = 0.22). Finally, a_volume was significantly, but not tightly, correlated to NDVI estimated from MS images  (Fig. 2d, R² = 0.38) . 
 Variability of the multispectral indices Vegetation indices resulting both from functional and architectural plant features were computed from MS imaging. All indices (NDVI, GNDVI, MCARI2, and PRI, Tables 1 and 2) exhibited a wide range of variability within the core-collection. They displayed a strong effect of the genotype and high heritabilities (0.70 < H² < 0.87). High-positive phenotypic correlations were found  Table 2  Range of variability for the traits (mean ± SD) measured on the core-collection of apple trees, with effects of the genotype, of the watering scenario, and broad-sense heritability Acronyms as in  Table 1 . The significance of genotype (P G ), watering scenario (P S ), and date effects (P D ) was tested considering a linear fixed-effect model without interaction. ****p ≤ 0.001; ns, non-significant. Date effect is considered for imaging data, only between NDVI and GNDVI on one hand (R² = 0.52), and between NDVI and MCARI2 on the other hand (R² = 0.76,  Table 3 ). By contrast, the correlation between GNDVI and MCARI2 was low, although significant (R² = 0.09). Importantly, these correlations were conserved when considering genotypic values, evidencing the consistent behaviors across trees of the same genotype. PRI was positively correlated with GNDVI (R² = 0.40), slightly with MCARI2 (negative correlation) and not correlated with NDVI if genotypic correlations were considered  (Table 3 ). Water deficit generally had a low but significant effect on all the MS imaging indices, except GNDVI, with a relative variation between WW and WD of about 10%  (Table 2) .  
 Phenotypic values Using fluorescence measurements for estimating genotypic variation of photosynthesis In this study, leaf fluorescence measurements were used as a proxy for photosynthesis activity in order to extend the functional phenotyping of the core-collection. The calibration dataset for the I PL model covered a wide range of variation for A n (from 2 to 30 μmol m −2 s −1 ,  Fig. 3a  and  Supplementary Fig. S4a ). The device (two IRGAs were used) impacted the range of values recorded for T air , T leaf , and ΦPSII  (Supplementary Table S3 ), likely due to internal calibration proper to each. Thus, a specific set of parameters was chosen for each device. Both P KO/KC and T leaf -T air  (Table 1 ) had highly significant effects on I PL (p < 0.0001), confirming the relevance of using both parameters to estimate photosynthesis accurately. Calibrations were robust (R² = 0.86 and 0.84,  Fig. 3a  and  Supplementary Fig. S4a ) and a unique set of parameter values was relevant whatever the scenario or period (R² > 0.79 when splitting the calibration dataset per scenario or daytime). Accuracy was confirmed by the high values of R² and root mean square errors (RMSE) obtained in the validation datasets (  Fig. 3b  and  Supplementary Fig. S4b , R² = 0.77 and 0.74, respectively, and RMSE = 3.1 and 3.2, respectively). I PL values were then estimated at HT on the core-collection, from the calibrated model, and ranged from 0 to 27 among the WW trees and from -5 to 25 for WD ones, with a significant effect of the genotype (  Table 2) . WD decreased I PL values by 30% on average as compared to WW conditions (  Table 2  and  Fig. 3c ). Its variation within the core-collection was mostly driven by variability in P KO/KC  (Fig. 3e , R² = 0.82), which combines electron transport rate exiting from PSII (J PSII ), in turn dependent on the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation and effective PSII efficiency, and, to a lesser extent, by variability in T leaf -T air  (Fig. 3d, R² = 0.22) , itself related to the degree of stomatal closure. Variations in air VPD along the measurement duration also significantly affected I PL values  (Supplementary Fig. S5 ). We thus Data collected at three measurement period (morning, midday, afternoon) are identified with different symbols. In a and b, calibration and validation are presented for one of the two IRGA devices used (see  Supplementary Fig. S4  for the second one). c Boxplot representation of the I PL measured at high-throughput on the whole core-collection (n = 800 trees).

Blue and red points represent trees subjected to well-watered (WW) or water deficit (WD) conditions, respectively. Coefficients of determination and their significances were computed considering either the whole dataset (all), or within each watering scenario independently (WW or WD). Root mean square errors were estimated to assess the consistency of correlations between A n and I PL integrated these undesired effects (device, VPD) into the mixed-models used for BLUPs and heritability calculation (Supplementary  Table S2 ). This yielded medium heritability for I PL (H² = 0.43,  Table 2 ). Low correlation coefficients, although sometimes significant due to the large number of individuals, were found between the I PL and the vegetation indices derived from MS imaging  (Table 3) . 
 High-throughput characterization of whole-plant response to water deficit Our experimental design allowed to further investigate the response of genotypes to soil water deficit as two plants per genotype were subjected to soil water deficit conditions. Whole-plant sensitivity to water deficit was analyzed with two main variables computed from airborne images: T surf -T air and WDI  (Fig. 4a) , over two consecutive dates (27 th July at midday and 28 th July morning). The acquisition date had a highly significant effect on both variables, with lower values on 28 th July (mean T surf -T air = 3.07 and 0.64°C, and WDI = 0.27 and 0.22 for all the trees in 27 th July and 28 th July, respectively). The lower values on 28 th July were likely due to the daytime period differing between both dates, with lower temperature and VPD  (Supplementary Fig. S6 ) in the morning conditions that led to higher stomatal conductance and transpiration rate. Moreover, as image acquisition extended over >45 min with three different elevations for each flight date, some variations also existed within each day of measurement  (Supplementary Fig. S6 ). Despite changes in absolute values, correlations between data collected on the two dates and corrected based on the fixed effects of day and flight within the day remained significant although with medium correlation coefficients  (Supplementary Fig. S7 ). On 27 th July, the four temperatures used for estimating the trapezoid relationship between NDVI and T surf -T air were, respectively, equal to 0.87, −1.34, 21.86, and 5.6°C for saturated bare soil, well-watered vegetation, dry bare  Fig. 4  Impact of water deficit on the water deficit index (WDI) and the surface-to-air temperature difference (T surf -T air ). a Thermal pixel array within the buffer zone estimated from thermal infrared (TIR) imaging on four trees belonging to two genotypes (X1180 and X0972) under wellwatered (WW) and water deficit (WD) conditions on 27 th July.

Gray points represent all the pixels, including soil, weed, and trees, whereas red and blue points are the mean values of T surf -T air and NDVI for each individual tree (blue: WW trees, red: WD trees). Solid lines represent the trapezoid shape used for computing WDI.

In c-e data are phenotypic values (n = 930), corrected for fixed effects of date and daytime period. The significance of the watering scenario was assessed with a one-way ANOVA. ***Significant at p < 0.001 soil, and water-stressed vegetation, respectively  (Fig. 4b) . Consistently with the observed T surf -T air , these temperatures were lower on 28 th July (  Supplementary Fig. S8 ). As expected, whatever the date, T surf -T air and WDI  (Fig. 4c, e and Supplementary Fig. S8b, c)  increased under water deficit conditions. Moreover, large variations were observed for WD trees with a genotypic coefficient of variation equal to 0.41 and 0.32 under WD conditions for T surf -T air and WDI, respectively. T surf -T air was more heterogeneous within tree canopy under WD as compared to WW conditions, as shown by the higher standard deviation computed from all vegetation pixels of each tree (  Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. S8d ). Mixed-effect models accounting for scenario, date and elevation effects within each day were used for WDI and T surf -T air on the dataset combining the 2 days of measurements  (Supplementary Table S2 ), yielding high heritabilities for both traits (  Table 2) . 
 Assessments of high-throughput phenotyping methods for functional traits The relevance of HT measurements of functional traits was assessed by comparing T surf -T air derived from imaging to low-throughput measurements with the IRGA of these variables and to stomatal conductance values. We thus explored the relation between g s and the leaf-to-air temperature difference considering the latter at different scales: (i) at the canopy level (mean value of T surf -T air derived from imaging), and (ii) at the leaf level (T leaf -T air measured with the IRGA during the I PL measurements, on one of every three leaves per tree measured with the porometer). Significant correlations between T surf -T air (respectively, T leaf -T air ) or WDI and g s were observed when considering the whole dataset (WW and WD) or the WD plants only  (Fig. 5a, c) . Nevertheless, these correlations were no longer significant for the WW trees. T leaf -T air and T surf -T air were significantly correlated  (Fig. 5d ) but this correlation was mostly driven by the contrast between WW and WD trees, whereas it was no longer significant to discriminate the individuals within each watering regime separately. Vegetation temperature was significantly lower when measured with the IRGA as compared to canopy imaging even though these temperatures were measured at the same time of the day  (Fig. 5d) . For most of the genotypes, the temperature measured with the IRGA ranked into the first quartile of  Fig. 5  Assessment of high-throughput methods for computing leaf or surface temperatures. a Correlation between leaf-to-air temperature difference (T leaf -T air ) measured with the gas-exchange analyzer during the I PL measurement, and stomatal conductance (g s ) measured with the porometer. b Correlation between the mean value of surface-to-air temperature difference (T surf -T air ) obtained by thermal infrared imaging (TIR) and g s measured with the porometer. c Correlation between water deficit index (WDI) and g s measured with the porometer. d Correlation between T leaf -T air measured with the gas-exchange analyzer during the I PL measurement, and the mean value of T surf -T air obtained by TIR imaging. In a-c, n = 40 trees; in d, n = 400 trees. All measurements were performed on the same day. g s and T leaf -T air were measured, respectively, on three and one single leaf per tree. Mean T surf -T air was calculated overall the pixels of each tree the pixel canopy temperature estimated from airborne imagery (  Supplementary Figs. S9 and 10) . 
 Identification of genotype classes based on architectural and functional traits We performed a PCA analysis on the BLUPs estimated on the whole core-collection with mixed-effect models including, when significant, the watering scenario as fixed-effect to explore the quantitative relationships between variables and similarities between genotypes. Seven variables were chosen to encompass traits (i) related to plant architecture (c_volume, a_volume), (ii) combining plant architecture and functioning (NDVI, MCARI2, STAR), (iii) accounting for the limitation in leaf functioning due to soil water content (WDI) and (iv) representing leaf photosynthesis (I PL ). The first two axes explained >66% of the variance and the first four axes >94% (46.1%, 18.4%, 15.2%, 14.6% for axes 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively,  Fig. 6a, b and Supplementary Fig. S11 ). The variability in the population was first explained by a combination of variables related to the size of the tree (a_volume, NDVI, MCARI2, PCA's axis 1) and second by STAR, and to a lower extent c_volume (PCA's axis 2). The third and fourth dimensions were almost fully explained by one variable, only (I PL or WDI, respectively). A hierarchical clustering  (Fig. 6c, d)     
 Discussion An original combination of high-throughput tools to phenotype thousands of trees under contrasted watering regimes HT phenotyping methods were combined to study the genotypic variability of variables related to plant architecture (a_volume, c_volume, c i , STAR), functioning (I PL ), sensitivity to soil water deficit (WDI, T surf -T air ) and ""mixed"" traits accounting both for architectural and functional characteristics (NDVI, GNDVI, MCARI2). This study thus extends the domain of application of new HT methods, up to now mostly deployed on annual species  18  . To assess the accuracy of these methods, the traits measured at HT were compared to in planta measurements, or to other traits acquired at HT with an alternative method. For architectural variables, the significant correlations between a_volume, TLA, TCSA, pix_num, and NDVI confirm the relevance of using T-LiDAR or airborne imagery for characterizing whole-tree development. Nevertheless, correlations between T-LiDAR variables and NDVI were quite low, likely due to the nature of NDVI, which also accounts for features not directly associated with plant architecture (i.e., chlorophyll content). Architectural variables were complemented with STAR estimations. STAR was negatively correlated with a_volume and c i . This first suggests that plants with large leaf area have lower radiation absorption per unit leaf area, probably due to leaf over-lapping, as previously observed  36  , and second, that c i is a good indicator of foliage 3D distribution within the canopy. Interestingly, large genotypic variability was also found among genotypes for GNDVI and MCARI2, which both depend on leaf area index and chlorophyll concentration  24, 25  . PRI, which is less dependent on tree architecture but closely associated with radiation-use efficiency, also displayed large variability. Overall, our results underline the relevance of using a 6-channel multispectral acquisition in combination with thermal infrared imagery, which allowed a high spatial resolution and proved to be cost-effective  37  . A technical alternative could rely on hyperspectral acquisition, whose non a-priori approach and high spectral resolution is tempting but would imply lower spatial resolution and more challenging data analysis. Subsequently, in order to estimate photosynthesis at the leaf level, we computed a semi-empirical parameter (I PL ) estimated using a calibration-validation procedure, which revealed the accuracy of this indicator independently of climate or watering scenario. While it was proposed that the model parameters were species specific 17 , we show that they also vary with the device used, hence the importance of running calibration measurements for any new experiment. Relevant design and analytical methods allow detecting strong genotypic variability in response to water deficit Experimental design and timing of measurements are critical to ensure successful HT characterization. In our case, due to local regulation, the drone flight had to be carried out at reduced altitude, thus requiring several successive elevations to cover the entire field. This results Group effect *** *** *** *** *** *** *** in variations of environmental conditions with T surf following the variations of T air and VPD. By repeating measurements over 2 consecutive days at two distinct periods, we were able to compare the effect of external conditions. Measurements centered on solar midday offered more stabilized conditions. Similarly, for the leaf fluorescence measurements, we made sure to perform measurements under saturating solar radiation conditions to avoid any pitfalls frequently reported as fluorescence measurements are dependent on the ambient light levels  13  . Importantly, the use of mixed-effect models was crucial to get rid of the environmental, uncontrolled variability (e.g., fixed effects of elevation for the airborne imagery-derived indices; of the VPD for the I PL ). With this approach, we were thus able to evidence strong genotypic effects on all the studied variables, most of them displaying high heritabilities (H² > 0.6). Whereas strong genotypic effects on indices derived from airborne imagery were similarly found on annual crops 38 , such high values were not frequently reported on woody crops (e.g., no effect of the genotype from TIR imagery on a poplar biparental population  39  ). For architectural traits, heritabilities were similar to or even higher than those obtained in previous studies in field on biparental population 7 or on the same core-collection in controlled conditions 4 , thus confirming the strong genetic determinism of architectural traits. Marked genotypic differences were observed between the effects of the watering regimes on the architectural and functional variables. Functional traits revealed average reductions by >30% in I PL and to a lesser extent in PRI. Leaf temperature strongly increased under water deficit (around + 2°C) probably due to stomatal closure under these conditions. Such responses are consistent with rapid changes in leaf homeostasis upon soil drying, likely due to hormonal or hydraulic regulations  40  . On the other hand, vegetative and architectural traits (e.g., a_volume, NDVI) only showed a slight, not always significant reduction in WD as compared to WW trees. Indeed, these integrative traits were built over the whole 4-years tree life, while the WD condition was only established during one month in 2016 and 2017. Besides, in these 2 years, the WD occurred in July, when most of the vegetative development was already achieved. 
 On the consistency and discrepancies between scales of analysis The scale of analysis (from the leaf to the whole-plant) is a recurrent matter of debate for the study of functional traits. Complementarity of our approaches allows tackling this question within the apple core-collection. ""Groundtruthing"" measurements (e.g., stomatal conductance by porometry) are often conducted in parallel to airborne image acquisitions and confronted to TIR or MS indices. This results in a profusion of studies reporting a wide range of correlations between canopy indices and in planta measurements (e.g., R² between g s and T surf -T air ranging from 0.27 to 0.92 in several woody crops  41, 42  ). In our study, the simultaneous measurement of T leaf -T air (IRGA) and of T surf -T air (TIR imaging) reveals that a well exposed, well developed leaf typically chosen for gasexchange measurements generally, but not systematically, falls within the first quartile of values reported from zenithal images on the same tree (Supplementary Figs. S9 and 10 and  Fig. 5d) . Consistently, the correlation found between T surf -T air and g s was significant with a medium R² (0.43) mostly driven by the contrast between watering scenarios rather than genotypes  (Fig. 5a) , consistent with other reports  39  . Another example is the low correlation found between the I PL measured on single leaves and the PRI associated with leaf fluorescence but also known to be highly affected by factors such as canopy structure, viewing and illumination geometry effects, and background  43  . As leaves within a tree strongly differ in terms of size, age, position or nitrogen content, care should thus be taken when confronting scales and thinking in terms of comparison should be preferred rather than in terms of validation. Upscaling to the canopy level and assessing the sample heterogeneity, as authorized by imagery techniques, might be crucial to extract relevant information on tree functioning. 
 Toward genetic analyses of tree performances in a genotype × environment interaction context Based on the BLUPs extracted for each trait, we were able to identify six distinct genotypic classes. These results demonstrate the absence of unique relationships between tree functioning, size and architecture, suggesting independent genetic controls. This result also suggests sink activity regulation or other developmental controls (transcriptome, hormones) as drivers of plant growth and phenotype construction  44  . Moreover, the large variations in tree crop loads in the core-collection could have hidden a relationship between architectural and functional traits due to feedback inhibition of photosynthesis under low crop load conditions  45  . This work will benefit from recent advances in genotyping and the availability of a high-density map for the apple core-collection  46  to explore the genetic bases of trait variations, using genome-wide association studies. Whereas classical QTL analyses led on fruit tree species often tackle a unique type of traits (e.g., architecture 7 ; phenology 47 ), our work will offer the opportunity to simultaneously decipher the genetic control of architectural and functional traits. The wide genetic background offered by the core-collection promises a gain for the power of detection and the genericity of detected QTLs as compared to classical approaches led on biparental populations  48  . The portability of our approach will also allow its deployment over other sites across Europe on the same core-collection  47  and a unique opportunity to decipher the genotype-by-environment interactions ruling the traits of interest. Our protocol could be deployed throughout the gradual establishment of water deficit in order to compute response curve parameters depending on the genotype. Such an approach will complement the results of this study in which we considered the water stress treatment as a fixed-effect at one date. The robustness of our HT indices also suggest their relevance for studies oriented toward agronomical questions, e.g., orchard management on a few varieties. Nevertheless, their further deployment would require the creation of standardized protocols and common data analysis pipelines accessible to non-expert users. This could be achieved within open-access platforms dedicated to phenotyping data analyses (e.g., OpenAlea 32 ). Finally, this study was carried out on fruiting adult trees but did not directly account for the HT evaluation of fruit production variation within the population. A number of imagery methods at HT were proposed to detect fruits within the canopy  49  . Nevertheless, this detection is not straightforward due to the large variability in fruit characteristics (size, color) within such a collection. To overcome this problem, new popular methods for remote sensing data based on deep learning could be used to improve the classification of fruits and leaves within the canopy  50  .

Groups of large and small plants then differed depending on STAR values (strongly associated with the ratio of a_volume to c_volume) with groups 4 and 2 displaying low values, for small and large plants, respectively (

This is not possible for F1 Arabica hybrids, as they are highly heterozygous and their characteristics segregate in F2 progeny produced by self-pollination. The advantages of using Arabica hybrids were first demonstrated in Kenya with the complex hybrid cultivar Ruiru 11, developed in the 1970s and released in 1986 to be cultivated in Kenya  (Walyaro 1983 ;  Van der Vossen, 1985) , then in Tanzania  (Teri et al., 2005; Van der Vossen et al., 2015) . Breeding strategies aiming to develop new F1 hybrid cultivars (from two parents) of Arabica coffee were proposed simultaneously in Ethiopia  (Bellachew, 1997)  and in Central America  Bertrand et al., 2011) . In Central America, the strategy was based on crossing American cultivars with wild Ethiopian accessions. Like many other hybrid plants, C. arabica F1 hybrids possess genetic and agronomic advantages  (Gallais, 2009) , such as higher and more stable yields, more vigor, disease resistance, better cup quality, and adaptability to agroforestry systems  (Bertrand et al., 2005; Bertrand et al., 2011) . These authors showed that F1 hybrids produced 11-47% higher yield than the best cultivars along with significantly higher or identical 100-bean weight and performed identically for fertility. To assess whether using hybrids represents substantial genetic progress on terms of productivity and full-sun cropping systems, the new F1 hybrids were grown in the same conditions as the best American cultivars. The results showed that yields of hybrids were earlier and superior to those of American cultivars. The hybrids were also more stable than the American cultivars in all environments tested. In the agroforestry system, the mean yield of hybrids was 58% higher than that of American cultivars, while the mean yield of hybrids in the full-sun system was 34% higher. So, by combining more productivity, better adaptability to agroforestry system, more resistance, and better cup quality, F1 hybrids are a promising alternative to conventional cultivars. Once created, several methods exist to multiply these new F1 hybrids on a large scale. As previously reported in Kenya and Ethiopia, the first method consisted in producing F1 seeds by hand pollination  (Opile and Agwanda, 1993; Bellachew, 1997) . In that case, and because Arabica flowers are hermaphrodite and autogenic, it was necessary to emasculate them before pollinating by hand. For coffee, this approach has proven difficult to implement on a large scale. The second method was to produce clonal F1 hybrid plants by different micropropagation technics. In Tanzania for example, through the full participation of some 600 farmer groups, the F1 hybrids were multiplied by rooted cuttings and grafting  (Magesa et al., 2013) . On the other hand, the ECOM/Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique Pour le Développement (CIRAD) consortium produced an average of one million F1 Arabica hybrid coffee plants per year by somatic embryogenesis (SE) in Nicaragua  (Etienne et al., 2012; Etienne et al., 2018) . Although this approach worked technically, it was not economically viable due to its high costs linked to manpower and the infrastructures required (laboratories and nurseries) (  Van der Vossen et al., 2015) . We recently showed that the cost of F1 coffee plants could be reduced by the half, if plants were produced by a combination of SE and rooted mini-cuttings technics  (Georget et al., 2015b) . A 6-month-old nursery hybrid plant propagated from a somatic seedling and ready for the field, which has a production cost of around 0.60 USD, whereas the same hybrid plant produced by rooted mini-cuttings has a production cost of around 0.27 USD. However, the price of such F1 hybrids produced first by SE, then re-multiplied by rooted minicuttings, is still 1.5 times the cost of traditional seedling, which still remains too high and constitutes a major deterrent for small coffee farmers  (Georget et al., 2017) . Lastly, the third method consisted in producing F1 seeds in seed gardens using a sterile male line as the female plant  (Georget et al., 2015a) . Male sterility is common in flowering plants, but its application in hybrid breeding and seed production is limited because of the inability to propagate a pure sterile male line for commercial hybrid seed production  (Chang et al., 2016) . There is therefore a limited number of publications reporting on the use of sterile male genotypes to produce hybrid seeds at commercial level. Numerous hybrid crops that are significant components of world production (>50%) such as tomato and maize are produced by hand emasculation, while spinach and the cucurbits hybrid seeds are produced by monoecy and the brassicas by self-incompatibility  (Havey, 2004) . For other crops, such as rice, wheat, and sorghum, commercial quantities of hybrid seeds can only be obtained by using sterile male female parents created by chemical or genetic manipulations  (Wu et al., 2016) . In this case, the successful application of such systems for large-scale hybrid seed production depends on whether the sterile male female parent line can be multiplied efficiently and economically  (Perez-Prat and Van Lookeren Campagne, 2002) . Compared with other methods, these hybrid seeds offer the advantages of being produced in quantity, easily handled, stored, and transported, and are much more affordable for farmers. With an annual renewal rate estimated at over one billion trees for C. arabica  (B. Bertrand, personal communication) , this type of propagation by seeds should allow rapid and large-scale dissemination of Arabica F1 hybrids. In this paper, we evaluated the implementation of a seed production system using the C. arabica sterile male CIR-SM01, and we evaluated the performance of the first F1 hybrid, ""Starmaya, "" obtained by male sterility in comparison with conventional cultivars. 
 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 C. arabica Sterile Male CIR-SM01 In 2001, researchers from CIRAD found a natural tall growth habit mutant (called CIR-SM01) of C. arabica without any pollen production, by screening Ethiopian plants at the Centro Agronómico Tropical de Investigación y Enseñanza (CATIE) germplasm bank for coffee in Costa Rica. Plants of CIR-SM01 were then multiplied in vitro in clonal form by SE (Atlantic S.A. laboratory, Sebacco, Nicaragua). Somatic embryos derived from plantlets were first acclimatized in plastic tunnels for 2 months in trays, then hardened in nurseries for 4 months before planting in the field and further used as mother receptors (  Figures  1A, B) . After this process, it was checked that the sterile male phenotype was not affected by temperature or photoperiodsensitive, as described in rice for example  (Zhang et al., 1994) . This mutation displayed complete and stable sterility, whatever the environmental conditions and the age of the plant (juvenile or mature). The molecular basis of this mutation is still unknown, but we found in a previous study  (Dufour et al., 1997)  that phenotypic expression of this male sterility is functional, occurring during microsporogenesis, and is the product of a malfunction of the tapetum in the early microspore stages. At the same time, we planted four F2 populations (1,250 plants), and we checked that the mutation was recessive, giving a proportion of 18.3% sterile male plants. This proportion may have been the product of a Mendelian recessive epistatic interaction with a 9:4:3 ratio. 
 Marsellesa® Cultivar of C. arabica The Marsellesa ® cultivar (https://www.upov.int/pluto/en/) is a Sarchimor cultivar selected (F8) with complete resistance to leaf rust disease (coffee leaf rust caused by Hemileia vastatrix) and to coffee berry disease (caused by Colletotrichum kahawae), as described in the World Coffee Research variety catalog (https://varieties.worldcoffeeresearch.org/). Compared with a traditional dwarf cultivar, such as Caturra red, Marsellesa ® produces up to 10% more, with good organoleptic qualities. Seeds from Marsellesa ® were taken from a plantation located on the ""La Cumplida"" farm (Matagalpa, Nicaragua) and sprouted for 45 days in a germinator  (Figures 1C, D) . The resulting seedlings were transferred to nursery bags for 4 months to be fully acclimatized, then planted in the field to be further used as pollen donors. 
 Creation of the Starmaya Hybrid Cultivar In a preliminary study, we first investigated the possibility of producing F1 hybrid seeds by crossing (by hand pollination) the sterile male CIR-SM01 separately with several C. Arabica cultivars with a dwarf growth habit (e.g., Caturra red, Catuai 44, IAPAR59, and Marsellesa ® ) used as pollen donors and evaluating the agronomic performances of the corresponding F1 progenies under field growing conditions (data not shown). In this trial, all plants were fertile with better vegetative vigor than the control (Caturra red). Of the four combinations tested, the best cross was the ""CIR-SM01 × Marsellesa ® "" F1 population, which we called ""Starmaya."" This candidate cultivar yielded 30% more of green beans than Marsellesa ® , with a standard to good beverage quality and rust resistance. The combinations with Caturra red and Catuai 44 were discarded due to high susceptibility to rust, and the combination with IAPAR59 presented a cup quality inferior to the Caturra red standard. This first step was carried out on a few plants, so we decided to evaluate the agronomic performance of this new cultivar on a larger scale by comparing it with conventional ones and to validate the concept of commercially producing Starmaya hybrid seeds using male sterility and natural pollination. 
 Set up of the Starmaya Seed Garden To produce hybrid seeds, we planted CIR-SM01 together with Marsellesa ® , assuming that the pollen of Marsellesa ® would be able to pollinate the sterile male naturally. The proportion was approximately one pollen donor for four sterile male plants used as mothers. The first experimental seed garden, isolated from alien pollen contamination, was planted in 2009 on the ""La Cumplida"" farm (950 m above sea level, district of Matagalpa, Nicaragua) on half a hectare (2,000 trees), with 1,600 CIR-SM01 somatic seedling plants and 400 Marsellesa ® plants as pollen donors. The planting density was 1.25 m along the row and 2 m between rows, i.e., 4,000 plants per hectare  (Figure 2) .  
 Multi-Site Trial to Assess the Performances of the Starmaya F1 Hybrid A multi-site trial was conducted across seven environments in Nicaragua for 5 years (2013 to 2018). The objective was to test the Starmaya F1 hybrid in multiple environments, in order to compare it with two conventional cultivars, Caturra red and Marsellesa ® . The agronomic management plan was identical at each site. The trials were established at seven sites ranging from 710 to 1,250 m above sea level. Implementation was identical for each site. Each site had five blocks, and each cultivar plot comprised 20 plants of each genotype. The Starmaya plot and the two control plots were randomly distributed in each block. The spacing between rows was 2.0 m, and the spacing between trees along a row was 1.5 m, corresponding to a planting density of around 3,300 trees per hectare. The sites are described in  Table 1 . Productivity was recorded over 3 years for each variety plot. The growth parameters were measured for five plants per genotype per block on 2-year-old plants. Rust resistance was evaluated for 10 plants per genotype per block in 2017 and 2018. Rust was evaluated on a scale of 0 to 4, with 0 = no symptoms, 1 = some rust spots without sporulation, 2 = majority of leaves with  rust spots without sporulation, 3 = majority of leaves with rust sporulation, and 4 = majority of leaves with rust sporulation and with defoliation. For plant morphology, the volume was estimated by the formula LP × H, where LP = length of the two longest primary branches (centimeters) and H = the height of the tree (centimeters). For bean characteristics, we estimated the weight of 100 healthy green beans (W100), and we screened the samples (5 kg for each genotype) through sieves (S14 to S20). Cup quality was assessed by six expert testers from Illy Caffè, with eight descriptors (aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body, balance, overall, and defects). A final score was assigned to each sample according to the Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) protocol (http://www.scaa.org/?page=resources&d=cupping-standards). To estimate the stability of Starmaya across the range of environments, productivity data were analyzed following the additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model. This model takes into account genotype and environment interactions  (Purchase et al., 2000; Bose et al., 2014; Darai et al., 2017) , with the Agricolae package in R. AMMI analyses were used to partition genotype × environment deviations into different interaction principal component axes (IPCA). AMMI analysis first fits additive effects for host genotypes and environments by the usual additive analysis of variance procedure and then fits multiplicative effects for G × E (genotype × environment) by a principal component analysis (PCA). AMMI Model: Yij gi ej k ik jk eij k n = + + + + = ∑ µ λ γ α 1 where µ is the general mean. Y ij is the yield of the i th genotype in the j th environment. g i is the i th genotype mean deviation. e j is the j th environment mean deviation. λ k is the square root of the eigenvalue of the PCA axis k, α ik and γ jk are the principal component scores for PCA axis k of the i th genotype and the j th environment, respectively. ε ij is the residual  (Zobel, 1998) . The AMMI stability value (ASV) described by  Purchase et al. (2000)  was calculated as follows: ASV IPCA sum of square IPCA sum of square IPCA score = 1 2 1 ( ) ) ( )       + 2 2 2 IPCA score where SSIPCA1/SSIPCA2 is the weight given to the IPCA1 value by dividing the interaction principal component analysis axis I (IPCA1) sum of squares by the IPCA2 sum of squares. The higher the IPCA score, either negative or positive, the more specifically adapted a genotype is to certain environments. Lower ASV scores indicate a more stable genotype across environments. 
 Setup of a Starmaya Commercial Field F1 seeds of Starmaya and Marsellesa ® were planted at La Cumplida (2012) in a field of 8 ha (1.25 m along rows × 2.25 m between rows). The 8 ha were divided into four blocks of 2 ha. Each block was subdivided in two equal plots of 1 ha for each genotype. We obtained a little production in 2014, but the first commercial production was in 2015. Four years after planting (2016), plant height, stem diameter, internode number, primary branch mortality, and primary branch length were measured on 300 plants randomly chosen for each genotype in the four blocks. Yield was measured as the quantity of green beans produced for each plot and expressed in bags of 46 kg ha -1 . Resistance to leaf rust was also evaluated by analyzing 300 plants of both varieties randomly chosen in the four previously described blocks. Rust resistance incidence was assessed during the rainy season, considered as the peak of fungus infestation observed on the farm on susceptible cultivars (i.e., Caturra red cv.). A plant was considered as susceptible if sporulation zones were observed on the abaxial surfaces of the leaves. The color of young leaves and shape of the plants (dwarf or tall) were observed three times and repeated if necessary when the information was ambiguous, until a consensus was reached. Marsellesa ® is considered completely resistant to the main races prevailing in Nicaragua, while CIR-MS01 is susceptible to this fungus. The coffee beans of Marsellesa ® and Starmaya were classified according to their defects, size distribution (sieve S13 to S20), and sensorial analyses. After the 2015-2016 harvest, 100 kg of cherries of each variety was processed by the wet method and was dried in the sun to approximately 11% moisture. The beans were then passed through a series of sieves, thereby being divided into classes of small (sieves 13 and 14), medium (15 to 17), and large (sieves 19 and 20) beans. The percentages of defects and exportable parchment coffee were evaluated for each cultivar following procedures routinely used by Exportadora Atlantic S.A factories at Sebaco in Nicaragua (ECOM group). Sensorial analyses of Marsellesa ® and Starmaya were performed twice with two trained tasters, based on the SCA protocol and using scales from 0 to 10 for the evaluated attributes. The Starmaya and Marsellesa ® cultivars where then compared with Caturra red cultivar harvested from a commercial plot located close to the experiment (200 m). The data corresponded to the mean of the two sensorial evaluations. 
 Simple Sequence Repeat Analysis In order to identify the homozygous/heterozygous allele patterns, as well as any existence of alien alleles, DNA was extracted from the leaves of 10 plants randomly selected for both parents (♂ Marsellesa ® and ♀CIR-SM01) and Starmaya F1 hybrids for further simple sequence repeat (SSR) analysis. In this case, leaf samples of CIR-SM01 were taken from plants grown in the seed garden and those of Starmaya and Marsellesa ® from plants grown in the agronomic trial. The SSR primer pairs used corresponded to those previously reported by  Anthony et al. (2002)  and  Gichuru et al. (2008)  (  Table 2) . The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reactions were performed in a 15-μl final volume comprising 30 ng of genomic DNA, 2 µmol ml -1 of magnesium dichloride, 300 nmol ml -1 of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, and 7.5 μl of 2× PCR buffer (Type it, Qiagen), 1.0 μM each of forward and reverse primer (10 µM). Amplifications were carried out in a thermal cycler (Eppendorf) programmed at 94°C for 5 min (initial denaturation), followed by 94°C for 30 s, annealing temperature (depending on each pair) for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min (extension) for 35 cycles, followed by a final extension step at 72°C for 5 min. PCR samples were then run on a capillary electrophoresis 3130XL with an internal standard (homemade). The SSR analysis was provided by the ADNid company (http://www.adnid.fr, Montpellier, France). 
 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 Potential Starmaya F1 Hybrid Seed Production of the Seed Garden Based on the results obtained from the CIR-SM01 and Marsellesa ® seed garden field, we found that natural pollination was efficient for producing Starmaya F1 hybrid seeds. In terms of seed production, an average of 100-150 kg of F1 hybrid seeds (data not shown) was harvested per year from this experiment (0.5 ha). These quantities amounted to potential production of approximately half a million hybrid seeds per hectare of seed garden, which should enable the planting of over 100-120 ha of Starmaya F1 hybrid coffee each year. The sterile male CIR-SM01 produced poorly compared with commercial cultivars, which usually produce around two million seeds under similar agronomic conditions. The cost of the seed produced by this sterile male progenitor was estimated to be about 0.07 USD per unit, corresponding to half the price of a coffee hybrid plantlet propagated by SE  (Georget et al., 2017) . This difference is mainly due to the fact that seed gardens are less expensive to set up and maintain than in vitro clonal propagation laboratories. Moreover, only a few micropropagation laboratories in the world are able to commercially produce such Arabica F1 hybrids, and none of them produces more than 2 million somatic embryo-derived plantlets per year, which represents a key constraint for the democratization of using such hybrids. No reliable statistic exists on the seed requirements for renovating coffee plantations worldwide. According to our calculations, and considering a renovation rate of 2 to 5% per year for Arabica crops estimated to cover 7 million hectares, it would be necessary to produce 250 to 500 million trees annually. Of course, this greatly depends on the coffee prices of international markets. Under a high coffee price, more than 1 billion plants could be required yearly for renovation worldwide. However, this requirement should not exceed 200-400 million plants per year when coffee prices are low. Consequently, 50 to 100 million plants of C. arabica F1 hybrids should be produced per year to have a major impact with the dissemination of such hybrids at the international level  (Bertrand B., personal communication) . In that case, this could be achieved by using 100 to 200 ha of seed garden with a sterile male coffee accession such as CIR-SM01. According to our current knowledge, it would be impossible to produce the same amount of F1 hybrids by SE.  Figure 3  shows the average yields for each genotype in kilograms of green beans per plant. The graph shows that the Starmaya hybrid produced more than traditional Caturra red and Marsellesa ® cultivars. A Tukey's honestly significant difference test was applied to determine significant differences between averages. Starmaya produced significantly more compared with Caturra red and Marsellesa ® (30% more per plant). 
 Starmaya Multi-Site Variety Trial By AMMI models, we evaluated and provided a stability index, the ASV. Genotypes with a low ASV are considered stable. The ASV allowed us to identify that Starmaya was the more stable genotype having the lowest ASV value (ASV = 0.308), while Marsellesa ® and Caturra red, with an ASV of 0.807 and 0.819, respectively, appeared less stable. The tree volume of Starmaya  (Figure 4 ) (0.89 m 3 ) was greater than that of Marsellesa ® and Caturra red (0.59 m 3 ). The differences are mainly due to lateral length and reflect strong vegetative vigor. Starmaya was found to be less susceptible to rust than Caturra red, but more than Marsellesa ® , due to the presence of some susceptible plants. As rust resistance background in Marsellesa ® is conferred by dominant genes, we concluded that some Starmaya plants do not inherit rust resistance. The W100 appeared higher for the Starmaya hybrid compared with the conventional cultivars (  Figure 5) . Starmaya had an average weight of 100 healthy green beans 25% higher than Caturra red. The higher W100 weight indicated better filling during bean development. Bean grade also plays an important role in marketing. The purchase price of bean is related to the density and size of the bean, and its healthy physical appearance. Beans are classified in 64th of an inch increments, with sizes between 14 to >19. Beans with screen sizes up to 15 are considered the highest quality in terms of size.  Figure 6  shows, for each cultivar, the percentage of beans of size 16 to 20 and the percentage of defective beans. FIGURE 4 | Relationship between productivity and two parameters: tree volume and susceptibility to rust. Treatment with the same letter are not significantly different at P ≤ 0.05 (Tukey's honestly significant difference test). October 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 1344 Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org Starmaya gave a higher percentage of green beans of size 16 to 20 than the two controls and 1% more defective beans. As concerns sensorial perception, according to the SCA method, coffees with a score of less than 80 are considered to be of inferior quality. Coffee beverages that have a score between 80 and 84.99 are very good, and beyond 85, they are excellent or exceptional. Cup quality varies depending on genotypes and altitudes.  Table 3  shows that Starmaya was better rated than Caturra red and obtained scores over or equal to 80, being very good at the highest altitude (>83).    
 Phenotypic and Yield Evaluation of Starmaya Under Agronomic Conditions The phenotypic characteristics of Marsellesa ® and Starmaya were evaluated in year 4 and are reported in  Table 4 . For all the phenotypic parameters studied (except the number of primary branch internodes at level 15 from the apex), the comparison showed that Starmaya plants were more vigorous than those of Marsellesa ® . For example, Starmaya plants were always significantly taller and had a larger collar diameter than Marsellesa ® . Moreover, Starmaya plants also had longer primary branches and larger internodes than those of Marsellesa ® . Regarding the yield assessment, the results presented in  Table 5  show that Starmaya produced 47% more than Marsellesa ® in 2015-2016 (first commercial harvest) and 29% more for the second commercial harvest  (2016) (2017) . The yield of Starmaya was still better than that of Marsellesa ® for the third harvest  (2017) (2018) . After three large yields, the experimental field was pruned. Considering the average harvests, Starmaya produced up to 35% more than Marsellesa ® under commercial growing conditions. These results confirmed the superiority of the Starmaya F1 hybrid compared with the Marsellesa ® cultivar. The Starmaya F1 hybrids grown from seeds displayed similar vigor and yields compared with other F1 hybrid clones propagated by SE  (Bertrand et al., 2005) . 
 Evaluation of Off-Types for the Tree Phenotype and Leaf Rust Resistance of Starmaya F1 Hybrids Phenotypic observations led to the identification of mean values of 3 and 16% of off-type plants in the fields of Marsellesa ® and Starmaya, respectively (  Table 6 ). These off-type plants were characterized by tall plants, brown young leaves, and rust susceptibility. These unexpected phenotypes were probably a consequence of pollen contamination by wind and/or insects. The significant percentage of off-type plants observed in Starmaya fields could also be explained by the fact that one of the two parents (or both) was not sufficiently genetically fixed, therefore, still containing residual heterozygosity. Consequently, the cross between the two parents gave rise to a heterogeneous hybrid population instead of a homogeneous F1 progeny. Regarding leaf rust resistance, field observations identified 1 and 8% of plants susceptible to this disease in Marsellesa ® and Starmaya, respectively. As Marsellesa ® is a Sarchimor, coming from a cross between ""Hibrido de Timor CIFC 832/2"" and Villa Sarchi CIFC 971/10, it carried at least seven dominant resistance genes (SH1, SH2, SH4, SH5, SH6, SH7, and SH9) conferring a large spectrum of resistance to leaf rust  (Eskes, 1989) . The 1% of susceptible plants observed in the Marsellesa ® field argues in favor of this cultivar not being fully fixed. On the other hand, the rust susceptibility still observed in the Starmaya F1 hybrid probably came from an illegitimate offspring resulting from alien pollination or from residual Marsellesa ® heterozygosity. Whatever the case, the fact that it was still possible to identify 16% of off-types and 8% of leaf rust-susceptible plants in the Starmaya F1 hybrid population is a disadvantage of hybrids propagated from seeds when compared with clonal F1 hybrids. Although off-types exist in F1 hybrid clones propagated by SE and are the result of somaclonal variation (aneuploidy), we have shown that a series of measures in the laboratory and nursery drastically limits their incidence of occurrence in the field (<1%)  (Bobadilla Landey et al., 2013) . 
 Bean Quality and Cup Quality The green bean size for Marsellesa ® and Starmaya was also investigated (  Table 7) . This analysis revealed that bean size distribution increased significantly in Starmaya compared with Marsellesa ® . For example, 25% of Starmaya green beans were retained by sieve 19, while the percentage was only 2.5 and 5.8 for Marsellesa ® and Caturra red, respectively. In addition, 70% of the total green beans from Caturra red and Marsellesa ® were retained by sieves 16 to 18, while the same percentage was retained by sieves 17 to 19 for Starmaya. With 98% of green exportable coffee, the gain for Starmaya in terms of exportable green beans was thus

In the world, there is considerable economic interest in producing the highest possible proportion of large size exportable beans  (Vaast et al., 2006) . In terms of cup quality, the results presented in  Table 8  show that the highest merit for aroma was obtained by Marsellesa ® beans. Beverages prepared with Starmaya and Marsellesa ® displayed the same slight fragrance of caramel, whereas Caturra red was characterized by a chocolate note. Marsellesa ® obtained better scores for acidity than the other Arabica samples. The same trend was observed for the overall flavor and aftertaste scores. The Starmaya beverage also had more body than Catura red and Marsellesa ® and more sweetness than Marsellesa ® . Regarding the merit score, Marsellesa ® obtained the highest value (83.13), corresponding to very good scores for coffee beans usually produced at this altitude in Nicaragua (i.e., 950 m above sea level), while Starmaya and Caturra red obtained 82.5 and 82.0, respectively. 
 SSR Analysis of the Hybrid and Its Progenitors In order to understand the frequency of off-types observed in Marsellesa ® and Starmaya, a genotypic analysis was performed with SSR markers developed in earlier studies. Ten plants of Marsellesa ® , of the sterile male CIR-SM01, and of the resulting F1 hybrid Starmaya were analyzed by SSR  (Table 9) . For Marsellesa ® , all the tested plants showed the same allelic patterns for marker numbers Sat 11, Sat 225, Sat 235, Sat 24, and Sat 254, which scored with similar alleles. Two alleles were observed for markers Sat 29, Sat 32, Sat 47, and Sat 207. Taking into account that C. arabica is    an allotetraploid (2n = 4x = 44) arising from natural hybridization between C. canephora and C. eugenioides  (Lashermes et al., 1999) , the observation of two bands was explained by the presence of two different loci in each sub-genome and two identical alleles for each locus for these markers. Under our study conditions, all the Marsellesa ® plants had the same allelic pattern, which tended to prove its high homozygosity. However, the presence of residual Marsellesa ® heterozygosity could not be ruled out, due to the limited number of SSR markers used (only 10 SSR markers). As regard the sterile male CIR-SM01, and for all SSR markers tested, all the plants presented the same patterns. This result was expected because all these plants were clonally propagated by SE. Markers Sat 11 and Sat 254 scored with similar alleles (homozygosity), while clearly residual heterozygosity was observed for marker loci Sat 32, Sat 24, and Sat 225, which identified the presence of three different alleles. We concluded that CIR-SM01 displayed constitutive heterozygosity that cannot be modified even when propagating the clone by SE. The Starmaya F1 hybrid was assumed to be heterozygous because it received one set of chromosomes transmitted by the pollen of Marsellesa ® and the ovule of CIR-SM01. In fact, different patterns were observed for Starmaya  (Table 10) . For example, two different patterns were detected with markers Sat 24 and Sat 32 for plants P8 and P9 (C1C3/C1C2C3 and D1D2D4/ D1D2D3, respectively) confirming that these markers were heterozygous in the sterile male parent. For the Starmaya P1 plant, two different alleles from both parents (alleles C4 and D5, respectively) were observed with marker loci Sat 24 and Sat 32. This result clearly indicates that this plant came from a cross-pollination involving alien pollen (i.e., not from Marsellesa ® ). On the other hand, no Starmaya F1 hybrid plants had SSR patterns identical to the sterile male CIR-SM01, indicating that ""sterile male × sterile male"" crosses did not occur, thereby confirming the strict sterile male character of this accession. To reduce the residual heterozygosity carried by the pollen of Marsellesa ® , we decided in 2017 to create new seed gardens using cultivars in generation F10. On the other hand, to avoid cross-pollination, we used windbreak hedges around the seed garden plot and protected the plants with an insect-proof net. Our current objective is to produce around one ton of Starmaya seeds in Nicaragua and Costa Rica in 2019, with a maximum of 5% off-types, which will be commercially acceptable. 
 CONCLUSION We demonstrated that Starmaya F1 hybrids had better agronomic characteristics in terms of vigor, bean size, and yield than the Marsellesa ® cultivar used as a parent or the Caturra red control. The Starmaya F1 hybrids also had a good cup quality compared with other traditional cultivars, such as Marsellesa ® and Caturra red. The results presented here are a proof of concept that it is possible to propagate a C. arabica F1 hybrid on a large scale from seeds, using the CIR-SM01 sterile male parent, by setting up seed gardens. The Starmaya cultivar is already included in the global catalog of the World Coffee Research foundation (https://varieties.worldcoffeeresearch. org/). The first commercial seeds (one ton) will be available in 2019. We believe that F1 hybrids produced using male sterility can produce low-cost seeds that will be readily available wherever Arabica is grown and that this innovation will reshape the coffee seed sector. Starmaya was recently recognized by the whole coffee industry as a promising cultivar representing a major breakthrough in the widespread production of F1 hybrids for farmers around the world (https:// dailycoffeenews.com/2017/03/13/new-starmaya-hybridcould-reshape-the-industry-says-world-coffee-research/). Under the BREEDCAFS H2020 European project (http://www. breedcafs.eu/), Starmaya has been introduced in Vietnam and Cameroon, where it is being compared with local varieties. On the other hand, new hybrids with the CIR-SM01 sterile male parent have been created and are under study. The number of F1 hybrid varieties that can be created by seed is limited by the number of sterile male plants that can be found in coffee collections of wild trees collected in the species' center of origin in Ethiopia. A consortium (World Coffee Research-CIRAD-Nestlé) is trying to identify male-sterility markers to

We highlighted a negative architectural response of two species to higher than average temperatures, whereas the third one took advantage of these higher temperatures to some degree. Tree architectural development weekly but significantly improved with higher precipitation. Our study underlines the strong weight of topology and ontogeny in tree growth patterns at twig and branch scales. The correlation between ASL and other tree architectural traits should be integrated into architectural development models. Climate variables are secondary in importance at the twig scale. However, interannual climate variations influence all axis categories and branching orders and therefore significantly impact crown development as a whole. This latter impact may increase with climate change, especially as climate affects architectural traits over at least 2 years, through organogenesis and elongation.","Buissart F., Vennetier M., Delagrange S., Girard F., Caraglio Y., Sabatier S.A., Munson A.D., Nicolini E.A.. 2018. The relative weight of ontogeny, topology and climate in the architectural development of three North American conifers. AoB Plants, 10 (4) : 147 p..  https://doi.org/10.1093/aobpla/ply045",22,20181022,"The relative weight of ontogeny, topology and climate in the architectural development of three North American conifers",,"Introduction Climate, as more generally environmental conditions, impacts plant growth and consequently plant architecture. The manner tree architecture regulates phenotypic plasticity is a specific response.  Kunstler et al. (2016) , through a global approach, suggest that some architectural traits are useful to model tree-crown competition and resulting forest communities. Understanding the response of tree architecture to climate variability is also challenging, but necessary to better assess and simulate forest response to climate change. Primary growth, driving architectural development in plants, corresponds to the creation of new tissues outside existing organs. For a tree, it includes growth length of existing axes (bole, branches and roots), branching processes (formation of new branches or roots), genesis and growth of leaves, needles and rootlets, and reproduction (flowering, fruiting)  (Hallé et al. 1978; Barthélémy and Caraglio 2007) . Spatial organization of axes (topology) combined with its changes over time (ontogeny) defines plant architecture. Plant architecture is the expression of a balance between endogenous, genetically or physiologically driven growth processes, and exogenous environmental constraints. Plant architectural analysis provides a comprehensive approach to understand plant development, with applications in many plant biology disciplines  (Kaplan 2001) . Describing and analysing tree architecture is a challenge: on the one hand, because of tree size, subsampling and destructive methods are required  (Barthelemy et al. 1989 ); on the other hand, the long life span of trees allows numerous endogenous and exogenous factors to interact with tree architecture. Indeed, tree development patterns change with age, life stages  (Chaubert-Pereira et al. 2009 ), competition or accidents such as wind or snow breaks, herbivory, climate extremes  (Poethig 1990; Barthélémy and Caraglio 2007) , and potentially with climate change in the long term  (Girard et al. 2011; Girard et al. 2012) . A coarse representation of tree crown architecture at different scales is widely used as a tool to study the forest canopy, for example, to assess light interception  (Honer 1971; Fournier et al. 1996) , to support remote sensing models  (Landry et al. 1997)  or to model forest vulnerability to fire  (Caraglio et al. 2007; Cruz and Alexander 2012) . Tree architecture also provides useful information to study carbon partitioning within trees  (Taugourdeau et al. 2012) , to build forest management scenarios  (Courbaud et al. 2001)  or to diagnose tree health status  (Innes 1998; Dobbertin 2005; Sabatier et al. 2014) . But except for tree height, few papers investigated the relationships between primary growth and climate variability  (Thabeet et al. 2009; Girard et al. 2012; Vennetier et al. 2013) . Such information is required to improve tree growth and architecture modelling, and is critical to accurately simulate future tree growth in the context of global change. Most existing tree development models use mean parameters averaged over entire branches or trees  (Barczi et al. 2008; Buck-Sorlin et al. 2008) , even though architectural traits of branch axes, as well as their response to climate, differ according to their position in the crown and in the branching hierarchy  (Girard et al. 2011) . Cold, including extreme frost and a short growing season, limits tree growth in high latitudes  (Gamache and Payette 2004) , and particularly in boreal forests  (Plasse and Payette 2015) . Increases in forest productivity may occur as climate warming allows a potentially longer growing season in cold-limited environments  (Chuine and Beaubien 2001) . But the positive effects of warming leading to advanced phenology in spring, and delay in autumn dormancy, can be offset by local adaptation of species, depending on factors such as photoperiod, chilling requirements, vernalization time or interactions with soil fertility and especially water status. Such offsets have been demonstrated at local to large scales under natural conditions  (Johnsen et al. 1996; Creed et al. 2015) , in controlled environments  (Li et al. 2015)  and by modelling  (Clark et al. 2014) . As an illustration of such limitations, recent studies reported cases of warming-induced decreases in tree growth: negative correlations were found between ring-width and warmer than average temperatures for several North American species, including black spruce-Picea mariana  (Walker and Johnstone 2014)  and eastern white cedar-Thuja occidentalis  (Housset et al. 2015) . Some of the responses present a north-south contrast logically related to a temperature gradient, with summer temperatures more important at the higher latitudes for black spruce, and east-west contrasts linked to a humidity gradient  (Nicault et al. 2014) . The aim of the present study was to understand the relationship between architectural development and a set of endogenous (ontogenic, topological) and exogenous (climate, site condition) variables for three frequent species of Canadian forests-black spruce, Jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and Eastern white pine (Pinus strobus). 3 While plant architecture is the result of meristem genetic regulation  (Chomicki et al. 2017 ) and can be useful to infer physiological mechanisms (i.e.  Peyhardi et al. 2017) , in this study we did not aim to further investigate the ecophysiological processes behind architectural development. We rather aimed to answer the following questions: (i) What are the interactions among measured architectural variables? (ii) How does interannual climate variability affect tree architectural development? (iii) What is the relative influence of climate variability, compared to ontogenic and topological factors in driving tree architectural development? 
 Methods 
 Study sites Study sites included two mature natural forests in southern Québec  (Canada) : 'Réserve Papineau-Labelle' (studied species-Eastern white pine) and 'Parc des Grands Jardins' (studied species-black spruce and Jack pine). The location of both sites and the range of each studied species are shown in  Fig. 1 . The Réserve Papineau (46°08′48″N, 75°09′49″W) is a temperate forest dominated by Acer saccharum and Betula alleghaniensis, accompanied by several species of oak, beech, linden and ash, and scattered stands of Eastern white pine. In our three plots, these pines were 87-year-old (SD 17 years), with mean diameter and height of, respectively, 38 cm (SD 5.8 cm) and 21.5 m (SD 4.2 m). This location, with elevation ranging between 200 and 500 m, has a cool temperate climate  (Rizzo and Wiken 1992) , with a mean annual temperature of 5.2 °C and annual precipitation of 924 mm (2000-13 data from Chénéville weather station, 45°53′22,762″N, 75°03′36,421″W; Environnement Canada 2016). The mineral soil is a sandy loam, overlain by a shallow layer of organic matter. The three plots mainly differ based on their slope and composition of the soil coarse fraction. The first plot is located at the bottom of a hill (slope between 0 and 5 %) with absence of rocks. The second is at the middle of a gentle slope (5-15 %) with presence of some scattered rocky outcrops, and the third is on the upper part of a steep slope (20-30 %) with large and numerous rocky elements. The Parc des Grands-Jardins (PGJ) is located in the Charlevoix highlands, about 120 km north-east of Quebec City  (Fig. 1) . The area is characterized by high hills with an average altitude between 700 and 900 m above sea level (a.s.l.), with several alpine and subalpine summits over 1000 m a.s.l. The average annual temperature is about 0 °C, the mean temperature of the warmest month (July) is 15 °C, and the average frost-free period of 60-70 days is among the shortest in southern Québec. Meteorological data from L'Étape Station located at  47°33′44″N, 71°13′44″W (1999-2013)  was the closest available.   
 Data acquisition We sampled 15 dominant trees per species, free from any significant competition with neighbours. Each tree consisted of one dominant main axis (trunk = order 1) bearing a crown made of lateral branches (order 2). For each tree of black spruce and Jack pine, we collected three coupled branches, respectively, in the top, middle and low crown, with opposite orientations within a couple  (Girard et al. 2011) . For Eastern white pine, due to the impossibility to harvest trees, no branches from the very top crown could be collected, and they were replaced by an additional pair of branches as high as possible in the middle of the crown. We also collected the whole top of the trunk and crown of three black spruce trees and one Jack pine. Tree age was estimated by counting rings from a core at breast height. Architectural and growth measurements were performed in the lab. Tree cores were glued to a support and sanded. Then, ring-width was measured using WinDendro  (Guay 2012) ; cross-validation and standardization were carried out according to standard procedures  (Payette and Filion 2010) . We considered the main axis of each trunk and branch, and for each main branch axis, two to three evenly distributed opposite couples of their twigs (branching order 3). Morphological markers like size and density of scales at the base of the growth units, lateral axes and position of cones were used to delimit growth units and annual shoots (one annual shoot can be composed of several growth units for polycyclic species). These markers allowed us to reconstruct axis primary growth for the last 12-15 years (markers fade and are no longer reliable for older shoots), following methods described by  Sabatier et al. (2003)  and  Pardos et al. (2003) . Then for selected axes, we considered the following dependant  (Table 1)  and explanatory variables  (Tables 2 and 3)  for each annual shoot. Annual shoot length (ASL) is by itself a dependent variable, but we used it as an explanatory factor for other architectural variables. This does not induce any circularity in the analyses. Although ASL is highly dependent on most topological and ontogenic factors, axis vigour is usually considered one of the main drivers of tree crown development  (Thabeet et al. 2009; Girard et al. 2011 Girard et al. , 2012 . Independently from ASL, this development also partially depends on the same topological and ontogenetic factors. The relative weight and role of axis vigour, axis hierarchy and branch position in the crown was disentangled by  Vennetier et al. (2013) , as well as in the above-mentioned references, validating the method used here. Moreover, the statistical method used for the analyses (partial least square (PLS) regression) is designed to free the results from the interactions between correlated variables. 
 Local variables (sites, trees and branches, climate) The autocorrelation aimed to determine the relative weight of climate variability, heritable vigour related to tree and branch health status, and local invariable (site) or more slowly changing ontogenic and topological variables (related to individual trees and branches). The relative vigour was used with the same goal, but was focused to more precisely analyse the role of hierarchical branching order. Local variables accounted for the portion of variability in architectural variables related to: (i) site effect-differences in soil fertility and topography among sites; (ii) tree effect-individual tree characteristics linked to genetics or growth history, and to local variations of soil and topographic conditions within a site; and (iii) branch effect-individual branches that differ according to their position in the crown (top, middle, low;  Thabeet et al. 2009; Girard et al. 2011 Girard et al. , 2012 . We eliminated biotic effects of competition and insects on branches by selecting those with minimal competition and no apparent past accidents (breakage or other damage). From raw data of the weather stations, we computed seasonal, monthly and bimonthly rainfall, temperature and degree-days (DD) for each site. Groups of 3 months were related to the main corresponding season: winter (January-March), spring (April-June), summer (July-September) and autumn (October-December). 
 Statistical analyses and modelling All the analyses were performed with R statistical software (version 2.15.1; R Core Team 2014). To each annual shoot, and its architectural and growth parameters, we associated climatic variables of both the year of elongation (year n) and the year of organogenesis (previous year n − 1. See details in Supporting Information-Appendix 2). For each architectural variable, a PLS regression was computed following the procedure of PLS in SIMCA software  (Eriksson et al. 2006) , which was translated in R to allow automatization of several variations of the analyses: linear PLS for ASL, NL and length of male flowers on the annual shoot, and logistic PLS  (Bastien et al. 2005)  for the number of male cones (black spruce), presence of male cones (pine species), number of branches (all in whorls for pines, whorled and interwhorl branches separately for black spruce), number of cones and polycyclism rate. We used r 2 and Q 2 statistics to evaluate the model, and the confidence interval of partial correlation coefficients to evaluate the significance of each variable. The r 2 reflects the fit of the model to our data set, whereas the Q 2 reflects the robustness of the model  (Tenenhaus 1998) . For each architectural parameter, we kept the best model according to Q 2 with only significant variables. For a detailed description of the method, see Supporting Information-Appendix 3. We finally focused on the variable importance in the projection (VIP), as described in  Tenenhaus (1998) . Variable importance in the projection is a coefficient >0, computed for each variable to reflect its relative weight in the model. As the sum of VIPs is always the total number of variables in the model, then variables with a VIP >1 are the most important for the prediction. Variable importance in the projection absolute values must not be compared among different analyses nor among species. Variable importance in the projection is determined as a relative weight within the set of significant variables for a given analysis. The fact that some architectural traits show higher VIPs in response to climate variables than other traits does not mean that they are more responsive to climate: the real impact of any variable depends on both the number of significant variables and of the global correlation coefficient of the model (r 2 and Q 2 ). When individual branches were significantly represented in the results of an analysis, with at least five top or medium and five low branches, we compared the VIPs mean or median of these classes with a t-test or a Mann-Whitney (Wilcoxon) test, respectively, depending on data distribution (normal or not). 
 Results 
 Mean architectural variables Annual shoot length, the total number of branches and whorled branches were highly variable, and decreased with age and with increasing branching order for all species  (Table 4) . On black spruce, branching rate showed an abrupt drop from the trunk to the third branching order. It decreased  Table 2 . Independent explanatory variables: topological variables. **Vigour index (ranging from 0 to 1 from the weakest to the strongest) is the probability of the value of the axis growth pattern for the age of the annual shoot in the normal distribution of shoot length values for this age within its hierarchical order. 
 Variable Description Order    Table 4 . Descriptive statistics of studied architectural variables by species, axis hierarchical order and ontogenic age: mean, SD, range and percentage of occurrence. In Age column, the number in brackets is the number of observations. In the columns for ASL, needle length (NL), number of male cones for black spruce (N ♂), length of male cones on annual shoot for pines (Lg ♂), number of female cones (N ♀), number of branches in the pseudowhorl for black spruce and in the whorl for pines (whorl ram) and number of interwhorl branches for black spruce (int ram), the first row of each cell corresponds to the mean, the second row (in italic) to the SD, the third row, between square brackets, to the range of the variable (if SD > 0). For N ♂ and Lg ♂ for pines, a fourth row gives the percentage of twigs bearing male cones. Polycyclism column (polyc) reports for each number of cycles (1-3) the percentage of concerned axes. 7 more rapidly for interwhorl than for whorl branches: this species had about three times more interwhorl than whorled branches on vigorous axes (annual young shoots from order 1 and 2), interwhorl branches nearly disappearing on order 3, but not whorls. Needle length had a lower variability than branching rate among branching orders and with age, particularly in the case of black spruce, characterized by needles that did not shorten with axis age. Needle length also had by far the lowest variation coefficients (computed from mean and SD given in  Table 4 ) within each branching order and age class (0.17 % ± 0.05), compared to all other architectural traits (from 0.56 % ± 0.22 for ASL to 1.65 % ± 0.90 for int ram). Male and female cones could be found together on the same annual shoot in black spruce but never in pine species. For black spruce, male cones were not found on the trunk, whereas female cones were absent at branching orders 2 and 3 for old axes. Female cones were quite rare for Eastern white pine. Polycyclism was found only on pines, systematically on Jack pine vigorous shoots, but more rarely on Eastern white pine (<2 % of annual shoots of the most polycyclic category). 
 Species As we investigated many architectural variables for the three species, with several options for each model, we do not display all the detailed results. However, we present, as an example, the detailed results for one of these variables-ASL; details of all other analyses are presented in Supporting Information-Appendix 4. To fulfil our objectives, only the relative weight of predictors and the sign of the correlation are presented  (Figs 3 and 4) . Partial least square analyses were performed with all variables together (topology, ontogeny, climate and local variables), but synthetic results are presented in three parts for better comprehension: (i) topology and ontogeny  (Fig. 3) , to highlight the weight of tree-related factors on architectural development; (ii) climate  (Fig. 4) , to show the influence of interannual climate variability and the potential impact of climate change; and finally (iii) local variables [see Supporting Information-Appendix 4], to demonstrate the influence of branch position in the crown.  Figure 2A -C plots partial correlation coefficients and VIPs of the PLS regression for ASL, for black spruce (Q 2 = 62.6 %, R 2 = 63.3 %), Eastern white pine (Q 2 = 79.4 %, R 2 = 79.5 %) and Jack pine (Q 2 = 73.6 %, R 2 = 74.2 %), respectively. Ontogenic and topological variables had the highest contribution to the model (VIP > 1). Other significant variables, including those related to climate, had less weight in the model. For the three species, the best predictors were the length of the previous annual shoot (autocorrelation), the relative vigour index and the branching order, ASL decreasing with increasing order. For Jack pine, many local factors (site, tree, branch) but only two or three climatic variables had a significant influence. Conversely, for Eastern white pine, only site was significant among local factors, while climate variables were more represented, although all weaker. Black spruce was the only species with VIPs above 0.75 for climatic variables; a negative correlation was noted for this species with previous-year winter absolute maximum temperature. For Eastern white pine, degree * days and temperature were dominant in the response to climate; a positive impact of moderate temperatures (neither too hot, nor too cold) of the current and previous years (DD 8-13, minimum temperature of current summer) was observed, as well as a negative impact of a very hot previous summer (maximum temperature and DD 18-20). The response of Jack pine to temperature was weak, with a positive influence of previous February absolute maximum temperature and a negative response to previous July absolute minimum temperature. 
 Annual shoot length Because of the low number of significant local variables in ASL models, branch positions could only be compared statistically in these models for Jack pine, showing higher signed VIPs in top crown compared to low crown. For the other two species, low crown was consistently represented with only negative coefficients.  Figure 3A -C presents the VIPs and the sign of the partial correlation coefficients of topological and ontogenic variables for black spruce, Eastern white pine and Jack pine, respectively. For the three studied species, ASL had a dominant influence on architectural development. Except for the number of male cones of black spruce, it was significant for all variables, with a high VIP (>1) in >50% of the cases, particularly for branching and needle length. The probability of a branch to develop male cones was negatively correlated with ASL for both pine species. Conversely, within the short annual shoots bearing male cones, the length of the axis bearing these cones increased for both species with shoot length. All variables were negatively correlated with axis hierarchical order, except male cones, which were more frequent in high orders, and black spruce needles, that were shorter on the trunk than on branches. Branch relative vigour was less relevant than both ASL and branch hierarchical order, with no influence on architectural variables for either black spruce or Jack pine. It was, however, significant with a high VIP for polycyclism, fructification and branching in Eastern white pine. The autocorrelation (previous-year value) was important in ASL and needle length for all species, for male cones in pine species, and in the branching rate of black spruce and Eastern white pine. In contrast, autocorrelation had no weight in fructification of any species, nor in polycyclism; these variables showed sharp 9 changes from a given year to the next within branches. Shoot length was negatively correlated with axes age for all species, demonstrating a clear impact of aging on absolute vigour of axes, despite the small VIP associated with age. Age also influenced negatively black spruce male cone number and Eastern white pine branching. 
 Topological and ontogenic variables Branch position in the crown had a significant influence on architectural variables. The number of male cones, of interwhorl branches and of cones for black spruce, as well as the probability of male cones for Eastern white pine and the ASL of Jack pine, showed a higher VIP for top than for low branches (Annex 4, tables BS3, BS4, BS6, EWP2, JP1).  Figure 4A -C shows the VIPs and the sign of the partial correlation coefficients of climate variables for black spruce, Eastern white pine and Jack pine, respectively. 
 Climatic variables Higher temperatures during elongation led to a decline in shoot length growth for black spruce and Jack pine, as well as a decline in branching and polycyclism for Jack pine, thus in crown development as a whole. Conversely, their reproduction (both male and female cones) was stimulated. However, for Eastern white pine, shoot length and male cone production were boosted by higher temperatures, while female cone production and branching rates were reduced. For this later species, polycyclism increased with higher temperatures from late summer of year n − 1 to autumn of year n, but declined with higher temperatures from the middle of spring to the middle of summer of year n − 1. For both pines, a hotter summer in year n increased needle length of year n. But Eastern white pine needle length was also strongly influenced by the temperature in spring n − 1 (positively), and in summer n − 1 and both winter and spring n (negatively). Surprisingly, black spruce needle length was negatively, but very weakly, related to temperatures of spring n − 1. Its interwhorl branching pattern was independent from climate. For the three studied species in general, precipitation had less influence than temperature on architectural development and reproduction, with a few exceptions; ASL for the three species, and male flowering for Eastern white pine, were strongly favoured by higher precipitation. To a lesser extent, black spruce male flowering and Jack pine branching rate also benefited from a rainy summer n and autumn n − 1, respectively. Precipitation was negatively correlated with black spruce branching rate and had variable effects on Eastern white pine polycyclism. 
 Discussion 
 The strong weight of ontogeny and topology Our results showed that the development of tree crown and reproduction were mainly controlled by ASL and by variables related to branch topology (branching order,  Figure 3 . Dependant topological and ontogenic variables for all models, for black spruce (A), Eastern white pine (B) and Jack pine (C) vs. independent explanatory variables. Positive correlation appears in greyscale, whereas negative correlation appears with dots and hatchings. A star for Q 2 and R 2 indicates a logistic regression model, hence R 2 and Q 2 correspond to McFadden pseudo-R 2 calculation method  (McFadden 1973  Annual shoot length was the main driver of architectural development at the local scale. Axis vigour was consistently the strongest explanatory factor for architectural development in previous studies  (Girard et al. 2011 (Girard et al. , 2012 . For both pines and spruce, ASL was strongly correlated with branch position in the crown, thus with branch age, in accordance with  Colombo et al. (2006) . For young to adult conifers, ASL also decreased from the hierarchical order 1 (trunk) to the following Positive coefficients appear in grey scale, whereas negative ones appear with dots and hatchings. T stands for temperature, R for précipitation, Wint for winter (January-March), Sprg for spring (April-June), Sumr for summer (July-September) and Fall for October-December. The last columns on the right give the Q 2 and r 2 for each model.

As a consequence, shoot length could be considered as an integrating trait for branch intrinsic vigour, position and hierarchy. Functionally, shoot length also reflects physiological age of apical meristems (Barthélémy and Caraglio 2007), which reinforces the necessity to (i) compute this trait in architectural modelling and (ii) consider it in the set of explanatory variables when studying other architectural traits (e.g. branching rates, needle length and number, polycyclism, reproduction). Accordingly, the strong weight of autocorrelation for most variables was related to multiple interacting effects controlling the mean ASL independently from shoot hierarchical level and position: (i) site mean fertility for all trees of a given site; (ii) intertree variations (genetics, specific position in the site, tree history); (iii) at the branch scale, mean vigour status and age; (iv) the dependence of each annual shoot on the general conditions during bud morphogenesis, occurring in year n − 1  (Hover et al. 2017) ; and (v) the ability of trees to build up reserves to be used later, if the climate is favourable in autumn n − 1  (Körner 2003) . Independently from branch vigour, architectural variables can vary due to branch position in the crown, as already shown on both conifers  (Thabeet et al. 2009 ) and broad-leaved species  (Normand et al. 2009 ). Consistently, individual branch label [see Supporting Information-Appendix 4] influenced several variables for the three studied species, although shoot length and branch vigour were included in the analyses. However, the comparison of VIPs between branches from high and low crown in our model outputs was an indirect measure of the influence of branch position: branch position in the crown should be used directly as an additional independent topological variable in future investigations  (Girard et al. 2011 (Girard et al. , 2012 . Branch hierarchy had a significant influence on most architectural variables, for all studied species  (Fig. 3) . However, axis relative vigour  (Fig. 5 ) had no influence on architectural variables and reproduction of black spruce and Jack pine. For these latter two species, branching order was a strong driver  (Colombo and Templeton 2006)    (Fig. 3) , lessening the relative weight of shoot length in trait variations within each order. Axis relative vigour was, however, significant for branching, polycyclism and cone production in Eastern white pine. This is due to larger variations of these variables and of axis vigour within each branching order (high relative SD;  Table 4 ). Such variability lessens the influence of branching order for this species  (Fig. 3B)  and proportionally increases the weight of axes relative vigour. In this study, we sampled only relatively young adult trees, for which the freshly established structure and axis hierarchy is stable. The branching order should be considered with caution for older trees, for which loss of branch vitality with aging and branch mortality lead to their partial replacement by reiteration processes that break growth hierarchy between axes (Bégin and Filion 1999; Millet 2012). Although highly time-consuming, sampling orders 4 and higher would be useful for a more accurate description and modelling of the tree crown. 
 Climate variability impacts crown development The lower VIP for climate variables compared to ontogenic and topological variables does not suggest a low impact of climate on each branch, but instead a higher variability of architectural variables among sites, trees or branches than among years. This was the case, for example, for branching rates of most species, but also for ASL, which decreased sharply with both branch hierarchical order and age (from 2 to 5 times less from one order or age class to the other;  Table 4 ). Comparatively, branching rate and ASL interannual variation along individual axes, due to climate, was limited to 20-50 % in this study. This response is consistent with previous studies  (Girard et al. 2012; Feichtinger et al. 2015) , and explains the low VIPs of climate variables in our results. Moreover, topological and ontogenic variables (position in the crown, hierarchical order, age of the tree, age of the branch and its relative vigour in its order) are fixed from the birth of the branch or evolve slowly and then have a fixed and monotonous effect with no or very low interannual variability. Conversely, climate leads to frequent interannual variations and to cumulative and additive effects, through long-lasting consequences of either a reduced branching rate or series of short needles or reduced needle number  (Feichtinger et al. 2015) ;  Vennetier et al. (2013)  showed that a branching deficit, limiting potential leaf number, or reduced leaf number and size following repeated climate stresses, hold back tree leaf area. Such a reduction in leaf area, and thus light interception, may limit plant growth potential and vegetation productivity  (Monteith 1977) . Climate-related biotic attacks on weakened trees  (Marini et al. 2012 ) also lengthen the recovery period. The negative role of high temperatures from spring to autumn observed in shoot growth and architectural development of black spruce and Jack pine, and particularly the strong effect of maximum temperatures, was consistent with previous studies. Black spruce shows a reduction in the tree ring-width during or following hot years  (Dang and Lieffers 1989; Nicault et al. 2014; Housset et al. 2015; Walker et al. 2015) . This species seems more vulnerable to warming, and to the high water vapour deficit induced by warming  (Van Herk et al. 2011) , than to short droughts at normal temperature  (Belien et al. 2012 ). This vulnerability is consistent throughout a large range of sites, including more fertile and cool sites  (Walker and Johnstone 2014) . Therefore, a large part of the contemporary distribution of black spruce, particularly at its southern edge, is predicted to be lost or threatened by 2060  (Joyce and Rehfeldt 2017) . In addition, its radial growth may decrease at low latitudes, south of 47°N  (Huang et al. 2010) . For Jack pine,  Wang et al. (2012)  forecast an increase of productivity for a hotter climate with high precipitation, but a reduction in the case of reduced precipitation within the same time frame. This leads to potential interactions between climate and site conditions. On the shallow xeric soils of our studied sites, higher temperature may lead to water shortage in summer, which could explain the detrimental influence of maximum temperature of the growing season  (Figs 2 and 4) . A positive effect could exist on deep soils with a good water-holding capacity.  Girardin et al. (2016)  confirm a recent intensification of the impacts of hydroclimatic variability on the radial growth of both Jack pine and black spruce; these impacts seem mainly driven by a negative sensitivity to previous summer temperature and a positive sensitivity to summer soil moisture of both previous and current years.  Guillemette et al. (2017)  show that the annual risk of mortality in northern hardwoods and mixed woods of Quebec is 3.6 times lower where annual temperature is low (2.3 % at 0.8 °C) than in a location where annual temperature is high (8.1 % at 4 °C). In parallel, we observed a positive correlation of tree crown development with winter temperatures and with minimum temperature in summer or spring, for the three studied species. This trend could be related to: (i) the detrimental impact of deep frost in winter, which can affect shoot terminal buds, and (ii) the need for sufficiently high minimum temperatures in the short growing season, but without extremes, in order to launch and sustain tree physiological activity. These thresholds of minimum temperatures are particularly critical in spring, for the activation of photosynthesis and respiration  (Rayment and Jarvis 1999) . They are also important in autumn to sustain root growth (De  Barba et al. 2016) , allow late polycyclism  (Fig. 4B ) and to build up carbohydrate reserves when photosynthesis remains active, while C sink demand for primary growth is limited  (Körner 2003) . Consistently and for the same reasons, very low temperatures in winter contribute to higher tree mortality rates during the following year in Europe, particularly in its northern regions  (Neumann et al. 2017) . Unlike Jack pine and black spruce, Eastern white pine was not negatively affected by high temperatures.  (Girardin et al. 2016)  show that its radial growth is not influenced by temperature in any season and we reported that shoot length growth was even favoured by higher temperature in our sites  (Fig. 4B) . The positive correlation between polycyclism and high temperature of the current growing season, and the negative correlation between polycyclism and high temperatures of the past year  (Fig. 4B ), may not be contradictory but may rather show an interdependency. Indeed, two growth units can be prepared in the terminal bud of elongating shoots, as observed for other polycyclic species  (Hover et al. 2017 ). If temperatures are high enough during of a given growing season, the first of these units can develop as a second cycle for the current year, and only the second unit remains thus available at the beginning of the next growing season. If the first unit does not develop, two growth units are available for next year, increasing the probability of polycyclism, even without high temperatures. Moreover, as demonstrated by  Buissart et al. (2015)  through shoot pith diameter, organogenesis is competing for resources with primary growth during year n − 1. Therefore, climate conditions enabling a prolonged vigorous growth in the autumn of any given year may lead to fewer potential internodes prepared in the bud for the following year. The three studied species followed the normal patterns of conifers for reproduction  (Figs 3 and 4) ; male cones were more abundant or frequent in high branching orders (here mainly order 3) and on the weak axis  (Caraglio et al. 2007; Thabeet et al. 2009; Ne'eman et al. 2011) , while female cones were mainly limited to the trunk or main branches (order 2) and to the most vigorous axes. Consistently, high temperatures which weaken trees and limit shoot growth also reduced female cone numbers and increase investment in pollen production  (Fig. 4) . The lack of influence of autocorrelation with fructification, whatever the species, shows that despite the weight of branch position, vigour and hierarchy in reproduction patterns, interannual climate variability and the intrinsic irregularity of tree reproduction  (Pearse et al. 2017 ) constrain cone production. Compared to temperature, the rainfall variability had little influence on the shoot growth and architectural development of the three studied species. As only one drought was recorded in the last 15 years in the study areas, this lack of statistical responsiveness of tree development to precipitation patterns was not surprising. However, we observed evidence of the potential role of precipitation in a changing climate; higher precipitation in autumn n − 1 or winter (the periods and their length differ among species) improved shoot length of the three species and branching rate for Jack pine  (Fig. 4) . As most of the precipitation in late autumn and winter occurs as snow, it can be interpreted as (i) a protection of the soil against extreme frost, and (ii) a longlasting water reserve released in spring which could be reduced in the future  (Creed et al. 2015) , inducing water stress for the growing season. Globally, the response of the studied species to climate, and particularly the negative role of high temperature in the case of Jack pine and black spruce, confirmed that the theoretical improvement of tree growth and forest productivity with global change (lengthening of the growing season and elevated atmospheric CO 2 ) could be offset by many other factors such as genetics, responsiveness to the photoperiod or vernalization processes. These important factors of tree plasticity and acclimation are set to optimize tree growth and survival with present and recent climate and site conditions  (Clark et al. 2014; Creed et al. 2015) . Any change that unbalances these relationships, and particularly any increase in drought stress, may put trees at risk  (Choat et al. 2012) , even if drought occurs for only a short period in summer, in cold-limited Canadian forests  (Walker et al. 2015) . However, Eastern white pine seems able to increase growth in response to slightly higher temperatures, provided that drought stress does not increase concurrently. Both Jack pine and black spruce bear semiserotinous cones that constitute an aerial seed bank released under the heat of crown fires or after desiccation  (Schooley et al. 1979; Pinard 1999) . The increase in cone production with higher temperatures (  Fig. 4A  and C) may help these species to regenerate after episodes of forest dieback due directly to drought stress, or to a rise in wildfire frequency or biotic disturbances associated with such droughts. For Eastern white pine, the trend to limited cone production with higher temperatures in summer n − 1  (Fig. 4B ) may be compensated by the opposite trend in shoot length growth and branch vigour that may improve in a slightly warmer climate, sustaining cones production. Due to the limited number of cones observed on studied Eastern white pine trees, this last result should be considered with prudence. 
 Conclusions Endogenous factors (ontogeny and topology) appeared more important drivers of adult tree architectural development than climate variability (exogenous factor) at branch and twig level. A similar study is required for other ontogenic stages, especially young trees in the establishment phase, to better understand the behaviour and survival of tree species in a context of global climate change. Most of the architectural and growth traits studied depended on both the previous year (organogenesis) and present growing season (organ growth). This suggests that extreme climate events have at least a 2-year-long impact on tree development, as most of the traits are interdependent. In fact, these events probably have far longer effects, as suggested by the significant weight of autocorrelation that may prolong the immediate consequences. Although dominated by endogenous factors, the architectural development of tree crown as a whole was also clearly dependent on interannual climate variability for studied species  (Fig. 4) . But the detailed climate signals may have been partly hidden by the analyses which Figure 1 . 1 Map locating study sites and the range of studied species within the study area.

A strong precipitation gradient exists between L'Étape 
(1963-2013) and the PGJ former station (La Galette 
47°43′52″, 70°43′31″; 1963-74). The gradient represents 
a decrease of 33 % of annual precipitation in the PGJ that 
was accounted for in the calculations and interpretation 
of results. The vegetation in the PGJ forms a mosaic of 
open and closed forests, where black spruce (P. mariana) 
is the dominant tree species. Eastern larch (Larix laricina), 
balsam fir (Abies balsamea) and paper birch (Betula papy-
rifera) are growing in moderately to poorly drained sites 
preserved from extensive logging. The black spruce forests 
in the PGJ area are found on well-drained, acidic podzol 
soils of the Malbaie River Basin. The soils are composed of 
fluvio-glacial sands and gravel in valleys and heterometric 
till on slopes. Conifer forests in the Park are subject to sev-
eral disturbances, including insect outbreaks (spruce bud-
worm, Choristoneura fumiferana) and fires. Several forest 
tracts were also harvested before the creation of the Park 
in 1981. Three recorded insect outbreaks occurred during 
the 20th century, with the last one extending from the 
mid-1970s to the mid-1980s (Boisclair 1990).

Where we are today?,,"International coconut nomenclature Standardization of coconut cultivar names has been undertaken for decades. During the first COGENT meeting held in Montpellier, France in May 1992, representatives from national collections tried to clarify the status of existing collections and outlined what would become the Coconut Genetic Resources Database (CGRD). Coconut nomenclature has been quite specific since 1992, when researchers were asked to systematically provide an international name to any accessions they collect. It is unclear why and by whom this requirement was established, although COGENT believes that this nomenclature rule has strongly influenced users' representations of coconut diversity and the conservation of coconut germplasm at the global level. The guidelines ""Useful definitions of terms and nomenclature"" has been released as an annex in the book ""Coconut genetic resources"" 1 published in 2005 by Bioversity and available on the COGENT website. These guidelines were also more recently published in the ""Catalogue of conserved germplasm"" 2 , together with an extensive list of international names of coconut cultivars. The researchers in charge of the national coconut genetic resources programme are responsible for giving international names to the germplasm from their country. However, they are prompted to follow these specific guidelines in order to achieve international standardization. Accessions are generally named just after the accession has been planted in the ex situ genebank. These names start to become ""international"" only when the passport data of the collected germplasm has been transmitted to the CGRD, serving de facto as an international reference. The COGENT secretariat, which has been acting as CGRD manager, has made sure that the new names meet the nomenclature rules and, if necessary interacts with national researchers to adjust the proposed name accordingly. For instance, a new international name must not duplicate any previously recorded name (including synonyms and abbreviations). Once the first version of the CGRD was released, twenty COGENT member-countries were visited by CIRAD experts. National researchers were trained in generating and inputting data into the database. These visits offered many opportunities to interact with national researchers about the names of coconut germplasm. Presently, the only names which have an international status are those of accessions that are conserved in ex situ genebanks and recorded in the CGRD. Lists of these names are released on the COGENT website as a FAQ (frequently asked question) 3 . Beyond that housed in the ex situ genebanks, coconut germplasm does not have registered international names. 
 Global Strategy for the Conservation and Use of Coconut Genetic Resources In 1991, Dr Hugh Harries (1991) tried to develop a ""Coconut Registration Authority"", but this proposal was not further developed. A more complete list of coconut cultivars does exist and is based on this early initiative 4 and the subsequent work of some CIRAD researchers. This list has not yet been officially published or released, due to lack of time availability of the researchers involved in its maintenance, and lack of known formal procedures to ratify an official registration. Each accession planted in a COGENT ex situ genebank has to be registered under at least a cultivar name and an abbreviation. National researchers were advised not to create a new cultivar name for each and every sample they collected in farmers' fields. For that purpose, the notion of population within a cultivar was introduced in the nomenclature as follows: ""Populations could denote minor geographical and/or phenotypic differentiation within a cultivar"". This helped limit the unwanted proliferation of cultivar names which could lead to unnecessary and costly conservation of the same germplasm accessions under different cultivar names. There still remain differences between countries regarding the way they are naming the accessions. For instance, researchers in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka recently named many accessions as populations of already existing cultivars, whereas Indonesian researchers continue to give many new cultivar names to the accessions they collect. As for other crops, also a coconut cultivar should have characteristics that distinguish it from any other known cultivar. In reality, within a large network of 39 countries, this principle is sometimes difficult to meet and check. The standardized characterization and evaluation data existing in the CGRD help to compare accessions and cultivars conserved in different countries. Using international names in scientific publications is highly recommended. Whilst there may be good reasons to use another name, it is good practice to include a list establishing links between the alternative names and the international names. 
 Methodologies for conserving coconut genetic resources For many crop plants, germplasm can be stored as dried seeds and at low temperatures. Coconut seeds are recalcitrant: they germinate naturally using the free water available inside the coconut and germination can be prevented if the germ-pore cover remains dry due to dryness in the adjacent fibres of the husk (M. Foale, personal communication). Seednuts cannot normally survive the drying process, nor can they be stored below 8°C. Therefore, coconut germplasm can be maintained in vivo as living 			 See URL: http://www.cogentnetwork.org/images/publications/Coconut_genetic_resources.pdf 2 See URL : http://www.cogentnetwork.org/conserved-germplasm-catalogue 3 Which Coconut germplasm is presently conserved by COGENT country members?
